Item 2.
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Our fiscal year begins on April1 and ends on March31. Unless otherwise noted, references to  year  pertain to our fiscal year. For example, 2017 refers to fiscal 2017, which is the period from April1, 2016 to March31, 2017.  The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on January10, 2017. In addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. For more information, see the section below entitled  Forward Looking Statements.   We consolidate all of our joint ventures for purposes of GAAP, except for our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture.  Overview  We are the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the underground construction and infrastructure marketplace. Our innovative products are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform, our overall product breadth and scale and our manufacturing excellence. In the United States, our national footprint combined with our strong local presence and broad product offering make us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $10.8 billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity.  Our products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following our entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, our pipe products have been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets. This has allowed us to consistently gain share and achieve above-market growth throughout economic cycles. We expect to continue to drive conversion to our products from traditional materials as contractors, civil design engineers and municipal agencies increasingly acknowledge the superior physical attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products. In addition, we believe that overall demand for our products will benefit as the regulatory environment continues to evolve.  Our broad product line includes HDPE pipe, PP pipe and related water management products. Building on our core drainage businesses, we have aggressively pursued attractive ancillary product categories such as storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings and filters, and water quality filters and separators. We refer to these ancillary product categories as Allied Products. Given the scope of our overall sales and distribution platform, we have been able to drive growth within our Allied Products and believe there are significant growth opportunities going forward.     - 17 -     Results of Operations  Three Months Ended December31, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended December31, 2015  The following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net sales that have been derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We believe this presentation is useful to investors in comparing historical results.      Net sales. Net sales were $294.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016, decreasing $18.1 million, or 5.8%, over the comparable period in fiscal year 2016.        Domestic net sales decreased $12.4 million, or 4.7%, in the three months ended December 31, 2016, over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. Our domestic pipe sales decreased by $14.1 million, or 7.2%, which was a result of both pipe volume decreases of $9.4 million and price decreases of $4.6 million. The agriculture market has experienced continued sales decreases. Allied product sales increased $1.7 million, or 2.4%.  International net sales decreased $5.7 million, or 12.3%, in the three months ended December 31, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily attributable to pipe volume decreases of $2.6 million, partially offset by price increases of $1.4 million in our international markets and a decrease in Allied products sales of $3.8 million.   Cost of goods sold and Gross profit. Cost of goods sold decreased by $12.7 million, or 5.3%, and gross profit decreased by $5.4 million, or 7.2%, in the three months ended December 31, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year.      The decrease in domestic gross profit of $6.0 million, or 9.0%, was impacted by the decrease in domestic net sales of 4.7% and higher transportation and manufacturing costs, partially offset by lower raw material costs compared to the comparable fiscal year 2016 period.  International gross profit increased $0.6 million, or 6.9%, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016, largely due to the impact of lower raw material costs more than offset the impact of the decrease in international net sales of 12.3% over the comparable fiscal year 2016 period.     - 18 -     Selling expenses. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses were 7.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to 6.9% in the prior year. Selling expenses were essentially flat.  General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2016 increased $2.3 million from the prior year period. Restatement-related costs decreased $1.2 million was offset by increased staff levels, increased use of outside consultants in various corporate functions and a decrease in the benefit from stock-based compensation of $1.4 million.  Loss (gain) on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities . In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company shortened the remaining useful life of certain assets related to two manufacturing facilities resulting in accelerated depreciation expense of less than $2 million. One facility closed in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and ADS committed to a plan to reduce production at the other facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.  Intangible amortization . Intangible amortization remained relatively flat.  Interest expense . Our average overall outstanding debt was down by $51.6 million, or 13.5%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 compared to the average balance outstanding for the quarter ended December 31, 2015. The impact of lower debt outstanding on interest expense was partially offset by higher average capital lease obligations for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2015, which resulted in lower overall interest expense in the current year period.  Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net . Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net improved from losses of $2.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 to gains of $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. During the quarter ended December 31, 2016, we benefited from unrealized gains on fuel option derivatives of $0.9 million compared to unrealized losses of $0.7 million in the comparable period last year. In addition, a $1.1 million decrease in realized hedging losses was recognized compared to the prior year, primarily in connection with realized losses on propylene material swaps.  Income tax expense . For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had effective tax rates of 33.8% and 42.1%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the timing of certain discrete items.  Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates represents our proportionate share of income or loss attributed to two unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have significant influence, but not control, over operations. The net loss increased due to our portion of the loss of inventory due to a fire as discussed in Note 3. Fair Value Measurements.  Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest . Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased from a loss of $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 to net income of $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The change is primarily attributable to improvement in the profitability of ADS-Mexicana.   Nine Months Ended December31, 2016 Compared With Nine Months Ended December31, 2015  The following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net sales that have been derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We believe this presentation is useful to investors in comparing historical results.         - 19 -     Net sales. Net sales totaled $1,013.1 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2016, decreasing $32.2 million, or 3.1%, over the comparable period in fiscal year 2016.        Domestic net sales decreased $13.4 million, or 1.5%, in the nine months ended December 31, 2016, over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. Our domestic pipe sales decreased by $27.6 million, or 4.2%, which was primarily a result of net price decreases of $12.6 million and decreases of $14.9 million in net volume. The agriculture market has experienced continued sales decreases. Allied product sales increased $14.2 million, or 6.0%, which included the impact of the acquisition of BaySaver, as well as increased sales volume of products sold primarily into the non-residential and infrastructure end markets.  International net sales decreased $18.8 million, or 12.3%, in the nine months ended December 31, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease resulted from lower pipe volumes of $15.6 million offset by net price increases of $2.5 million in Mexico and Canada, along with a decrease of $2.5 million from a weaker Canadian dollar and Mexican Peso to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. There was also a decrease in Allied products sales.  Cost of goods sold and Gross profit. Cost of goods sold decreased by $52.9 million, or 6.5%, and gross profit increased by $20.7 million, or 8.8%, in the nine months ended December 31, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year.      The increase in domestic gross profit of $23.7 million, or 11.6%, was primarily the result of lower raw material costs, partially offset by a decrease of sales. Growth in sales of higher margin Allied Products also contributed to the overall increase in gross profit.  International gross profit decreased $3.0 million, or 9.4%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016, largely due to decreases in sales volume, partially offset by lower raw material costs.  Selling expenses. Selling expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 increased $3.3 million, or 5.1% over the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in bad debt expense of $1.5 million resulting from the deterioration of certain customer accounts, as well as the investment in additional sales coverage. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses increased to 6.8% for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 6.3% in the prior year period.  General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 increased $13.6 million over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses for audit, tax, legal and other professional fees related to the restatement of prior period financial statements from $16.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 to $21.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. In addition, stock-based compensation expense increased from benefit of $2.5 million for fiscal 2016 to expense of $2.6 million for fiscal 2017. Additional increases were a result of increased staff levels and increased use of outside consultants in various corporate functions.  Loss (gain) on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company shortened the remaining useful life of certain assets related to two manufacturing facilities resulting in accelerated depreciation expense of less than $2 million. One facility closed in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and ADS committed to a plan to reduce production at the other facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.     - 20 -     Intangible amortization . Intangible amortization remained relatively flat.  Interest expense . Our average overall outstanding debt was down by $39.0 million, or 10.6%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the average balance outstanding for the nine months ended December 31, 2015. The impact of lower debt outstanding on interest expense was more than offset by higher average capital lease obligations for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, which resulted in relatively flat interest expense.  Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net . Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net improved from losses of $18.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 to gains of $5.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, we benefited from unrealized gains on swaps for propylene raw material of $8.0 million compared to unrealized losses of $7.4 million in the comparable period last year. In addition, a $3.8 million decrease in fuel hedging losses were recognized compared to the prior year period. In addition, the nine months ended December 31, 2015 included a loss of $0.5 million recognized for the fair value remeasurement of the Company s original investment in BaySaver at the time the Company acquired a controlling interest in July 2015, whereas there was no comparable amount in the current year period. The remainder of the change is primarily related to foreign exchange gains.  Income tax expense . For the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had effective tax rates of 38.7% and 35.2%, respectively. The current year rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to state and local income taxes andnon-deductibleexpenses, partially offset by foreign income taxed at lower rates. For the nine months ended December 31, 2015, uncertain tax positions related to foreign jurisdictions were released due to the lapse of statute of limitations.  Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates represents our proportionate share of income or loss attributed to two unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have significant influence, but not control, over operations as well as our proportional share of BaySaver earnings up until the July 17, 2015 step acquisition. The net loss increased due to our portion of the loss of inventory due to a fire as discussed in Note 3. Fair Value Measurements. Our proportional share of BaySaver earnings was $0.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, whereas there was no comparable amount in the nine months ended December 31, 2016.  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest . Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased from $4.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 to $2.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. The change is primarily attributable to a decrease in the profitability of ADS-Mexicana.   Non-GAAP Financial Measures  In addition to financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, System-Wide Net Sales, Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share and Free Cash Flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.  Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measure. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:           (a)  Includes our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In addition, these amounts include our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our BaySaver Joint Venture prior to our step acquisition of BaySaver on July 17, 2015, which was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting.    (b)  Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of our prior period financial statements.     - 21 -     System-Wide Net Sales (Non-GAAP) . System-Wide Net Sales is a non-GAAP measure we use to measure the overall performance of our business across all of our geographies and markets we serve. Our South American Joint Venture is managed as an integral part of our International segment, and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and our BaySaver joint venture are managed as integral parts of our Domestic segment. System-Wide Net Sales is prepared as if our South American Joint Venture, our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, and our BaySaver joint venture (prior to its acquisition on July 17, 2015) were accounted for as consolidated subsidiaries for all periods. The reconciliation of our System-Wide Net Sales to Net sales is as follows:           (a)  As of July 17, 2015, we increased our ownership in BaySaver to 65% and have consolidated BaySaver since that date. As such Net Sales from our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015 are included in this line item.  Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) . Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a non-GAAP, supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance as if all shares held by the ESOP were to be converted to common shares. This information is useful to investors as the preferred shares held by the ESOP are required to be distributed to our employees over time, which is done in the form of common stock after the conversion of the preferred shares. As such, this measure is included in this report because it provides the investors with information to understand the impact on the financial statements once all preferred shares are converted and distributed. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. We calculate Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) by adjusting Net income per share Basic, Net income available to common stockholders   Basic, and Weighted average common shares outstanding   Basic amounts for the conversion of all shares of Redeemable convertible preferred stock into ADS common stock at the conversion ratio of one share of redeemable convertible preferred stock for every 0.7692 share of common stock as of the beginning of each period presented.  To effect this adjustment with respect to Net income available to common stockholders - Basic, we have (1) added back the accretion of Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries, (2) added back the dividends to Redeemable convertible preferred stockholders and dividends paid to unvested restricted stockholders, (3) added back the amount allocated to participating securities under the two class earnings per share computation method, and (4) added back ESOP deferred compensation attributable to the shares of Redeemable convertible preferred stock allocated to employee ESOP accounts during the applicable periods, which is a non-cash      - 22 -     charge to earnings. We have also made adjustments to the Weighted average common shares outstanding   Basic to (1) assume share conversion of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock to common stock and (2) add shares of outstanding unvested restricted stock.  The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP), Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding   Fully Converted (Non-GAAP) and Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) to Net income available to common stockholders - Basic, Weighted average common shares outstanding   Basic and Net income per share - Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures, respectively, for each of the periods indicated.      Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) . Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management and the Company s Board of Directors to assess the Company s ability to generate cash. Management believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow does not include property, plant and equipment purchases completed through financing arrangements. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our measure of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The following table presents a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to Cash flow from operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated.         - 23 -     Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our primary liquidity requirements are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and dividend payments for our convertible preferred stock and common stock. We have historically funded, and expect to continue to fund, our operations primarily through internally generated cash flow, debt financings, equity issuance and capital and operating leases. From time to time, we may explore additional financing methods and other means to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  As of December 31, 2016, we had $6.2 million in cash that was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings in foreign subsidiaries with the exception of cash dividends paid by our ADS Mexicana joint venture. In the event that foreign earnings are repatriated, these amounts will be subject to income tax liabilities in the appropriate tax jurisdictions.  Working Capital and Cash Flows  As of December 31, 2016, we had $199.5 million in liquidity, including $12.1 million of cash, $162.4 million in borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility and $25.0 million under the Senior Notes, described below. We believe that our cash on hand, together with the availability of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and other financing arrangements and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, scheduled interest payments on our indebtedness and the dividend payment requirement for our convertible preferred stock for at least the next twelve months.  Working Capital . Working capital decreased to $178.1 million as of December 31, 2016, from $187.4 million as of March 31, 2016, primarily due to the decreases in account receivable of $32.3 million consistent with the seasonality of our business and a decrease of $7.8 million in inventory for planned sales, offset by a decrease of $38.5 million in accounts payable and other current liabilities. As disclosed in Note 1, the change in working capital is also impacted by the reduction of net current deferred tax assets from $11.7 million as of March 31, 2016 to $0 as of December 31, 2016 as all deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2016 are now classified as non-current as result of the adoption of an accounting standard update.  Operating Cash Flows. Cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 was $116.6 million as compared with cash from operating activities of $129.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015. Cash flows from operating activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by higher net income, offset by decreases in working capital as noted above.  Investing Cash Flows. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash used for investing activities was $41.4 million and $35.4 million, respectively, primarily due to capital expenditures in support of operations. Capital expenditures totaled $36.5 million and $31.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Our capital expenditures for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 were used primarily to support facility expansions, equipment replacements, various recycled resin initiatives and capitalized software.  Financing Cash Flows. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, cash used for financing activities was $69.1 million, due to payments on our Senior Notes, Term loan and capital lease obligations, partially offset by decreased repayments on our Revolving Credit facility. During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $89.8 million, due to repayments of our Revolving Credit, payments of capital lease obligations and proceeds from notes, mortgages and other debt.  Capital Expenditures  We currently anticipate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $50 million to $55 million in fiscal year 2017. Such capital expenditures are expected to be financed using funds generated by operations. As of December 31, 2016,the Company expects to spend $20 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.  Financing Transactions  Bank Term Loans. On September 24, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, or PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June 12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for our Bank Term Loans consisting of (i) the Revolving Credit Facility providing for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $325 million, (ii) the Term Loan Facility providing for the Term Loans in an aggregate original principal amount of $100 million, and (iii) the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility, described below, which is more fully described in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A.      - 24 -     As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding principal drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility was $152.0 million, with $162.4 million available to be drawn on the U.S. facility. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan was $75 million.  ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility . On September 24, 2010, our joint venture ADS Mexicana entered into a credit agreement with PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June 12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $12 million. As of December 31, 2016, there was no outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility and $12 million available to be drawn.  Senior Notes. On December 11, 2009, we entered into a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management Inc., or Prudential, which agreement, as amended and restated on September 24, 2010 and subsequently further amended, provides for the issuance by us of senior secured promissory notes to Prudential or its affiliates from time to time in the aggregate principal amount up to $100 million, which is more fully described in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A. We have $25 million available for issuance of senior notes under the private shelf agreement. At December 31, 2016, the outstanding principal balance on these notes was $75 million.  October and December 2016 Consents Related to the Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes. In October 2016, the Company obtained consents from the lenders of the Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes. These consents had the effect of extending the time for filing of our first quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly financial information to November 30, 2016 and our second quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly financial information to December 31, 2016, whereby an event of default was waived as long as those items are delivered within a 30 day grace period after those dates. In addition, the consents also permitted the Company s payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share on common shares in December 2016, as well as reaffirmed the annual dividend of $0.0195 per share to be paid on shares of preferred stock in March 2017.  In December 2016, the Company obtained additional consents from the lenders of the Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes. These consents had the effect of extending the time for delivery of our first quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly financial information to January 31, 2017.  Covenant Compliance  Our outstanding debt agreements and instruments contain various restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on additional indebtedness and capital distributions, including dividend payments. The two primary debt covenants include a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio maintenance covenant. For any relevant period of determination, the Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Consolidated Indebtedness (funded debt plus guarantees) by Consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit facility. The current upper limit is 4.0 times. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of Consolidated EBITDA minus Capital Expenditures minus cash income taxes paid, by the sum of Fixed Charges. Fixed Charges include cash interest expense, scheduled principal payments on indebtedness, and ESOP capital distributions in excess of $10 million in a given fiscal year. The current minimum ratio is 1.25 times. For further information, see  Note 12. Debt  to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2016, with the exception of the determination in December 2016 that certain intercompany loans between ADS Mexicana and ADS, Inc. had occurred between November 2014 and November 2015 that triggered an event of default according to the terms of the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility. On December 13, 2016, ADS Mexicana obtained a covenant waiver from its lenders.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Excluding the guarantee of 50% of certain debt of our unconsolidated South American Joint Venture, as further discussed in  Note 4. Related Party Transactions  to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangement. As of December 31, 2016, our South American Joint Venture had approximately $16.0 million of outstanding debt. We do not believe that this guarantee will have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  There have been no changes in critical accounting policies from those disclosed in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A.      - 25 -     Forward-Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Form 10-Q ) includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terms such as  believes,   expects,   may,   will,   would,   should,   could,   seeks,   predict,   potential,   continue,   intends,   plans,   projects,   estimates,   anticipates  or other comparable terms.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual consolidated results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and industry development may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, even if our actual consolidated results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and industry development are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in or implied by the forward-looking statements, including those reflected in forward-looking statements relating to our operations and business, the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Form 10-Q (including under the headings  Risk Factors  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ), and those described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those reflected in forward-looking statements relating to our operations and business include:                fluctuations in the price and availability of resins and other raw materials and our ability to pass any increased costs of raw materials on to our customers in a timely manner;                volatility in general business and economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, including without limitation, factors relating to availability of credit, interest rates, fluctuations in capital and business and consumer confidence;                cyclicality and seasonality of the non-residential and residential construction markets and infrastructure spending;                the risks of increasing competition in our existing and future markets, including competition from both manufacturers of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and manufacturers of products using alternative materials;                our ability to continue to convert current demand for concrete, steel and polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) pipe products into demand for our high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and Allied Products;                the effect of weather or seasonality;                the loss of any of our significant customers;                the risks of doing business internationally;                the risks of conducting a portion of our operations through joint ventures;                our ability to expand into new geographic or product markets;                our ability to achieve the acquisition component of our growth strategy;                the risk associated with manufacturing processes;                our ability to manage our assets;                the risks associated with our product warranties;                our ability to manage our supply purchasing and customer credit policies;                the risks associated with our self-insured programs;                our ability to control labor costs and to attract, train and retain highly-qualified employees and key personnel;                our ability to protect our intellectual property rights;                changes in laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations;                our ability to project product mix;                the risks associated with our current levels of indebtedness;                our ability to meet future capital requirements and fund our liquidity needs;                the risk that additional information may arise that would require the Company to make additional adjustments or revisions or to restate further the financial statements and other financial data for certain prior periods and any future periods;                any further delay in the filing of any filings with the SEC;                the review of potential weaknesses or deficiencies in the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, and discovering further weaknesses of which we are not currently aware or which have not been detected; and                additional uncertainties related to accounting issues generally.  All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this report and we do not undertake any obligation, other than as may be required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends, or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.     - 26 -
