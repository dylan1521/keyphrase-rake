    Management's Discussion and Analysis of F inancial Condition and Results of Operations  Unless the context otherwise indicates or requires, as used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms "we," "our," "us," "ADS" and the "Company" refer to Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. and its directly- and indirectly-owned subsidiaries as a combined entity, except where it is clear that the terms mean only Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. exclusive of its subsidiaries.  Our fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, references to "year" pertain to our fiscal year. For example, 2018 refers to fiscal 2018, which is the period from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018.  The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on May 30, 2017. In addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. For more information, see the section below entitled "Forward Looking Statements."  We consolidate all of our joint ventures for purposes of GAAP, except for our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture.  Overview  We are the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the underground construction and infrastructure marketplace. Our innovative products are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform, our overall product breadth and scale and our manufacturing excellence. In the United States, our national footprint combined with our strong local presence and broad product offering make us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $11 billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity.  Our products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following our entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, our pipe products have been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets. This has allowed us to consistently gain share and achieve above-market growth throughout economic cycles. We expect to continue to drive conversion to our products from traditional materials as contractors, civil design engineers and municipal agencies increasingly acknowledge the superior physical attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products. In addition, we believe that overall demand for our products will benefit as the regulatory environment continues to evolve.  Our broad product line includes HDPE pipe, PP pipe and related water management products. Building on our core drainage businesses, we have aggressively pursued attractive ancillary product categories such as storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings and filters, and water quality filters and separators. We refer to these ancillary product categories as Allied Products. Given the scope of our overall sales and distribution platform, we have been able to drive growth within our Allied Products and believe there are significant growth opportunities going forward.  - 21 -       Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.     Results of Operations  Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 Compared With Three Months Ended June 30, 2016  The following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net sales that have been derived from our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. We believe this presentation is useful to investors in comparing historical results.          Net sales - Net sales were $358.4million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, increasing $0.8million, or 0.2%, over the comparable period in fiscal 2017.           Domestic net sales increased $6.7 million, or 2.2%, in the three months ended June 30, 2017, over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. Our domestic pipe sales increased by $2.9 million, or 1.3%, which was a result of pipe volume increase of $4.4 million offset by price decreases and changes in product mix of $2.1 million. Allied Product sales increased $3.9 million, or 4.3%.  International net sales decreased $6.0 million, or 13.3%, in the three months ended June 30, 2017 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily attributable to price decreases and changes in product mix of $2.8 million, pipe volume decreases of $1.5 million and a decrease in Allied Products sales of $1.3 million.  - 22 -       Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.     Cost of goods sold and Gross profit - Cost of goods sold increased by $10.7million, or 4.1%, and gross profit decreased by $9.9million, or 10.2%, in the three months ended June 30, 2017 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year.          The decrease in domestic gross profit of $7.4 million, or 8.4%, was due to a $4.5 million increase in material costs and a $1.4 million increase in labor and overhead costs. These increased expenses were partially offset by gross profit impact of the net sales increase discussed above. The remainder of the variance is comprised of transportation and other expenses.  International gross profit decreased $2.5 million, or 27.8%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, largely due to the gross profit impact of the 13.3% decrease in net sales discussed above and a $0.3 million decrease in labor and overhead costs.  Selling expenses - As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses were 6.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 6.8% in the prior year. The change is primarily due to a benefit in bad debt expense in fiscal 2018 resulting from the collection of approximately $0.6 million from a Canadian customer that had previously been reserved.  General and administrative expenses - General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 decreased $7.8million from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $7.0 million and a decrease in restatement related costs of $7.7 million. These decreases were offset by an increase of $5.1 million in professional fees and an increase of $1.4 million in compensation expense. On April 1, 2017 all stock options were amended and became equity classified. In the three months ended June 30, 2016, all stock options were liability-classified resulting in mark-to-market adjustments.  Loss on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities - In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company shortened the remaining useful life of certain assets related to two manufacturing facilities closing in fiscal 2018 resulting in accelerated depreciation expense of approximately $2million and recorded approximately $0.6 million of severance.  Intangible amortization . Intangible amortization remained relatively flat.  Interest expense . Our interest expense remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales.  Derivative gains and other income, net - Derivative gains and other income, net decreased by $2.1million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The majority of the Company's previous derivative contracts expired during fiscal 2017. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized a net $1.1 million gain on derivative contracts. On June 28, 2017, the company entered into an interest rate swap. The interest rate swap did not have a material impact on the Derivative gains and other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 2017.  Income tax expense - For the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company had effective tax rates of 34.8% and 42.1%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the timing of certain discrete items.  Equity in net (income) loss of unconsolidated affiliates - Equity in net (income) loss of unconsolidated affiliates represents our proportionate share of income or loss attributed to two unconsolidated joint ventures in which we  - 23 -       Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.     have significant influence, but not control, over operations. The Equity in net (income) loss of unconsolidated affiliates changed to a $0.2 million income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from a $0.1 million loss for th e three months ended June 30, 2016. The change is primarily attributable to insurance recovery related to a fire that occurred in fiscal 2017 in the South American Joint Venture.  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest - Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased from net income of $1.1million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 to net income of $0.7million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The change is primarily attributable to fluctuations in the profitability of ADS-Mexicana.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  In addition to financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share and Free Cash Flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.  Adjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, has been presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash charges and certain other expenses.  Adjusted EBITDA is included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because it is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. In addition to covenant compliance and executive performance evaluations, we use adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.  Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure of our financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation, such as stock-based compensation expense, derivative fair value adjustments, and foreign currency transaction losses. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using adjusted EBITDA supplementally. Our measure of adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.  - 24 -       Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.     The following table presents a rec onciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated.               (1)   Includes our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.      (2)   Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with our debt refinancing and asset acquisitions and dispositions.      (3)   Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of our prior period financial statements in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 expenses relate to the ongoing SEC Enforcement Division's investigation and related shareholder litigation.  Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share - Adjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share - Adjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share, Adjusted Net Income and Weighted Average Fully Converted Common Shares Outstanding, which are non-GAAP measures, are supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We calculate Adjusted earnings per fully converted share (Non-GAAP), Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP), and Weighted average fully converted common shares outstanding (Non-GAAP), by adjusting our Net income per share - Basic, Net income available to common stockholders - Basic and Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures. To effect this adjustment with respect to Net income available to common stockholders   Basic, we have (1) removed the adjustment for the change in fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock classified as mezzanine equity, (2) added back the dividends to redeemable convertible preferred stockholders and dividends paid to unvested restricted stockholders, (3) made corresponding adjustments to the amount allocated to participating securities under the two-class earnings per share computation method, (4) added back ESOP deferred compensation attributable to the shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock allocated to employee ESOP accounts during the applicable period, which is a non-cash charge to our earnings and not deductible for income tax purposes, (5) added back the accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries.  We have also made adjustments to the Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic to assume (1) share conversion of the Redeemable convertible preferred stock to outstanding shares of common stock and (2) add shares of outstanding unvested restricted stock.  - 25 -       Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.     Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance on a per share basis assuming all shares held by the ESOP and all shares of redeem able common stock are converted to common stock. This information is useful to investors as the preferred shares held by the ESOP are required to be distributed to our employees over time, which is done in the form of common stock after the conversion of t he preferred shares. As such, this measure is included in this report because it provides the investors with information to understand the impact on the financial statements once all preferred shares are converted and distributed. Adjusted Earnings Per Ful ly Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.  The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP), Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP) and Weighted Average Fully Converted Common Shares Outstanding (Non-GAAP) to Net income (loss) per share - Basic, Net income (loss) available to common stockholders - Basic and Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures, respectively, for each of the periods indicated.     - 26 -       Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.     Free Cash Flow - Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that comprises cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is a measure used by management and the Company's Board of Directors to assess the Company's ability to generate cash. Acco rdingly, free cash flow has been presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as a supplemental measure of liquidity that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP, because management believes that free cash flow provides useful informati on to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures.  Free cash flow is not a GAAP measure of our liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our measure of free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.  The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to Cash flow from operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated.         Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our primary liquidity requirements are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and dividend payments for our convertible preferred stock and common stock. We have historically funded, and expect to continue to fund, our operations primarily through internally generated cash flow, debt financings, equity issuance and capital and operating leases. From time to time, we may explore additional financing methods and other means to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  As of June 30, 2017, we had $4.9 million in cash that was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings in foreign subsidiaries with the exception of cash dividends paid by our ADS Mexicana joint venture. In the event that foreign earnings are repatriated, these amounts will be subject to income tax liabilities in the appropriate tax jurisdictions.  Working Capital and Cash Flows  As of June 30, 2017, we had $319.5 million in liquidity, including $8.7 million of cash, $285.8 million in borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility net of $11.7 million of outstanding letters of credit, and $25.0 million under the Senior Notes, described below. We believe that our cash on hand, together with the availability of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and other financing arrangements and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, scheduled interest payments on our indebtedness and the dividend payment requirement for our convertible preferred stock for at least the next twelve months.  Working Capital - Working capital increased to $267.0million as of June 30, 2017, from $184.8million as of March 31, 2017, primarily due to the increase in account receivable of $46.5million consistent with the seasonality of our business and an increase of $3.8million in inventory for planned sales. Further, the change in working capital is impacted by a decrease of $14.8million attributable to the difference in timing of the payment of accounts payable,a decrease of $10.5 million of current debt obligations maturities related to the refinancing of the Secured Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes Payable, as discussed in "Note 6. Debt," and a decrease of $11.9 million due to the modification of the liability-classified stock-based awards, as further discussed in "Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation."  Operating Cash Flows -  Cash flows from operating activities for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was a use of $16.5 million as compared with cash used by operating activities of $0.1million for the three months ended June 30,  - 27 -       Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.     2016. Cash flows from operating activities during the three m onths ended June 30, 2017 was impacted by the difference in the timing of collection of receivables and the decrease in inventory spending from the comparable period.  Investing Cash Flows - During the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, cash used for investing activities was $18.2million and $12.8million, respectively, primarily due to capital expenditures in support of operations. Capital expenditures totaled $17.9million and $12.6million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Our capital expenditures for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were used primarily to support facility expansions, equipment replacements, various recycled resin initiatives and capitalized software.  Financing Cash Flows - During the three months ended June 30, 2017, cash provided by financing activities was $37.2million, due to increased borrowings on our Senior Notes and Revolving Credit Facility associated with the debt refinancing, which is more fully discussed in "Note 6. Debt," partially offset by increased repayments on our Revolving Credit facility and Term Loan, and $7.9 million of repurchases of our common stock under the stock repurchase program. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, cash provided by financing activities was $16.2million, due to increased borrowings on our Revolving Credit facility to support our typical seasonal demand increase following the winter months.  Capital Expenditures  Capital expenditures totaled $17.9 million and $12.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Our capital expenditures for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were used primarily to support facility expansions, equipment replacements, our recycled resin initiatives and capitalized software.  We currently anticipate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $55 million to $60 million in fiscal year 2018. Such capital expenditures are expected to be financed using funds generated by operations. As of June 30, 2017, there were no material contractual obligations or commitments related to these planned capital expenditures.  Financing Transactions  Secured Bank Term Loans - On September24, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, or PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for our Bank Term Loans consisting of (i)the Revolving Credit Facility providing for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $325million, (ii)the Term Loan Facility providing for the Term Loans in an aggregate original principal amount of $100million, and (iii)the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility, described below, which is more fully described in our Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K. On June 22, 2017, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with PNC, which amends and restates the agreement dated as of June 12, 2013, to provide the Company a $550 million Revolving Credit Facility, which is more fully described in "Note 6. Debt" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding principal drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility was $252.5 million, with $285.8 million available to be drawn on the U.S. facility, net of $11.7 million of outstanding letters of credit.  ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility - On September24, 2010, our joint venture ADS Mexicana entered into a credit agreement with PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $12million. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding principal drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility was $0.5 million, with $11.5million available to be drawn.  Senior Notes - On December11, 2009, we entered into a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management Inc., or Prudential, which agreement, as amended and restated on September24, 2010 and subsequently further amended, provides for the issuance by us of senior secured promissory notes to Prudential or its affiliates from time to time in the aggregate principal amount up to $100million, which is more fully described in our Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K. On June 22, 2017, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Private  - 28 -       Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.     Shelf Agreement with Prud ential, which amends and restates the agreement dated as of September 24, 2010, to provide for the issuance of secured senior notes to Prudential or its affiliates from time to time in the aggregate principal amount of up to $175 million, which is more ful ly described in "Note 6. Debt" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We have $25million available for issuance of senior notes under the private shelf agreement. At June 30, 2017, the outstanding principal balance on these notes was $150mil lion.  Covenant Compliance  Our outstanding debt agreements and instruments contain various restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on additional indebtedness and capital distributions, including dividend payments. The two primary debt covenants of the amended ADS Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Notes include a Leverage Ratio and an Interest Coverage Ratio maintenance covenant. For any relevant period of determination, the Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Consolidated Indebtedness (funded debt plus guarantees) by Consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit facility. The current upper limit is 4.0 times (or 4.25 as of the date of any acquisitions permitted under the amended agreement for which the aggregate consideration is $100.0 million or greater). The Interest Coverage Ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of Consolidated EBITDA by consolidated interest expense. The current minimum ratio is 3.0 times.  The primary debt covenant of the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility is a Leverage Ratio maintenance covenant. For any relevant period of determination, the Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Consolidated Indebtedness (funded debt plus guarantees) by Consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit facility. The current upper limit is 4.0 times.  For further information, see "Note 6. Debt" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and "Note 12. Debt" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of our Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of June 30, 2017.  Contractual Obligations as of June 30, 2017              (1)   On June 22, 2017, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") and Second Amended and Restated Private Shelf Agreement (the "Private Shelf Agreement"). The Credit Agreement matures in June 2022. See "Note 6. Debt" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.      (2)   Based on applicable rates and pricing margins as of June 30, 2017.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Excluding the guarantees of 50% and 49% of certain debt of our unconsolidated South American Joint Venture and Tigre-ADS USA, respectively, as further discussed in "Note 5. Related Party Transactions" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangement. As of June 30, 2017, our South American Joint Venture and Tigre-ADS USA had approximately $15.4 million and $6.5 million, respectively, of outstanding debt. We do not believe that these guarantees will have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  With the exception of the accounting pronouncements adopted during fiscal 2018 discussed in "Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", there have been no changes in critical accounting policies from  - 29 -       Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.     those disclosed in "Management's Discussion and Ana lysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K.
