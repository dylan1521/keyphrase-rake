Item 2.
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Our fiscal year begins on April1 and ends on March31. Unless otherwise noted, references to  year  pertain to our fiscal year. For example, 2016 refers to fiscal 2016, which is the period from April1, 2015 to March31, 2016.  The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere in this report and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. In addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. For more information, see the section below entitled  Forward Looking Statements.   We consolidate all of our joint ventures for purposes of GAAP, except for our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA Joint Venture.  Overview  We are the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the construction and infrastructure marketplace. Our innovative products are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform, our overall product breadth and scale and our manufacturing excellence. In North America, our national footprint combined with our strong local presence and broad product offering makes us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $10.5 billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity.  Our products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following our entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, our pipe has been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets. This has allowed us to consistently gain share and achieve above market growth throughout economic cycles. We expect to continue to drive conversion to our products from traditional products as contractors, civil design engineers and municipal agencies increasingly acknowledge the superior physical attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products. In addition, we believe that overall demand for our products will benefit as the regulatory environment continues to evolve.  Our broad product line includes corrugated high density polyethylene (or  HDPE ) pipe, polypropylene (or  PP ) pipe and related water management products. Building on our core drainage businesses, we have aggressively pursued attractive ancillary product categories such as storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings and filters, and water quality filters and separators. We refer to these ancillary product categories as Allied Products. Given the scope of our overall sales and distribution platform, we have been able to drive growth within our Allied Products and believe there are significant growth opportunities going forward.  Recent Developments  2014 Initial Public Offering ( IPO )  On July 11, 2014, in anticipation of the IPO, we executed a 4.707-for-one split of our common and our preferred stock. The effect of the stock split on outstanding shares and earnings per share has been retroactively applied to all periods presented.  On July 25, 2014, we completed the IPO of our common stock, which resulted in the sale by the Company of 5,289,474 shares of common stock. We received total proceeds from the IPO of $79.1 million after excluding underwriter discounts and commissions of $5.5 million, based upon the price to the public of $16.00 per share. After deducting other offering expenses of $6.9 million, we used the net proceeds of $72.2 million to reduce the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving portion of our credit facility. The common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol  WMS.   On August 22, 2014, an additional 600,000 shares of common stock were sold by certain selling stockholders of the Company as a result of the partial exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option granted by the selling stockholders to the underwriters in connection with the IPO. The shares were sold at the public offering price of $16.00 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of such additional shares.     - 20 -     2014 Secondary Public Offering ( Secondary Public Offering )  On December 9, 2014, we completed a Secondary Public Offering of our common stock, which resulted in the sale of 10,000,000 shares of common stock by a certain selling stockholder of the Company at a public offering price of $21.25 per share. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholder.  On December 15, 2014, an additional 1,500,000 shares of common stock were sold by a certain selling stockholder of the Company as a result of the full exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option granted by the selling stockholder to the underwriters in connection with the Secondary Public Offering. The shares were sold at the public offering price of $21.25 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of such additional shares.  Acquisition of Ideal Pipe  On January 30, 2015, Hancor of Canada, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired all issued and outstanding shares of Ideal Drain Tile Limited and Wave Plastics Inc., the sole partners of Ideal Pipe (together  Ideal Pipe ) for a contractual purchase price of $55.7 million Canadian dollars, financed through our existing line of credit facility. Ideal Pipe designs, manufactures and markets high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and related water management products used across a broad range of Canadian end markets and applications, including nonresidential, residential, agriculture, and infrastructure applications. The acquisition further strengthens our positions in Canada by increasing our size and scale in the market, as well as enhancing our manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities. The results of operations of Ideal Pipe are included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations after January 30, 2015.  Acquisition of BaySaver  On July 17, 2015, ADS Ventures, Inc. ( ADS/V ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired an additional 10% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in BaySaver, for a purchase price of $3.2 million, subject to certain post-closing purchase price payments, which was financed through our existing line of credit facility. The BaySaver joint venture was established in July 2013 to design, engineer, manufacture, market and sell water quality filters and separators used in the removal of sediment and pollution from storm water anywhere in the world except New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. The Company originally contributed $3.5 million in cash, $1.3 million in inventory, and intangible assets with no carrying value, in exchange for a 55% equity interest and a 50% voting interest in BaySaver. Concurrent with the additional investment in July 2015, we also entered into an amendment to the BaySaver joint venture agreement to modify the voting rights for the joint venture from an equal vote for each member to a vote based upon the ownership interest. As a result, the Company increased its ownership interest in BaySaver to 65% and obtained the majority of the voting rights.  While we had previously accounted for our investment in BaySaver under the equity method of accounting, we have concluded that the additional investment results in a step acquisition of BaySaver that will be treated as a business combination. As a result, our condensed consolidated financial statements include the consolidation of BaySaver s financial statements beginning on July 17, 2015. The accounting for the step acquisition resulted in the Company recognizing a loss of $0.5 million in the period of acquisition due to the remeasurement to fair value of our prior equity interest, which is included in Derivative losses and other expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Results of Operations  Three Months Ended December31, 2015 Compared With Three Months Ended December31, 2014  The following tables summarize certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Also included is certain information relating to the operating results as a percentage of net sales.         - 21 -           (a)  See section entitled  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  for further information.    *  not meaningful  Net sales      Net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 totaled $312.8 million, increasing $32.9 million, or 11.8%, over the comparable prior year period.  Domestic net sales increased $27.6 million, or 11.5%, for the third quarter ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase in domestic sales was due to continued growth in the non-residential, residential and infrastructure markets and a modest increase in agricultural sales. All domestic end markets also benefitted from mild winter weather at the end of the quarter. Of the $27.6 million in sales growth, the breakdown between our Pipe and Allied Products reflected increases of $16.2 million and $11.4 million, respectively. Pipe sales were helped by a volume increase of 12.2% compared to the comparable period in the prior year, offset by a decrease in Pipe selling prices of 2.9% compared to the comparable prior year period. Allied Product sales increased 19.2% which included the addition of $3.3 million in sales from the acquisition of BaySaver as well as strong gains in our StormTech, Fittings, and Nyloplast product lines.  International net sales for the third quarter ended December 31, 2015 increased $5.4 million, or 13.3%, over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. The growth was primarily due to increased sales in Canada of $11.5 million as a result of the Ideal Pipe acquisition, offsetting soft sales performance in Mexico which declined by $5.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Slower public spending was the main factor for the decline in third quarter net sales in Mexico versus the comparable prior year period. In addition, the Canadian dollar was approximately 15% weaker against the U.S. dollar in the three month period ended December 31, 2015, compared to the three month period ended December 31, 2014, which had a negative impact on Net sales for Canada of $5.0 million during the three month period ended December 31, 2015.     - 22 -     System-Wide Net Sales for the third quarter ended December 31, 2015 were $330.9 million, a net increase of $29.5 million, or 9.8%, over System-Wide Net Sales of $301.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Net sales at our South American Joint Venture operation were down $1.4 million or 9.3% over the comparable prior year period. This decrease was offset by an increase in net sales at our domestic joint venture, Tigre-ADS USA, of $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31 2015, as compared to the prior fiscal year period. The company acquired a controlling interest in BaySaver during the second fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2016 and those sales are now included in the Company s consolidated net sales. During the comparable fiscal year 2015 period BaySaver contributed $2.9 million in sales.  Cost of goods sold and Gross profit  Cost of Goods Sold increased $8.8 million or 3.8% to $239.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $230.7 million over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period.  Gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2015 increased $24.1 million or 49.1% over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales totaled 23.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 17.6% for the comparable fiscal year 2015 period.  Domestic gross profit increased $23.1 million, or 55.5%, to $64.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $41.8 million during the comparable prior year period. In addition to the impact of the 11.5% increase in domestic net sales over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period, the increase was driven by a reduction of 14.0% in the cost of pipe resin used in products sold during the quarter versus the comparable prior year period. Both virgin and non-virgin resin prices continued to decline during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Freight costs totaled 9.7% of domestic net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2015, compared to 9.5% for the prior year period. The higher costs relate to increased depreciation charges associated with new tractors and trailers added to the delivery fleet which offset the benefit of diesel fuel prices moving lower throughout the quarter. Diesel prices declined approximately 30.0% compared to the prior year period.  International gross profit increased $1.0 million, or 13.0%, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. This was the result of the impact of the 13.3% increase in international net sales. Gross profit margins were negatively impacted by the continued devaluation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar as revenue from our Canadian subsidiaries is transacted in the Canadian dollar whereas the cost of raw material is substantially transacted in U.S. dollars.  Selling expenses  Selling expenses consist of field selling and customer service expenditures for personnel engaged in sales and sales support functions. Field selling and customer service expenditures primarily consists of personnel costs (salaries, benefits, and variable sales commissions), travel and entertainment expenses, marketing, promotion, and advertising expenses, as well as bad debt provisions.  Selling expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2015 increased $2.0 million, or 9.9%, over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. The increase was primarily the result of increases in variable selling expenses due to higher sales volume and investments in additional sales coverage and growth initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses decreased slightly to 7.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to 7.1% for the comparable prior year period.  General and administrative expenses  General and administrative expenses consists of personnel costs (salaries, benefits, and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation), recruitment and relocation expenses, accounting and legal fees, business travel expenses, rent and utilities for the administrative offices, director fees, investor relations, membership fees, office supplies, insurance and other miscellaneous expenses.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2015 increased $11.7 million, or 82.6%, over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. The large increase was related in part to incremental expenses for audit, tax, legal and other professional fees which amounted to $7.6 million related to the restatement of our previously filed financial statements as part of the preparation of our Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. There were no comparable amounts in the fiscal year 2015 period. In addition, salaries and compensation expense increased by $1.8 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 and there was an additional $0.6 million in general and administrative expense from the acquisition of the Ideal and BaySaver businesses, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $0.8 million during the period. The remaining increase related to higher corporate overhead including higher depreciation expense as well as increased legal and administrative costs associated with being a public company. Overall, general and administrative expenses amounted to 8.2% of net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2015 compared to 5.0% for the comparable prior year period.     - 23 -     Gain (loss) on disposal of assets or businesses  Gain (loss) on disposal of assets for the three months ended December 31, 2014 changed from a loss of $0.2 million to a gain of $0.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. We did not dispose of any businesses during the three months ended December 31, 2015 or 2014.  Intangible amortization  Intangible amortization for the three months ended December 31, 2015 decreased $0.1 million, or 6.3%, over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period as a result of intangible assets of $7.8 million becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015 offset by the additional amortization for the Ideal Pipe intangible assets acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the BaySaver intangible assets acquired in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.  Interest expense  Interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2015 decreased slightly, $0.1 million, or 2.0%, over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. The modest decrease in the current year third quarter was due to lower average interest rates on our outstanding indebtedness. Average debt outstanding was up only slightly compared to the prior year period, which modestly offset the impact of slightly lower rates.  Derivative losses and other expense, net  Derivative losses and other expense, net decreased $3.0 million over the comparable prior year period as a result of changes in both realized and unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities. The net derivative expense activity for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was $2.4 million (realized loss of $4.1 million less unrealized gain of $1.8 million). This compares to a net derivative expense of $6.5 million incurred during the comparable prior year period (realized loss of $0.4 million and an unrealized loss of $6.1 million). The balance of the change relates primarily to foreign currency transaction gains and other insignificant gains or losses.  Income tax expense  For the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $8.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively. These provisions represent an effective tax rate of 48.2% and 139.5%, respectively. Income before income taxes increased significantly compared to the prior year resulting in a much higher provision for income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2015 is lower than the prior year period primarily due to the shift in the projections of the proportion of income earned and higher income before income taxes reducing the impact of non-deductible items in our tax calculations.  Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates  Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $0.1 million from $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015.  Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interest  Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the share of ADS Mexicana and BaySaver net income attributable to the minority interest holders. Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interest changed from income of $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014 to a loss of $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. The change is largely due to losses incurred by ADS Mexicana of $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 compared to income of $1.4 million for the prior fiscal year 2015 period. The balance of the change relates to activity for BaySaver.     - 24 -     Net loss attributable to ADS and Net loss per share  Third quarter net income attributable to ADS for fiscal year 2016 was $8.0 million, improving from fiscal year 2015 third quarter s net loss attributable to ADS of $3.3 million, as influenced by the factors noted above. Net income per share for the third quarter fiscal year 2016 totaled $0.13 per basic and $0.12 per diluted share, as compared to a loss of $0.07 per basic and diluted share recorded in the comparable prior year period.  Adjusted EBITDA(a)           (a)  See section entitled  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  for further information.  Nine Months Ended December31, 2015 Compared With Nine Months Ended December31, 2014  The following tables summarize certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Also included is certain information relating to the operating results as a percentage of net sales.           (a)  See section entitled  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  for further information.     - 25 -     Net sales      Net sales totaled $1,045.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, increasing $72.3 million, or 7.4%, over the comparable period for fiscal year 2015. The total sales growth when broken down between our Pipe and Allied Products, reflected increases of $36.4 million or 4.9% and $35.9 million or 15.4%, respectively, for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year period.  Domestic net sales increased $43.6 million, or 5.1%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year period. Domestic pipe sales increased $17.3 million, or 2.7%, due to continued growth in our N-12 HDPE and High Performance PP product lines offsetting lower agricultural sales. Allied Product sales increased $26.3 million, or 12.5%, due to strong sales volume sold primarily into the non-residential, residential and infrastructure markets. In addition, approximately $6.8 million of the total Allied Product sales increase relates to the acquisition of BaySaver during the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2016.  International net sales increased $28.7 million, or 23.0%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. The growth was primarily due to increased sales in Canada, including in particular the contribution from the acquisition of Ideal Pipe, which increased sales by approximately $36.8 million, helping to offset decreased sales in Mexico of $3.5 million. In addition, the Canadian dollar was approximately 14% weaker against the U.S. dollar in the nine month period ended December 31, 2015, compared to the nine month period ended December 31, 2014, which had a negative impact on Net sales for Canada of $15.6 million during the nine month period ended December 31, 2015.  System-Wide Net Sales were $1,103.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2016, an increase of $65.0 million, or 6.3%, over System-Wide Net Sales of $1,038.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2015. Net sales at our South American Joint Venture operation were negatively impacted by continued softness in the mining markets and an overall construction slowdown due to reduced public spending resulting in a sales decline of $4.4 million or 9.6% to $41.3 million. Net sales at our domestic joint ventures, Tigre-ADS USA and BaySaver, provided combined net sales for unconsolidated joint ventures of $16.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, down $2.8 million when compared to the prior fiscal year period. However, when taking into consideration the $6.8 million in net sales recognized for BaySaver subsequent to the July 2015 acquisition of the controlling interest, comparable sales are up $4.0 million or 20.5%.  Cost of goods sold and Gross profit  Cost of Goods Sold increased $22.4 million or 2.8% for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 compared with the same period during fiscal year 2015.  Gross profit increased $49.8 million or 27.7% from $179.8 million to $229.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 compared with the same period in the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales totaled 22.0% for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 18.5% for the prior year.     - 26 -     Domestic gross profit increased $36.7 million, or 22.7%, to $198.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $161.4 million during the prior year period. In addition to the impact of the 5.1% increase in domestic net sales over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period, the increase was also driven by a reduction in raw material costs of approximately 8.4%, particularly pipe resin costs. Raw material prices were flat in the first quarter and then declined in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year periods. Freight costs totaled 9.6% of domestic net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, compared to 9.3% for the prior year period. Diesel prices began to moderate after the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 and continued to decline throughout fiscal 2016. The higher costs relate to increased depreciation charges associated with new tractors and trailers added to the delivery fleet, which offset the benefit of diesel fuel prices moving lower throughout the quarter. Diesel prices were approximately 31.0% below the prior fiscal year for the nine-month period.  International gross profit increased $13.2 million, or 71.6%, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2016 over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. This was the result of the impact of a 23.0% increase in international net sales. Gross profit was also helped by improved gross profit performance in Mexico for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, as Mexico benefitted from lower resin costs.  Selling expenses  Selling expenses consist of field selling and customer service for personnel engaged in sales and sales support functions. Field selling and customer service expenditures primarily consists of personnel costs (salaries, benefits, and variable sales commissions), travel and entertainment expenses, marketing, promotion, and advertising expenses, as well as bad debt provisions.  Selling expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 increased $6.0 million, or 10.0%, over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period, growing at a higher rate than the change in net sales. The increase was primarily the result of increases in selling expenses related to Ideal Pipe and BaySaver, variable selling expenses due to higher sales volume and investments in additional sales coverage and growth initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses increased slightly to 6.3% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to 6.1% for the comparable prior year period.  General and administrative expenses  General and administrative expenses consists of personnel costs (salaries, benefits, and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation), recruitment and relocation expenses, accounting and legal fees, business travel expenses, rent and utilities for the administrative offices, director fees, investor relations, membership fees, office supplies, insurance and other miscellaneous expenses.  General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 increased $25.4 million, or 58.2%, over the comparable 2015 fiscal year period. The increase was primarily the result of significant increases in professional fees for accounting, audit, tax, legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of our previously filed financial statements as part of the preparation of our Fiscal 2015 Form10-K. There were no such amounts in the comparable fiscal 2015 period. These fees amounted to approximately $16.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015. There was also an increase in salary and compensation expenses of $2.2 million, as well as incremental general and administrative expenses related to the Ideal Pipe and BaySaver acquisitions of $1.4 million. The remaining increase related to higher corporate overhead including higher depreciation expense as well as increased legal and administrative costs associated with being a public company. Overall, general and administrative expenses amounted to 6.6% of net sales compared to 4.5% in the prior year.  Loss on disposal of assets or businesses  Loss on the disposal of assets or businesses for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was not significant for either period, amounting to losses of $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively.     - 27 -     Intangible amortization  Intangible amortization for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 decreased $0.6 million, or 6.6%, over the comparable prior year period as a result of intangible assets of $7.8 million becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015, offset by the additional amortization for the Ideal Pipe intangible assets acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the BaySaver intangible assets acquired in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.  Interest expense  Interest expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 decreased $0.7 million, or 5.2%, over the comparable prior year period. The decrease was due to both slightly lower average interest rates on our outstanding Revolving Credit Facility, most of which is based on LIBOR, in addition to a modestly lower average outstanding debt balance over the nine-month period. For the prior period ended December 31, 2014, the Company carried a higher Revolving Credit Facility balance through July 2014 until the IPO proceeds were used to reduce the Revolving Credit Facility balance. Additionally, during the nine-month period ending December 31, 2014, a 2% surcharge on our Senior Notes was incurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 due to our leverage ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Funded Debt exceeding three times at June 30, 2014. The surcharge increased interest expense by $0.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, and there was no such amount incurred in fiscal year 2016.  Derivative losses and other expense, net  Derivative losses and other expense, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 increased $13.2 million over the comparable prior year period. The increase in expense is predominantly a result of both realized and unrealized losses on hedging activities. The hedging losses for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 were $18.4 million comprised of realized losses on cash settlements of $10.6 million and unrealized losses on mark-to-market adjustments of $7.8 million. This compares to a net hedging loss of $6.6 million incurred during the prior nine month period, consisting of realized losses on cash settlements of $0.4 million and unrealized losses of $6.2 million on the unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments. In addition to the hedging losses, the Company realized a loss of $0.5 million upon completing the acquisition of BaySaver as a result of remeasuring our investment as of the July 17, 2015 step acquisition. See  Note 2. Acquisitions.  The balance of the change relates primarily to foreign currency transaction activity and other insignificant gains or losses.  Income tax expense  For the nine months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded income tax provisions of $19.8 million and $20.2 million, respectively, which represent an effective tax rate of 36.2% and 41.8%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of the fiscal 2016 is lower than the prior year period primarily due to the shift in the projections of the proportion of income earned and higher income before income taxes reducing the impact of non-deductible items in our tax calculations.  Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates  Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates represent our proportionate share of net loss attributed to the two unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have significant influence, but not control, over operations as well as our proportional share of BaySaver earnings up until the July 17, 2015 step acquisition. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 decreased $0.8 million over the comparable prior fiscal year period to a net loss of $0.9 million compared to a net loss of $1.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower net losses generated by the South American Joint Venture which reduced our share of the losses during the nine-months ended December 31, 2015 to $1.2 million compared to $2.0 million for the comparable prior year period.  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents income attributable to the noncontrolling interest holders in joint venture operations that are consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased $0.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 to $4.5 million compared to $4.4 million for the comparable prior year period. As noted above, the 35.0% noncontrolling interest for BaySaver is now included in the fiscal 2016 results beginning after July 17, 2015.     - 28 -     Net income attributable to ADS and Net income per share  Net income attributable to ADS of $29.6 million increased from the preceding fiscal year s net income attributable to ADS of $22.1 million, as influenced by the factors noted above. Net income per share for the first nine months of fiscal year 2016 totaled $0.48 and $0.46 per basic and diluted per share, respectively, as compared to net income per share of $0.19 per basic and diluted share recorded in the comparable prior year period. The net income per share for the nine months ended December 31, 2014 was impacted by changes in fair value appreciation of Redeemable convertible preferred stock classified in mezzanine equity which reduced income available to common stockholders by $11.1 million, or $0.22 per share for common stockholders.  Adjusted EBITDA (a)           (a)  See section entitled  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  for further information.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  In addition to financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, System-Wide Net Sales and Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.  Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is comprised of net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, non-cash charges and certain other expenses. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance and evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors.  The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:         - 29 -           (a)  Includes our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In addition, these amounts include our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our BaySaver joint venture prior to our acquisition of BaySaver on July 17, 2015, which was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting.    (b)  Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of our prior period financial statements as reflected in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K.    (c)  Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with our secondary public offering in fiscal year 2015.  Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income  The following table presents a reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:           (a)  Includes our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In addition, these amounts include our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our BaySaver joint venture prior to our acquisition of BaySaver on July 17, 2015, which was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting.    (b)  Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of our prior period financial statements as reflected in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K.    (c)  Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with our IPO and secondary public offering in fiscal year 2015.     - 30 -              (a)  Includes our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In addition, these amounts include our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our BaySaver joint venture prior to our acquisition of BaySaver on July 17, 2015, which was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting.    (b)  Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of our prior period financial statements as reflected in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K.    (c)  Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with our IPO and secondary public offering in fiscal year 2015.  System-Wide Net Sales . System-Wide Net Sales is a non-GAAP measure which equals the sum of the net sales of our domestic and international segments plus all net sales from our unconsolidated joint ventures. We participated in three unconsolidated joint ventures during the nine months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014; the South American Joint Venture, Tigre-ADS USA, Inc. ( Tigre-ADS USA , which is 49% owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary ADS/V), and BaySaver prior to July 17, 2015. We use this metric to measure the overall performance of our business across all of our geographies and markets we serve.  Our South American Joint Venture is managed as an integral part of our international segment, and our Tigre-ADS USA and BaySaver joint ventures are managed as an integral part of our domestic segment. However, they are not consolidated under GAAP, with the exception of our BaySaver joint venture which we have consolidated since we acquired a controlling interest on July 17, 2015. System-Wide Net Sales is prepared as if our South American Joint Venture, our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, and our BaySaver joint venture were accounted for as consolidated subsidiaries for all periods.  The reconciliation of our System-Wide Net Sales to Net sales is as follows:           (a)  On July 31, 2009, we entered into an arrangement to form our South American Joint Venture.     - 31 -       (b)  On July 15, 2013, we entered into an arrangement to form our BaySaver joint venture. As of July 17, 2015, we increased our ownership to 65%, and have consolidated BaySaver since that date. As such, Net Sales from our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015 are included in this line item.    (c)  On April 7, 2014, we entered into an arrangement to form our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture.  Adjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share . Adjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share is a non-GAAP measure and is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We calculate Adjusted earnings per fully converted share (Non-GAAP) by adjusting our Net income per share Basic and Weighted average common shares outstanding   Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures.  To effect this adjustment, we have (1) removed the accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest, (2) removed the adjustment for the change in fair value of Redeemable convertible preferred stock classified as mezzanine equity from the numerator of the Net income per share Basic computation, (3) added back the dividends to Redeemable convertible preferred stockholders and dividends paid to unvested restricted stockholders, (4) made corresponding adjustments to the amount allocated to participating securities under the two-class earnings per share computation method, and (5) added back ESOP deferred compensation attributable to the shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock allocated to employee ESOP accounts during the applicable period, which is a non-cash charge to our earnings and not deductible for income tax purposes.  We have also made adjustments to the Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic to assume, (1) share conversion of the Redeemable convertible preferred stock to outstanding shares of common stock and (2) add shares of outstanding unvested restricted stock.  Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is included in this report because it is a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.  The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) to our Net Income attributable to ADS, Net income per share and corresponding Weighted average common shares outstanding amounts, the most comparable GAAP measures, for each of the periods indicated.         - 32 -     Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our primary liquidity requirements are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, and dividend payments for our convertible preferred stock and common stock. We have historically funded, and expect to continue to fund, our operation primarily through internally generated cash flow, debt financings and equity issuances. From time to time we may explore additional financing methods and other means to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  As of December 31, 2015, we had $5.2 million in cash that was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to reinvest our earnings in foreign subsidiaries. In the event that foreign earnings are repatriated, these amounts will be subject to income tax liabilities in the appropriate tax jurisdiction. No restrictions exist on our liquidity that is impacted by the significance of cash held by foreign subsidiaries.  Working Capital and Cash Flows  During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, our net increase in cash amounted to $2.8 million, compared to a net increase of $6.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2014. During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, our source of funds was primarily driven by higher operating earnings and a decrease in inventory of $65.7 million. For the same period ending December 31, 2015, our use of cash was primarily driven by increased accounts receivable balances (up $17.5 million), decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities including accrued income taxes ($14.9 million), capital expenditures ($30.0 million), payments on capital lease obligations ($14.9 million), the acquisition of an additional 10% interest in BaySaver and repayment of $62.5 million of Long Term Debt.  During the nine months ended December 31, 2014, our source of funds was primarily driven by higher operating earnings, proceeds of $79.1 million from our IPO of common stock and increased non-cash charges (ESOP and stock-based compensation expense and mark-to-market adjustments for changes in fair value of derivative contracts) and a decrease in inventory of $40.1 million. For the same period ending December 31, 2014, our increased use of cash was primarily driven by increased accounts receivable balances (up $12.8 million), decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities including accrued income taxes ($17.8 million), spending for capital expenditures ($21.3 million), payments on capital lease obligations ($6.6 million), investments in joint ventures ($7.6 million) and repayment of $115.6 million of Long Term Debt.  As of December 31, 2015, we had $182.9 million in liquidity, including $6.4 million of cash and $176.5 million in borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility, described below. We believe that our cash on hand, together with the availability of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and other financing arrangements and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, scheduled interest payments on our indebtedness and dividend payment requirement for our convertible preferred stock for at least the next twelve months.  As of December 31, 2015, we had consolidated indebtedness (excluding lease obligations) of approximately $337.4 million, down $62.5 million compared to March 31, 2015. We repaid a portion of our outstanding indebtedness with operating cash flow.  The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:      Working Capital  Net working capital decreased from $249.2 million as of March 31, 2015, to $190.8 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to the decline in inventory of $65.7 million resulting primarily from a seasonal decrease in the cost of raw material resins on hand at December 31, 2015, and an increase in the current maturities of debt and capital lease obligations of $28.9 million, offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $17.5 million due to sales increases and a $14.9 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and accrued income taxes.     - 33 -     Operating Cash Flows  During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, cash provided from operating activities was $129.4 million as compared with $90.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2014. Cash flow from operating activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2015 was impacted by higher net income, increased depreciation and amortization, and decreased inventory balances, offsetting the use of cash related to changes in receivables accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2014 was impacted by moderately higher net income, share-based compensation, inventory and accounts payable compared to the prior period, offsetting an increase in the use of cash related to changes in accounts receivable and other accrued liabilities, including accrued income taxes.  Investing Cash Flows  During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, cash used for investing activities was $35.4 million, primarily due to $30.0 million for capital expenditures, $1.5 million for software in support of operations, and a $3.2 million investment in an additional 10% of the membership interests in BaySaver.  During the nine months ended December 31, 2014, cash used for investing activities was $29.4 million, primarily due to $21.3 million for capital expenditures in support of operations, a $3.6 million investment in a domestic joint venture operation created in the first quarter fiscal 2015, and a $4.0 million investment in our international joint venture operation to support growth initiatives.  Financing Cash Flows  During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, cash used for financing activities was $89.8 million, primarily due to utilizing our operating cash flow to pay down debt of $62.5 million as well as payments of $14.9 million for lease obligations and $12.7 million for dividends.  During the nine months ended December 31, 2014, cash used for financing activities was $53.6 million, primarily due to utilizing our operating cash flow and $79.1 million of proceeds from the IPO to pay down debt of $115.6 million as well as payments for $6.6 million for lease obligations, $4.3 million in dividends, and $6.5 million for fees related to the IPO.  Capital Expenditures  Capital expenditures totaled $30.0 million and $21.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our capital expenditures for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 were used primarily to support facility expansions, equipment replacements, and our recycled resin initiatives.  We currently anticipate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $45 million in fiscal year 2016. Such capital expenditures are expected to be financed using funds generated by operations. As of December 31, 2015, there were no material contractual obligations or commitments related to these planned capital expenditures.  Financing Transactions  Bank Term Loans  On September 24, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, or PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June 12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for our Bank Term Loans consisting of (i) the Revolving Credit Facility providing for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million, (ii) the Term Loan Facility providing for the Term Loans in an aggregate original principal amount of $100.0 million, and (iii) the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility, described below. The Bank Term Loans also permit us to add additional commitments to the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility not to exceed $50 million in the aggregate. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility are primarily used to provide for our ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs, to finance acquisitions and distributions, and for our other general corporate purposes. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were primarily used for our general corporate purposes. The interest rates on the Bank Term Loans are determined by certain base rates or LIBOR rates, plus an applicable margin. The obligations under the Bank Term Loans are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our personal property assets. On December 20, 2013, we amended the Revolving Credit Facility to, among other terms, make certain amendments in order to permit the payment of a cash dividend.

The Company has satisfied the amended reporting requirements.  Senior Notes  On December 11, 2009, we entered into a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management Inc., or Prudential, which agreement, as amended and restated on September 24, 2010 and subsequently further amended, provides for the issuance by us of senior secured promissory notes to Prudential or its affiliates from time to time in the aggregate principal amount up to $100.0 million.

On July 24, 2013, we issued $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 4.05% Senior Series B Notes due September 24, 2019 for our general corporate purposes. The Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets. On December 20, 2013, we amended the private shelf agreement to, among other things, make certain amendments in order to permit the payment of a cash dividend. For further information about the Senior Notes, see  Note 12. Debt  to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in  Item 8.

The Company has satisfied the amended reporting requirements.  Covenant Compliance  Our outstanding debt agreements and instruments contain various restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on additional indebtedness and capital distributions, including dividend payments. The two primary debt covenants include a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Ratio. For any relevant period of determination, the Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Consolidated Indebtedness (funded debt plus guarantees) by Consolidated EBITDA. The current upper limit is 4.0 times. The Fixed Charge Ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of Consolidated EBITDA minus Capital Expenditures minus cash Income Taxes paid, by the sum of Fixed Charges. Fixed Charges include cash Interest expense, scheduled principal payments on Indebtedness, and ESOP Capital Distributions in excess of $10.0 million in a given fiscal year. The current minimum ratio is 1.25 times. For further information, see  Note 12. Debt  to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of our Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2015.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, with the exception of the guarantee of 50% of certain debt of our unconsolidated South American Joint Venture, as further discussed in  Note 6. Related Party Transactions  of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2015, our South American Joint Venture had approximately $13.7 million of outstanding debt. We do not believe that this guarantee will have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.     - 35 -     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  There have been no changes in critical accounting policies from those disclosed in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K.
