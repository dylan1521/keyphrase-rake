Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our fiscal year begins on April1 and ends on March31. Unless otherwise noted, references to year pertain to our fiscal year. For example, 2016 refers to fiscal 2016, which is the period from April1, 2015 to March31, 2016. The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere in this report and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. In addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. For more information, see the section below entitled Forward Looking Statements. We consolidate all of our joint ventures for purposes of GAAP, except for our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA Joint Venture. Overview We are the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the construction and infrastructure marketplace. Our innovative products are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform, our overall product breadth and scale and our manufacturing excellence. In North America, our national footprint combined with our strong local presence and broad product offering makes us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $10.5 billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity. Our products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following our entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, our pipe has been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets. This has allowed us to consistently gain share and achieve above market growth throughout economic cycles. We expect to continue to drive conversion to our products from traditional products as contractors, civil design engineers and municipal agencies increasingly acknowledge the superior physical attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products. In addition, we believe that overall demand for our products will benefit as the regulatory environment continues to evolve. Our broad product line includes corrugated high density polyethylene (or HDPE ) pipe, polypropylene (or PP ) pipe and related water management products. Building on our core drainage businesses, we have aggressively pursued attractive ancillary product categories such as storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings and filters, and water quality filters and separators. We refer to these ancillary product categories as Allied Products. Given the scope of our overall sales and distribution platform, we have been able to drive growth within our Allied Products and believe there are significant growth opportunities going forward. Recent Developments 2014 Initial Public Offering ( IPO ) On July 11, 2014, in anticipation of the IPO, we executed a 4.707-for-one split of our common and our preferred stock. The effect of the stock split on outstanding shares and earnings per share has been retroactively applied to all periods presented. On July 25, 2014, we completed the IPO of our common stock, which resulted in the sale by the Company of 5,289,474 shares of common stock. We received total proceeds from the IPO of $79.1 million after excluding underwriter discounts and commissions of $5.5 million, based upon the price to the public of $16.00 per share. After deducting other offering expenses of $6.9 million, we used the net proceeds of $72.2 million to reduce the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving portion of our credit facility. The common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol WMS. On August 22, 2014, an additional 600,000 shares of common stock were sold by certain selling stockholders of the Company as a result of the partial exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option granted by the selling stockholders to the underwriters in connection with the IPO. The shares were sold at the public offering price of $16.00 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of such additional shares. - 20 - 2014 Secondary Public Offering ( Secondary Public Offering ) On December 9, 2014, we completed a Secondary Public Offering of our common stock, which resulted in the sale of 10,000,000 shares of common stock by a certain selling stockholder of the Company at a public offering price of $21.25 per share. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholder. On December 15, 2014, an additional 1,500,000 shares of common stock were sold by a certain selling stockholder of the Company as a result of the full exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option granted by the selling stockholder to the underwriters in connection with the Secondary Public Offering. The shares were sold at the public offering price of $21.25 per share. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of such additional shares. Acquisition of Ideal Pipe On January 30, 2015, Hancor of Canada, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired all issued and outstanding shares of Ideal Drain Tile Limited and Wave Plastics Inc., the sole partners of Ideal Pipe (together Ideal Pipe ) for a contractual purchase price of $55.7 million Canadian dollars, financed through our existing line of credit facility. Ideal Pipe designs, manufactures and markets high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and related water management products used across a broad range of Canadian end markets and applications, including nonresidential, residential, agriculture, and infrastructure applications. The acquisition further strengthens our positions in Canada by increasing our size and scale in the market, as well as enhancing our manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities. The results of operations of Ideal Pipe are included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations after January 30, 2015. Acquisition of BaySaver On July 17, 2015, ADS Ventures, Inc. ( ADS/V ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired an additional 10% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in BaySaver, for a purchase price of $3.2 million, subject to certain post-closing purchase price payments, which was financed through our existing line of credit facility. The BaySaver joint venture was established in July 2013 to design, engineer, manufacture, market and sell water quality filters and separators used in the removal of sediment and pollution from storm water anywhere in the world except New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. The Company originally contributed $3.5 million in cash, $1.3 million in inventory, and intangible assets with no carrying value, in exchange for a 55% equity interest and a 50% voting interest in BaySaver. Concurrent with the additional investment in July 2015, we also entered into an amendment to the BaySaver joint venture agreement to modify the voting rights for the joint venture from an equal vote for each member to a vote based upon the ownership interest. As a result, the Company increased its ownership interest in BaySaver to 65% and obtained the majority of the voting rights. While we had previously accounted for our investment in BaySaver under the equity method of accounting, we have concluded that the additional investment results in a step acquisition of BaySaver that will be treated as a business combination. As a result, our condensed consolidated financial statements include the consolidation of BaySaver s financial statements beginning on July 17, 2015. The accounting for the step acquisition resulted in the Company recognizing a loss of $0.5 million in the period of acquisition due to the remeasurement to fair value of our prior equity interest, which is included in Derivative losses and other expense, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Results of Operations Three Months Ended December31, 2015 Compared With Three Months Ended December31, 2014 The following tables summarize certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Also included is certain information relating to the operating results as a percentage of net sales. - 21 - (a) See section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information. * not meaningful Net sales Net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 totaled $312.8 million, increasing $32.9 million, or 11.8%, over the comparable prior year period. Domestic net sales increased $27.6 million, or 11.5%, for the third quarter ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase in domestic sales was due to continued growth in the non-residential, residential and infrastructure markets and a modest increase in agricultural sales. All domestic end markets also benefitted from mild winter weather at the end of the quarter. Of the $27.6 million in sales growth, the breakdown between our Pipe and Allied Products reflected increases of $16.2 million and $11.4 million, respectively. Pipe sales were helped by a volume increase of 12.2% compared to the comparable period in the prior year, offset by a decrease in Pipe selling prices of 2.9% compared to the comparable prior year period. Allied Product sales increased 19.2% which included the addition of $3.3 million in sales from the acquisition of BaySaver as well as strong gains in our StormTech, Fittings, and Nyloplast product lines. International net sales for the third quarter ended December 31, 2015 increased $5.4 million, or 13.3%, over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. The growth was primarily due to increased sales in Canada of $11.5 million as a result of the Ideal Pipe acquisition, offsetting soft sales performance in Mexico which declined by $5.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Slower public spending was the main factor for the decline in third quarter net sales in Mexico versus the comparable prior year period. In addition, the Canadian dollar was approximately 15% weaker against the U.S. dollar in the three month period ended December 31, 2015, compared to the three month period ended December 31, 2014, which had a negative impact on Net sales for Canada of $5.0 million during the three month period ended December 31, 2015. - 22 - System-Wide Net Sales for the third quarter ended December 31, 2015 were $330.9 million, a net increase of $29.5 million, or 9.8%, over System-Wide Net Sales of $301.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Net sales at our South American Joint Venture operation were down $1.4 million or 9.3% over the comparable prior year period. This decrease was offset by an increase in net sales at our domestic joint venture, Tigre-ADS USA, of $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31 2015, as compared to the prior fiscal year period. The company acquired a controlling interest in BaySaver during the second fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2016 and those sales are now included in the Company s consolidated net sales. During the comparable fiscal year 2015 period BaySaver contributed $2.9 million in sales. Cost of goods sold and Gross profit Cost of Goods Sold increased $8.8 million or 3.8% to $239.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $230.7 million over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. Gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2015 increased $24.1 million or 49.1% over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales totaled 23.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 17.6% for the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. Domestic gross profit increased $23.1 million, or 55.5%, to $64.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $41.8 million during the comparable prior year period. In addition to the impact of the 11.5% increase in domestic net sales over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period, the increase was driven by a reduction of 14.0% in the cost of pipe resin used in products sold during the quarter versus the comparable prior year period. Both virgin and non-virgin resin prices continued to decline during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Freight costs totaled 9.7% of domestic net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2015, compared to 9.5% for the prior year period. The higher costs relate to increased depreciation charges associated with new tractors and trailers added to the delivery fleet which offset the benefit of diesel fuel prices moving lower throughout the quarter. Diesel prices declined approximately 30.0% compared to the prior year period. International gross profit increased $1.0 million, or 13.0%, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. This was the result of the impact of the 13.3% increase in international net sales. Gross profit margins were negatively impacted by the continued devaluation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar as revenue from our Canadian subsidiaries is transacted in the Canadian dollar whereas the cost of raw material is substantially transacted in U.S. dollars. Selling expenses Selling expenses consist of field selling and customer service expenditures for personnel engaged in sales and sales support functions. Field selling and customer service expenditures primarily consists of personnel costs (salaries, benefits, and variable sales commissions), travel and entertainment expenses, marketing, promotion, and advertising expenses, as well as bad debt provisions. Selling expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2015 increased $2.0 million, or 9.9%, over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. The increase was primarily the result of increases in variable selling expenses due to higher sales volume and investments in additional sales coverage and growth initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses decreased slightly to 7.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to 7.1% for the comparable prior year period. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses consists of personnel costs (salaries, benefits, and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation), recruitment and relocation expenses, accounting and legal fees, business travel expenses, rent and utilities for the administrative offices, director fees, investor relations, membership fees, office supplies, insurance and other miscellaneous expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2015 increased $11.7 million, or 82.6%, over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. The large increase was related in part to incremental expenses for audit, tax, legal and other professional fees which amounted to $7.6 million related to the restatement of our previously filed financial statements as part of the preparation of our Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. There were no comparable amounts in the fiscal year 2015 period. In addition, salaries and compensation expense increased by $1.8 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 and there was an additional $0.6 million in general and administrative expense from the acquisition of the Ideal and BaySaver businesses, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $0.8 million during the period. The remaining increase related to higher corporate overhead including higher depreciation expense as well as increased legal and administrative costs associated with being a public company. Overall, general and administrative expenses amounted to 8.2% of net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2015 compared to 5.0% for the comparable prior year period. - 23 - Gain (loss) on disposal of assets or businesses Gain (loss) on disposal of assets for the three months ended December 31, 2014 changed from a loss of $0.2 million to a gain of $0.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. We did not dispose of any businesses during the three months ended December 31, 2015 or 2014. Intangible amortization Intangible amortization for the three months ended December 31, 2015 decreased $0.1 million, or 6.3%, over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period as a result of intangible assets of $7.8 million becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015 offset by the additional amortization for the Ideal Pipe intangible assets acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the BaySaver intangible assets acquired in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Interest expense Interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2015 decreased slightly, $0.1 million, or 2.0%, over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. The modest decrease in the current year third quarter was due to lower average interest rates on our outstanding indebtedness. Average debt outstanding was up only slightly compared to the prior year period, which modestly offset the impact of slightly lower rates. Derivative losses and other expense, net Derivative losses and other expense, net decreased $3.0 million over the comparable prior year period as a result of changes in both realized and unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities. The net derivative expense activity for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was $2.4 million (realized loss of $4.1 million less unrealized gain of $1.8 million). This compares to a net derivative expense of $6.5 million incurred during the comparable prior year period (realized loss of $0.4 million and an unrealized loss of $6.1 million). The balance of the change relates primarily to foreign currency transaction gains and other insignificant gains or losses. Income tax expense For the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $8.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively. These provisions represent an effective tax rate of 48.2% and 139.5%, respectively. Income before income taxes increased significantly compared to the prior year resulting in a much higher provision for income taxes. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2015 is lower than the prior year period primarily due to the shift in the projections of the proportion of income earned and higher income before income taxes reducing the impact of non-deductible items in our tax calculations. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $0.1 million from $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014 to $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interest Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the share of ADS Mexicana and BaySaver net income attributable to the minority interest holders. Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interest changed from income of $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014 to a loss of $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. The change is largely due to losses incurred by ADS Mexicana of $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 compared to income of $1.4 million for the prior fiscal year 2015 period. The balance of the change relates to activity for BaySaver. - 24 - Net loss attributable to ADS and Net loss per share Third quarter net income attributable to ADS for fiscal year 2016 was $8.0 million, improving from fiscal year 2015 third quarter s net loss attributable to ADS of $3.3 million, as influenced by the factors noted above. Net income per share for the third quarter fiscal year 2016 totaled $0.13 per basic and $0.12 per diluted share, as compared to a loss of $0.07 per basic and diluted share recorded in the comparable prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA(a) (a) See section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information. Nine Months Ended December31, 2015 Compared With Nine Months Ended December31, 2014 The following tables summarize certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Also included is certain information relating to the operating results as a percentage of net sales. (a) See section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information. - 25 - Net sales Net sales totaled $1,045.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, increasing $72.3 million, or 7.4%, over the comparable period for fiscal year 2015. The total sales growth when broken down between our Pipe and Allied Products, reflected increases of $36.4 million or 4.9% and $35.9 million or 15.4%, respectively, for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year period. Domestic net sales increased $43.6 million, or 5.1%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the prior year period. Domestic pipe sales increased $17.3 million, or 2.7%, due to continued growth in our N-12 HDPE and High Performance PP product lines offsetting lower agricultural sales. Allied Product sales increased $26.3 million, or 12.5%, due to strong sales volume sold primarily into the non-residential, residential and infrastructure markets. In addition, approximately $6.8 million of the total Allied Product sales increase relates to the acquisition of BaySaver during the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2016. International net sales increased $28.7 million, or 23.0%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. The growth was primarily due to increased sales in Canada, including in particular the contribution from the acquisition of Ideal Pipe, which increased sales by approximately $36.8 million, helping to offset decreased sales in Mexico of $3.5 million. In addition, the Canadian dollar was approximately 14% weaker against the U.S. dollar in the nine month period ended December 31, 2015, compared to the nine month period ended December 31, 2014, which had a negative impact on Net sales for Canada of $15.6 million during the nine month period ended December 31, 2015. System-Wide Net Sales were $1,103.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2016, an increase of $65.0 million, or 6.3%, over System-Wide Net Sales of $1,038.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2015. Net sales at our South American Joint Venture operation were negatively impacted by continued softness in the mining markets and an overall construction slowdown due to reduced public spending resulting in a sales decline of $4.4 million or 9.6% to $41.3 million. Net sales at our domestic joint ventures, Tigre-ADS USA and BaySaver, provided combined net sales for unconsolidated joint ventures of $16.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, down $2.8 million when compared to the prior fiscal year period. However, when taking into consideration the $6.8 million in net sales recognized for BaySaver subsequent to the July 2015 acquisition of the controlling interest, comparable sales are up $4.0 million or 20.5%. Cost of goods sold and Gross profit Cost of Goods Sold increased $22.4 million or 2.8% for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 compared with the same period during fiscal year 2015. Gross profit increased $49.8 million or 27.7% from $179.8 million to $229.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 compared with the same period in the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales totaled 22.0% for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 18.5% for the prior year. - 26 - Domestic gross profit increased $36.7 million, or 22.7%, to $198.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $161.4 million during the prior year period. In addition to the impact of the 5.1% increase in domestic net sales over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period, the increase was also driven by a reduction in raw material costs of approximately 8.4%, particularly pipe resin costs. Raw material prices were flat in the first quarter and then declined in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year periods. Freight costs totaled 9.6% of domestic net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, compared to 9.3% for the prior year period. Diesel prices began to moderate after the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 and continued to decline throughout fiscal 2016. The higher costs relate to increased depreciation charges associated with new tractors and trailers added to the delivery fleet, which offset the benefit of diesel fuel prices moving lower throughout the quarter. Diesel prices were approximately 31.0% below the prior fiscal year for the nine-month period. International gross profit increased $13.2 million, or 71.6%, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2016 over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period. This was the result of the impact of a 23.0% increase in international net sales. Gross profit was also helped by improved gross profit performance in Mexico for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, as Mexico benefitted from lower resin costs. Selling expenses Selling expenses consist of field selling and customer service for personnel engaged in sales and sales support functions. Field selling and customer service expenditures primarily consists of personnel costs (salaries, benefits, and variable sales commissions), travel and entertainment expenses, marketing, promotion, and advertising expenses, as well as bad debt provisions. Selling expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 increased $6.0 million, or 10.0%, over the comparable fiscal year 2015 period, growing at a higher rate than the change in net sales. The increase was primarily the result of increases in selling expenses related to Ideal Pipe and BaySaver, variable selling expenses due to higher sales volume and investments in additional sales coverage and growth initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses increased slightly to 6.3% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to 6.1% for the comparable prior year period. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses consists of personnel costs (salaries, benefits, and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation), recruitment and relocation expenses, accounting and legal fees, business travel expenses, rent and utilities for the administrative offices, director fees, investor relations, membership fees, office supplies, insurance and other miscellaneous expenses. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 increased $25.4 million, or 58.2%, over the comparable 2015 fiscal year period. The increase was primarily the result of significant increases in professional fees for accounting, audit, tax, legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of our previously filed financial statements as part of the preparation of our Fiscal 2015 Form10-K. There were no such amounts in the comparable fiscal 2015 period. These fees amounted to approximately $16.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015. There was also an increase in salary and compensation expenses of $2.2 million, as well as incremental general and administrative expenses related to the Ideal Pipe and BaySaver acquisitions of $1.4 million. The remaining increase related to higher corporate overhead including higher depreciation expense as well as increased legal and administrative costs associated with being a public company. Overall, general and administrative expenses amounted to 6.6% of net sales compared to 4.5% in the prior year. Loss on disposal of assets or businesses Loss on the disposal of assets or businesses for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was not significant for either period, amounting to losses of $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively. - 27 - Intangible amortization Intangible amortization for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 decreased $0.6 million, or 6.6%, over the comparable prior year period as a result of intangible assets of $7.8 million becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015, offset by the additional amortization for the Ideal Pipe intangible assets acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the BaySaver intangible assets acquired in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Interest expense Interest expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 decreased $0.7 million, or 5.2%, over the comparable prior year period. The decrease was due to both slightly lower average interest rates on our outstanding Revolving Credit Facility, most of which is based on LIBOR, in addition to a modestly lower average outstanding debt balance over the nine-month period. For the prior period ended December 31, 2014, the Company carried a higher Revolving Credit Facility balance through July 2014 until the IPO proceeds were used to reduce the Revolving Credit Facility balance. Additionally, during the nine-month period ending December 31, 2014, a 2% surcharge on our Senior Notes was incurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 due to our leverage ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Funded Debt exceeding three times at June 30, 2014. The surcharge increased interest expense by $0.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, and there was no such amount incurred in fiscal year 2016. Derivative losses and other expense, net Derivative losses and other expense, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 increased $13.2 million over the comparable prior year period. The increase in expense is predominantly a result of both realized and unrealized losses on hedging activities. The hedging losses for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 were $18.4 million comprised of realized losses on cash settlements of $10.6 million and unrealized losses on mark-to-market adjustments of $7.8 million. This compares to a net hedging loss of $6.6 million incurred during the prior nine month period, consisting of realized losses on cash settlements of $0.4 million and unrealized losses of $6.2 million on the unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments. In addition to the hedging losses, the Company realized a loss of $0.5 million upon completing the acquisition of BaySaver as a result of remeasuring our investment as of the July 17, 2015 step acquisition. See Note 2. Acquisitions. The balance of the change relates primarily to foreign currency transaction activity and other insignificant gains or losses. Income tax expense For the nine months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded income tax provisions of $19.8 million and $20.2 million, respectively, which represent an effective tax rate of 36.2% and 41.8%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of the fiscal 2016 is lower than the prior year period primarily due to the shift in the projections of the proportion of income earned and higher income before income taxes reducing the impact of non-deductible items in our tax calculations. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates represent our proportionate share of net loss attributed to the two unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have significant influence, but not control, over operations as well as our proportional share of BaySaver earnings up until the July 17, 2015 step acquisition. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 decreased $0.8 million over the comparable prior fiscal year period to a net loss of $0.9 million compared to a net loss of $1.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower net losses generated by the South American Joint Venture which reduced our share of the losses during the nine-months ended December 31, 2015 to $1.2 million compared to $2.0 million for the comparable prior year period. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents income attributable to the noncontrolling interest holders in joint venture operations that are consolidated in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased $0.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 to $4.5 million compared to $4.4 million for the comparable prior year period. As noted above, the 35.0% noncontrolling interest for BaySaver is now included in the fiscal 2016 results beginning after July 17, 2015. - 28 - Net income attributable to ADS and Net income per share Net income attributable to ADS of $29.6 million increased from the preceding fiscal year s net income attributable to ADS of $22.1 million, as influenced by the factors noted above. Net income per share for the first nine months of fiscal year 2016 totaled $0.48 and $0.46 per basic and diluted per share, respectively, as compared to net income per share of $0.19 per basic and diluted share recorded in the comparable prior year period. The net income per share for the nine months ended December 31, 2014 was impacted by changes in fair value appreciation of Redeemable convertible preferred stock classified in mezzanine equity which reduced income available to common stockholders by $11.1 million, or $0.22 per share for common stockholders. Adjusted EBITDA (a) (a) See section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, System-Wide Net Sales and Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is comprised of net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, non-cash charges and certain other expenses. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance and evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated: - 29 - (a) Includes our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In addition, these amounts include our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our BaySaver joint venture prior to our acquisition of BaySaver on July 17, 2015, which was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting. (b) Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of our prior period financial statements as reflected in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. (c) Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with our secondary public offering in fiscal year 2015. Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income The following table presents a reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated: (a) Includes our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In addition, these amounts include our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our BaySaver joint venture prior to our acquisition of BaySaver on July 17, 2015, which was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting. (b) Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of our prior period financial statements as reflected in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. (c) Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with our IPO and secondary public offering in fiscal year 2015. - 30 - (a) Includes our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In addition, these amounts include our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our BaySaver joint venture prior to our acquisition of BaySaver on July 17, 2015, which was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

(c) Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with our IPO and secondary public offering in fiscal year 2015. System-Wide Net Sales . System-Wide Net Sales is a non-GAAP measure which equals the sum of the net sales of our domestic and international segments plus all net sales from our unconsolidated joint ventures. We participated in three unconsolidated joint ventures during the nine months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014; the South American Joint Venture, Tigre-ADS USA, Inc. ( Tigre-ADS USA , which is 49% owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary ADS/V), and BaySaver prior to July 17, 2015. We use this metric to measure the overall performance of our business across all of our geographies and markets we serve. Our South American Joint Venture is managed as an integral part of our international segment, and our Tigre-ADS USA and BaySaver joint ventures are managed as an integral part of our domestic segment. However, they are not consolidated under GAAP, with the exception of our BaySaver joint venture which we have consolidated since we acquired a controlling interest on July 17, 2015. System-Wide Net Sales is prepared as if our South American Joint Venture, our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, and our BaySaver joint venture were accounted for as consolidated subsidiaries for all periods. The reconciliation of our System-Wide Net Sales to Net sales is as follows: (a) On July 31, 2009, we entered into an arrangement to form our South American Joint Venture. - 31 - (b) On July 15, 2013, we entered into an arrangement to form our BaySaver joint venture. As of July 17, 2015, we increased our ownership to 65%, and have consolidated BaySaver since that date. As such, Net Sales from our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015 are included in this line item. (c) On April 7, 2014, we entered into an arrangement to form our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture. Adjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share . Adjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share is a non-GAAP measure and is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We calculate Adjusted earnings per fully converted share (Non-GAAP) by adjusting our Net income per share Basic and Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures. To effect this adjustment, we have (1) removed the accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest, (2) removed the adjustment for the change in fair value of Redeemable convertible preferred stock classified as mezzanine equity from the numerator of the Net income per share Basic computation, (3) added back the dividends to Redeemable convertible preferred stockholders and dividends paid to unvested restricted stockholders, (4) made corresponding adjustments to the amount allocated to participating securities under the two-class earnings per share computation method, and (5) added back ESOP deferred compensation attributable to the shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock allocated to employee ESOP accounts during the applicable period, which is a non-cash charge to our earnings and not deductible for income tax purposes. We have also made adjustments to the Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic to assume, (1) share conversion of the Redeemable convertible preferred stock to outstanding shares of common stock and (2) add shares of outstanding unvested restricted stock. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is included in this report because it is a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) to our Net Income attributable to ADS, Net income per share and corresponding Weighted average common shares outstanding amounts, the most comparable GAAP measures, for each of the periods indicated. - 32 - Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity requirements are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, and dividend payments for our convertible preferred stock and common stock. We have historically funded, and expect to continue to fund, our operation primarily through internally generated cash flow, debt financings and equity issuances. From time to time we may explore additional financing methods and other means to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. As of December 31, 2015, we had $5.2 million in cash that was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to reinvest our earnings in foreign subsidiaries. In the event that foreign earnings are repatriated, these amounts will be subject to income tax liabilities in the appropriate tax jurisdiction. No restrictions exist on our liquidity that is impacted by the significance of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. Working Capital and Cash Flows During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, our net increase in cash amounted to $2.8 million, compared to a net increase of $6.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2014. During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, our source of funds was primarily driven by higher operating earnings and a decrease in inventory of $65.7 million. For the same period ending December 31, 2015, our use of cash was primarily driven by increased accounts receivable balances (up $17.5 million), decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities including accrued income taxes ($14.9 million), capital expenditures ($30.0 million), payments on capital lease obligations ($14.9 million), the acquisition of an additional 10% interest in BaySaver and repayment of $62.5 million of Long Term Debt. During the nine months ended December 31, 2014, our source of funds was primarily driven by higher operating earnings, proceeds of $79.1 million from our IPO of common stock and increased non-cash charges (ESOP and stock-based compensation expense and mark-to-market adjustments for changes in fair value of derivative contracts) and a decrease in inventory of $40.1 million. For the same period ending December 31, 2014, our increased use of cash was primarily driven by increased accounts receivable balances (up $12.8 million), decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities including accrued income taxes ($17.8 million), spending for capital expenditures ($21.3 million), payments on capital lease obligations ($6.6 million), investments in joint ventures ($7.6 million) and repayment of $115.6 million of Long Term Debt. As of December 31, 2015, we had $182.9 million in liquidity, including $6.4 million of cash and $176.5 million in borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility, described below. We believe that our cash on hand, together with the availability of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and other financing arrangements and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, scheduled interest payments on our indebtedness and dividend payment requirement for our convertible preferred stock for at least the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2015, we had consolidated indebtedness (excluding lease obligations) of approximately $337.4 million, down $62.5 million compared to March 31, 2015. We repaid a portion of our outstanding indebtedness with operating cash flow. The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented: Working Capital Net working capital decreased from $249.2 million as of March 31, 2015, to $190.8 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to the decline in inventory of $65.7 million resulting primarily from a seasonal decrease in the cost of raw material resins on hand at December 31, 2015, and an increase in the current maturities of debt and capital lease obligations of $28.9 million, offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $17.5 million due to sales increases and a $14.9 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and accrued income taxes. - 33 - Operating Cash Flows During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, cash provided from operating activities was $129.4 million as compared with $90.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2014. Cash flow from operating activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2015 was impacted by higher net income, increased depreciation and amortization, and decreased inventory balances, offsetting the use of cash related to changes in receivables accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2014 was impacted by moderately higher net income, share-based compensation, inventory and accounts payable compared to the prior period, offsetting an increase in the use of cash related to changes in accounts receivable and other accrued liabilities, including accrued income taxes. Investing Cash Flows During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, cash used for investing activities was $35.4 million, primarily due to $30.0 million for capital expenditures, $1.5 million for software in support of operations, and a $3.2 million investment in an additional 10% of the membership interests in BaySaver. During the nine months ended December 31, 2014, cash used for investing activities was $29.4 million, primarily due to $21.3 million for capital expenditures in support of operations, a $3.6 million investment in a domestic joint venture operation created in the first quarter fiscal 2015, and a $4.0 million investment in our international joint venture operation to support growth initiatives. Financing Cash Flows During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, cash used for financing activities was $89.8 million, primarily due to utilizing our operating cash flow to pay down debt of $62.5 million as well as payments of $14.9 million for lease obligations and $12.7 million for dividends. During the nine months ended December 31, 2014, cash used for financing activities was $53.6 million, primarily due to utilizing our operating cash flow and $79.1 million of proceeds from the IPO to pay down debt of $115.6 million as well as payments for $6.6 million for lease obligations, $4.3 million in dividends, and $6.5 million for fees related to the IPO. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures totaled $30.0 million and $21.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our capital expenditures for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 were used primarily to support facility expansions, equipment replacements, and our recycled resin initiatives. We currently anticipate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $45 million in fiscal year 2016. Such capital expenditures are expected to be financed using funds generated by operations. As of December 31, 2015, there were no material contractual obligations or commitments related to these planned capital expenditures. Financing Transactions Bank Term Loans On September 24, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, or PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June 12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for our Bank Term Loans consisting of (i) the Revolving Credit Facility providing for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million, (ii) the Term Loan Facility providing for the Term Loans in an aggregate original principal amount of $100.0 million, and (iii) the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility, described below. The Bank Term Loans also permit us to add additional commitments to the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility not to exceed $50 million in the aggregate. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility are primarily used to provide for our ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs, to finance acquisitions and distributions, and for our other general corporate purposes. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were primarily used for our general corporate purposes. The interest rates on the Bank Term Loans are determined by certain base rates or LIBOR rates, plus an applicable margin. The obligations under the Bank Term Loans are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our personal property assets. On December 20, 2013, we amended the Revolving Credit Facility to, among other terms, make certain amendments in order to permit the payment of a cash dividend.

Senior Notes On December 11, 2009, we entered into a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management Inc., or Prudential, which agreement, as amended and restated on September 24, 2010 and subsequently further amended, provides for the issuance by us of senior secured promissory notes to Prudential or its affiliates from time to time in the aggregate principal amount up to $100.0 million. Pursuant to the private shelf agreement, on September 27, 2010, we issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.60% Senior Series A Notes due September 24, 2018 to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock from certain of our stockholders and to repurchase outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock from the ESOP. On July 24, 2013, we issued $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 4.05% Senior Series B Notes due September 24, 2019 for our general corporate purposes. The Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets. On December 20, 2013, we amended the private shelf agreement to, among other things, make certain amendments in order to permit the payment of a cash dividend. For further information about the Senior Notes, see Note 12. Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

Covenant Compliance Our outstanding debt agreements and instruments contain various restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on additional indebtedness and capital distributions, including dividend payments. The two primary debt covenants include a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Ratio. For any relevant period of determination, the Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Consolidated Indebtedness (funded debt plus guarantees) by Consolidated EBITDA. The current upper limit is 4.0 times. The Fixed Charge Ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of Consolidated EBITDA minus Capital Expenditures minus cash Income Taxes paid, by the sum of Fixed Charges. Fixed Charges include cash Interest expense, scheduled principal payments on Indebtedness, and ESOP Capital Distributions in excess of $10.0 million in a given fiscal year. The current minimum ratio is 1.25 times. For further information, see Note 12. Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2015. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, with the exception of the guarantee of 50% of certain debt of our unconsolidated South American Joint Venture, as further discussed in Note 6. Related Party Transactions of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2015, our South American Joint Venture had approximately $13.7 million of outstanding debt. We do not believe that this guarantee will have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. - 35 - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no changes in critical accounting policies from those disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K.

We consolidate all of our joint ventures for purposes of GAAP, except for our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture. Overview We are the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the underground construction and infrastructure marketplace. Our innovative products are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform, our overall product breadth and scale and our manufacturing excellence. In the United States, our national footprint combined with our strong local presence and broad product offering make us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $10.8 billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity. Our products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following our entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, our pipe has been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets. This has allowed us to consistently gain share and achieve above-market growth throughout economic cycles. We expect to continue to drive conversion to our products from traditional materials as contractors, civil design engineers and municipal agencies increasingly acknowledge the superior physical attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products. In addition, we believe that overall demand for our products will benefit as the regulatory environment continues to evolve. Our broad product line includes HDPE pipe, PP pipe and related water management products. Building on our core drainage businesses, we have aggressively pursued attractive ancillary product categories such as storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings and filters, and water quality filters and separators. We refer to these ancillary product categories as Allied Products. Given the scope of our overall sales and distribution platform, we have been able to drive growth within our Allied Products and believe there are significant growth opportunities going forward. Results of Operations Three Months Ended June30, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended June30, 2015 The following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net sales that have been derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. We believe this presentation is useful to investors in comparing historical results. - 16 - Net sales. Net sales totaled $357.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, increasing $8.5 million, or 2.4%, over the comparable period in fiscal year 2016. Domestic net sales increased $14.6 million, or 4.9%, in the three months ended June 30, 2016, over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. Our domestic pipe sales increased by $2.8 million, or 1.3%, which was a result of our volume gains of $3.4 million achieved in our construction end markets, which was offset by declines in our agriculture end market and essentially flat sales prices. Allied product sales increased $11.9 million, or 15.2%, which included the impact of the acquisition of BaySaver of $3.9 million, as well as increased sales volume of products sold primarily into the construction end markets. International net sales decreased $6.2 million, or 12.1%, in the three months ended June 30, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily attributable to pipe volume decreases of $5.5 million in Mexico and Canada, along with a decrease of $1.5 million from a weaker Canadian dollar to U.S. Dollar exchange rate, offset by an increase in Allied products sales of $1.9 million. Cost of goods sold and Gross profit. Cost of goods sold decreased by $13.7 million, or 5.0%, and gross profit increased by $22.1 million, or 29.7%, in the three months ended June 30, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. - 17 - In addition to the impact of the increase in domestic net sales of 4.9% over the comparable fiscal year 2016 period, the increase in domestic gross profit of $26.0 million, or 42.2%, was also impacted by decreased raw material costs and lower diesel fuel prices. Growth in sales of higher margin Allied Products also contributed to the overall increase in gross profit. International gross profit decreased $3.9 million, or 30.6%, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016, largely due to decreases in sales volume. Selling expenses. Selling expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased 14.1% over the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of increases in variable selling expenses due to higher sales volume and investments in additional sales coverage. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses increased to 6.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to 6.1% in the prior year. General and administrative expenses . The large increase of $15.8 million was primarily due to increased expenses for audit, tax, legal and other professional fees of $9.2 million related to the preparation of our fiscal year 2016 Forms 10-Q and 10-K that were delayed due to the restatement of prior period financial statements as reflected in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K, as well as a $7.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. Loss on disposal of assets or businesses . There were no large or unusual disposals of assets or businesses. Intangible amortization . Intangible amortization remained relatively flat. Interest expense . While our average overall outstanding debt was down by approximately $58.4 million, or 13.9%, for the quarter ending June 30, 2016 compared to the average balance outstanding for the quarter ending June 30, 2015 the impact of that on interest expense was more than offset by higher average capital lease obligations for the quarter ending June 30, 2016 compared to the quarter ending June 30, 2015, which resulted in higher overall interest expense in the current year period. Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net . During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we benefited from unrealized gains on swaps for propylene raw material of $3.3 million compared to unrealized losses of $5.1 million in the comparable period last year. In addition, an incremental $1.0 million of hedging losses were recognized compared to the prior year, primarily in connection with realized losses on propylene material swaps. The remainder is related to foreign exchange gains of $1.8 million and other non-operating income of $0.1 million. Income tax expense . For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had effective tax rates of 42.1% and 38.8%, respectively. These rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to state and local income taxes and non-deductible expenses, partially offset by foreign income taxed at lower rates. Equity in net loss (income) of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in net loss (income) of unconsolidated affiliates represents our proportionate share of income or loss attributed to two unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have significant influence, but not control, over operations as well as our proportional share of BaySaver earnings up until the July 17, 2015 step acquisition. Our proportional share of BaySaver earnings was $0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, whereas there was no comparable amount in the three months ended June 30, 2016. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest . Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the three months ended June 30, 2016 remained relatively flat. As noted above, the 35% noncontrolling interest for BaySaver is now included in the consolidated results beginning after July 17, 2015. The performance of BaySaver in the fiscal 2017 period offset the impact of the change in results of ADS-Mexicana. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, System-Wide Net Sales, Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share and Free Cash Flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. - 18 - Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measure. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated: (a) Includes our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In addition, these amounts include our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our BaySaver Joint Venture prior to our step acquisition of BaySaver on July 17, 2015, which was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting. (b) The amounts in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 represent legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred primarily in connection with the preparation of our fiscal year 2016 Forms 10-Q and 10-K that were delayed due to the restatement of prior period financial statements as reflected in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. System-Wide Net Sales (Non-GAAP) . System-Wide Net Sales is a non-GAAP measure we use to measure the overall performance of our business across all of our geographies and markets we serve. Our South American Joint Venture is managed as an integral part of our International segment, and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and our BaySaver joint venture are managed as integral parts of our Domestic segment. System-Wide Net Sales is prepared as if our South American Joint Venture, our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, and our BaySaver joint venture (prior to its acquisition on July 17, 2015) were accounted for as consolidated subsidiaries for all periods. The reconciliation of our System-Wide Net Sales to Net sales is as follows: (a) As of July 17, 2015, we increased our ownership in BaySaver to 65% and have consolidated BaySaver since that date. As such Net Sales from our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015 are included in this line item. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) . Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a non-GAAP, supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance as if all shares held by the ESOP were to be converted to common shares. This information is useful to investors as the preferred shares held by the ESOP are required to be distributed to our employees over time, which is done in the form of common stock after the conversion of the preferred shares. As such, this measure is included in this report because it provides the investors with information to understand the impact on the financial statements once all preferred shares are converted and distributed. - 19 - Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. We calculate Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) by adjusting our historical Net income per share Basic, Net income available to common stockholders Basic, and Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic amounts for the conversion of all shares of Redeemable convertible preferred stock into ADS common stock at the conversion ratio of one share of redeemable convertible preferred stock for every 0.7692 share of common stock as of the beginning of each period presented. To effect this adjustment with respect to Net income available to common stockholders - Basic, we have (1) added back the accretion of Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries, (2) added back the dividends to Redeemable convertible preferred stockholders and dividends paid to unvested restricted stockholders, (3) added back the amount allocated to participating securities under the two class earnings per share computation method, and (4) added back ESOP deferred compensation attributable to the shares of Redeemable convertible preferred stock allocated to employee ESOP accounts during the applicable period, which is a non-cash charge to our earnings. We have also made adjustments to the Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic to (1) assume share conversion of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock to common stock and (2) add shares of outstanding unvested restricted stock. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP), Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding Fully Converted (Non-GAAP) and Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) to Net income available to common stockholders -Basic, Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic, and Net income per share - Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures, respectively, for each of the periods indicated. Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) . Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management and the Company s board of directors to assess the Company s ability to generate cash. Management believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our measure of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The following table presents a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to Cash flow from operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated. - 20 - Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity requirements are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and dividend payments for our convertible preferred stock and common stock. We have historically funded, and expect to continue to fund, our operations primarily through internally generated cash flow, debt financings, equity issuance and capital and operating leases. From time to time, we may explore additional financing methods and other means to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. As of June 30, 2016, we had $2.5 million in cash that was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings in foreign subsidiaries with the exception of cash dividends paid by our ADS Mexicana joint venture. In the event that foreign earnings are repatriated, these amounts will be subject to income tax liabilities in the appropriate tax jurisdiction. Working Capital and Cash Flows During the three months ended June 30, 2016, our source of funds was primarily driven by operating earnings and seasonal borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, our source of funds was primarily driven by operating earnings, seasonal borrowings on our Revolving Credit facility, and proceeds from notes, mortgages and other debt. For both the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, our use of cash was primarily driven by seasonal increases in accounts receivable and capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2016, we had $132.3 million in liquidity, including $9.2 million of cash and $123.1 million in borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility, described below. We believe that our cash on hand, together with the availability of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and other financing arrangements and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, scheduled interest payments on our indebtedness and the dividend payment requirement for our convertible preferred stock for at least the next twelve months. As of June 30, 2016, we had total consolidated net indebtedness of approximately $445.9 million. This amount includes capital lease obligations and is net of cash. Working Capital . Working capital increased to $220.3 million as of June 30, 2016, from $187.4 million as of March 31, 2016, primarily due to the increases in account receivable of $25.3 million resulting from sales increases and an increase of $8.2 million in inventory for planned sales increases. As disclosed in Note 1, the change in working capital is also impacted by the reduction of net current deferred tax assets from $11.7 million as of March 31, 2016 to $0 as of June 30, 2016 as all deferred tax assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2016 are now classified as non-current. Operating Cash Flows. Cash flows from operating activities for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was a use of $0.1 million as compared with cash used by operating activities of $18.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Cash flows from operating activities during the three months ended June 30, 2016 was impacted by higher net income as a result of lower resin costs partially offset by restatement-related costs, as well as lower income tax cash payments and slower growth in accounts receivable compared to the prior year. Investing Cash Flows. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, cash used for investing activities was $12.8 million and $15.6 million, respectively, primarily due to capital expenditures in support of operations. Financing Cash Flows. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, cash provided from financing activities was $16.2 million, due to increased borrowings on our Revolving Credit facility to support our typical seasonal demand increase following the winter months. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $34.7 million, utilizing borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility to support our typical seasonal demand increase and proceeds from notes, mortgages, and other debt. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures totaled $12.6 million and $11.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. Our capital expenditures for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were used primarily to support facility expansions, equipment replacements, our recycled resin initiatives and capitalized software. - 21 - We currently anticipate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $50 million to $55 million in fiscal year 2017. Such capital expenditures are expected to be financed using funds generated by operations. As of June 30, 2016, there were no material contractual obligations or commitments related to these planned capital expenditures. Financing Transactions Bank Term Loans On September 24, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, or PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June 12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for our Bank Term Loans consisting of (i) the Revolving Credit Facility providing for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $325 million, (ii) the Term Loan Facility providing for the Term Loans in an aggregate original principal amount of $100 million, and (iii) the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility, described below, which is more fully described in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding principal drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility was $191.3 million, with $123.1 million available to be drawn on the U.S. facility. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan was $80.0 million. ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility On September 24, 2010, our joint venture ADS Mexicana entered into a credit agreement with PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June 12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $12 million. According to the terms of the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility, ADS Mexicana is not permitted to make loans to ADS, Inc. As of June 30, 2016, there was no outstanding principal drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility and the entire $12.0 million was available to be drawn. Senior Notes On December 11, 2009, we entered into a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management Inc., or Prudential, which agreement, as amended and restated on September 24, 2010 and subsequently further amended, provides for the issuance by us of senior secured promissory notes to Prudential or its affiliates from time to time in the aggregate principal amount up to $100 million, which is more fully described in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A. We have no further amount available for issuance of senior notes under the private shelf agreement. At June 30, 2016, the outstanding principal balance on these notes was $100.0 million. July, October and December 2016 Consents Related to the Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes In July 2016, the Company obtained consents from the lenders of the Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes. These consents had the effect of extending the time for delivery of our fiscal 2016 audited financial statements to August 31, 2016 and first quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly financial information to October 15, 2016, whereby an event of default was waived as long as those items are delivered within a 15 day grace period after those dates. The fiscal 2016 audited financial statements were delivered within the grace period. In addition, the consents also permitted the Company s payment of quarterly dividends of $0.06 per share on common shares in each of June and September 2016, as well as the annual dividend of $0.0195 per share to be paid on shares of preferred stock in March 2017. In October 2016, the Company obtained additional consents from the lenders of the Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes. These consents had the effect of extending the time for delivery of our first quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly financial information to November 30, 2016 and our second quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly financial information to December 31, 2016, whereby an event of default was waived as long as those items are delivered within a 30 day grace period after those dates. In addition, the consents also permitted the Company s payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share on common shares in December 2016, as well as the annual dividend of $0.0195 per share to be paid on shares of preferred stock in March 2017. In December 2016, the Company obtained additional consents from the lenders of the Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes. These consents had the effect of extending the time for delivery of our first quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly financial information to January 31, 2017. Covenant Compliance Our outstanding debt agreements and instruments contain various restrictive financial covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on additional indebtedness and capital distributions, including dividend payments. The two primary debt covenants include a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio maintenance covenant. For any relevant period of determination, the Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Consolidated Indebtedness (funded debt plus guarantees) by Consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit facility. The current upper limit is 4.0 times. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of - 22 - Consolidated EBITDA minus Capital Expenditures minus cash income taxes paid, by the sum of Fixed Charges. Fixed Charges include cash interest expense, scheduled principal payments on indebtedness, and ESOP capital distributions in excess of $10 million in a given fiscal year. The current minimum ratio is 1.25 times. For further information, see Note 12. Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of June 30, 2016, with the exception of the determination in December 2016 that certain intercompany loans between ADS Mexicana and ADS, Inc. had occurred between November 2014 and November 2015 that triggered an event of default according to the terms of the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility. On December 13, 2016, ADS Mexicana obtained a covenant waiver from the lenders. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Excluding the guarantee of 50% of certain debt of our unconsolidated South American Joint Venture, as further discussed in Note 4. Related Party Transactions to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangement. As of June 30, 2016, our South American Joint Venture had approximately $19.1 million of outstanding debt. We do not believe that this guarantee will have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no changes in critical accounting policies from those disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our fiscal year begins on April1 and ends on March31. Unless otherwise noted, references to year pertain to our fiscal year. For example, 2017 refers to fiscal 2017, which is the period from April1, 2016 to March31, 2017. The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) on January10, 2017. In addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. For more information, see the section below entitled Forward Looking Statements. We consolidate all of our joint ventures for purposes of GAAP, except for our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture. Overview We are the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the underground construction and infrastructure marketplace. Our innovative products are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform, our overall product breadth and scale and our manufacturing excellence. In the United States, our national footprint combined with our strong local presence and broad product offering make us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $10.8 billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity. Our products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following our entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, our pipe has been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets. This has allowed us to consistently gain share and achieve above-market growth throughout economic cycles. We expect to continue to drive conversion to our products from traditional materials as contractors, civil design engineers and municipal agencies increasingly acknowledge the superior physical attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products. In addition, we believe that overall demand for our products will benefit as the regulatory environment continues to evolve. Our broad product line includes HDPE pipe, PP pipe and related water management products. Building on our core drainage businesses, we have aggressively pursued attractive ancillary product categories such as storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings and filters, and water quality filters and separators. We refer to these ancillary product categories as Allied Products. Given the scope of our overall sales and distribution platform, we have been able to drive growth within our Allied Products and believe there are significant growth opportunities going forward. Results of Operations Three Months Ended September30, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended September30, 2015 The following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net sales that have been derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We believe this presentation is useful to investors in comparing historical results. - 18 - Net sales. Net sales totaled $360.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreasing $22.5 million, or 5.9%, over the comparable period in fiscal year 2016. Domestic net sales decreased $15.5 million, or 4.7%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. Our domestic pipe sales decreased by $16.3 million, or 6.8%, which was a result of net volume decreases of $12.5 million, primarily in our agriculture end markets, as well as a decrease resulting from lower prices. Allied product sales increased $0.8 million, or 0.8%, which included the impact of the acquisition of BaySaver. International net sales decreased $7.0 million, or 12.5%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily attributable to pipe volume decreases of $5.3 million in our international markets and a decrease in Allied products sales of $1.4 million. Cost of goods sold and Gross profit. Cost of goods sold decreased by $26.5 million, or 8.9%, and gross profit increased by $4.0 million, or 4.6%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. - 19 - The increase in domestic gross profit of $3.6 million, or 4.7%, was primarily the result of lower raw material costs, as well as decreases in diesel fuel prices and other transportation and manufacturing costs, which more than offset the impact of the decrease in domestic net sales of 4.7% over the comparable fiscal year 2016 period. International gross profit increased $0.4 million, or 3.6%, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016, largely due to the impact of lower raw material costs more than offsetting the impact of the decrease in international net sales of 12.5% over the comparable fiscal year 2016 period. Selling expenses. Selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $0.6 million, or 2.7%, over the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of increases in variable selling expenses including an increase in bad debt expense and investments in additional sales coverage. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses increased to 6.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to 5.9% in the prior year. General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $4.5 million from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in expenses for audit, tax, legal and other professional fees related to the restatement of prior period financial statements as reflected in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K and the preparation of our fiscal year 2016 Forms 10-Q and 10-K that were delayed due to the restatement from $8.7 million for the three months ending September 30, 2015 to $5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. In addition, stock-based compensation decreased from an expense of $1.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 to a benefit of $2.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Those decreases were partially offset by increased staff levels and increased use of outside consultants in various corporate functions. Loss on disposal of assets or businesses . There were no large or unusual disposals of assets or businesses. Intangible amortization . Intangible amortization remained relatively flat. Interest expense . Our average overall outstanding debt was down by $71.0 million, or 16.4%, for the quarter ending September 30, 2016 compared to the average balance outstanding for the quarter ending September 30, 2015, which was the primary reason for the decrease in interest expense. That impact was partially offset by higher average capital lease obligations for the quarter ending September 30, 2016 compared to the quarter ending September 30, 2015. Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net . Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net improved from losses of $9.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to gains of $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we benefited from unrealized gains on swaps for propylene raw material of $3.3 million compared to unrealized losses of $4.5 million in the comparable period last year. In addition, a $1.4 million decrease in hedging losses were recognized compared to the prior year, primarily in connection with realized losses on propylene material swaps. In addition, the three months ended September 30, 2015 included a loss of $0.5 million recognized for the fair value remeasurement of the Company s original investment in BaySaver at the time the Company acquired a controlling interest in July 2015, whereas there was no comparable amount in the current year period. The remainder of the change is primarily related to foreign exchange gains. Income tax expense . For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had effective tax rates of 37.9% and 24.1%, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, uncertain tax positions related to foreign jurisdictions were released due to the lapse of statute of limitations. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates represents our proportionate share of income or loss attributed to two unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have significant influence, but not control, over operations as well as our proportional share of BaySaver earnings up until the July 17, 2015 step acquisition. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates remained relatively flat. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest . Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased from $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The change is primarily attributable to a decrease in the profitability of ADS Mexicana. - 20 - Six Months Ended September30, 2016 Compared With Six Months Ended September30, 2015 The following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net sales that have been derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We believe this presentation is useful to investors in comparing historical results. Net sales. Net sales totaled $718.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2016, decreasing $14.1 million, or 1.9%, over the comparable period in fiscal year 2016. Domestic net sales decreased $0.9 million, or 0.1%, in the six months ended September 30, 2016, over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. Our domestic pipe sales decreased by $13.4 million, or 2.9%, which was primarily a result of net price decreases of $4.7 million and decreases of $5.1 million in net volume primarily due to a decline in our agriculture end markets, partially offset by improvements in non-residential end markets. Allied product sales increased $12.6 million, or 7.5%, which included the impact of the acquisition of BaySaver of $5.3 million, as well as increased sales volume of products sold primarily into the non-residential and infrastructure end markets. International net sales decreased $13.2 million, or 12.3%, in the six months ended September 30, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily attributable to the negative impact in Mexico of pipe volume decreases of $12.8 million and net price decreases of $2.6 million, along with a decrease of $2.1 million from weaker exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the Canadian and Mexican currencies, offset by a modest increase in Allied products sales. - 21 - Cost of goods sold and Gross profit. Cost of goods sold decreased by $40.2 million, or 7.0%, and gross profit increased by $26.1 million, or 16.2%, in the six months ended September 30, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in domestic gross profit of $29.6 million, or 21.5%, was primarily the result of lower raw material costs, as well as lower diesel fuel prices, which more than offset the impact of the relatively flat domestic net sales. Growth in sales of higher margin Allied Products also contributed to the overall increase in gross profit. International gross profit decreased $3.5 million, or 15.2%, in the first half of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016, largely due to decreases in sales volume, partially offset by lower raw material costs. Selling expenses. Selling expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 increased $3.6 million, or 8.3% over the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of increases in variable selling expenses, including an increase in bad debt expense of $2.8 million resulting from the deterioration of certain customer accounts and the investment in additional sales coverage. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses increased to 6.6% in the first half of fiscal 2017 as compared to 6.0% in the prior year period. General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 increased $11.4 million over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses for audit, tax, legal and other professional fees related to the restatement of prior period financial statements as reflected in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K and the preparation of our fiscal year 2016 Forms 10-Q and 10-K that were delayed due to the restatement from $8.7 million for the six months ending September 30, 2015 to $15.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016. In addition, stock-based compensation expense increased from $2.2 million for the first half of fiscal 2016 to $5.9 million for first half of fiscal 2017. The increased staff levels and increased use of outside consultants in various corporate functions also contributed to the overall increase. Loss on disposal of assets or businesses . There were no large or unusual disposals of assets or businesses. Intangible amortization . Intangible amortization remained relatively flat. Interest expense . While our average overall outstanding debt was down by $61.3 million, or 14.9%, for the six months ending September 30, 2016 compared to the average balance outstanding for the six months ending September 30, 2015 the impact of that on interest expense was more than offset by higher average capital lease obligations for the first half of fiscal 2017 compared to the first half of fiscal 2016, which resulted in relatively flat interest expense. Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net . Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net improved from losses of $15.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015 to gains of $4.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we benefited from unrealized gains on swaps for propylene raw material of $6.6 million compared to unrealized losses of $9.5 million in the comparable period last year. In addition, a $0.7 million decrease in hedging losses were recognized compared to the prior year period, primarily in connection with realized losses on propylene material swaps. In addition, the six months ended September 30, 2015 included a loss of $0.5 million recognized for the fair value remeasurement of the Company s original investment in BaySaver at the time the Company acquired a controlling interest in July 2015, whereas there was no comparable amount in the current year period. The remainder of the change is primarily related to foreign exchange gains. Income tax expense . For the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had effective tax rates of 39.8% and 31.3%, respectively. The current year rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to state and local income taxes and non-deductible expenses, partially offset by foreign income taxed at lower rates. For the six months ended September 30, 2015, uncertain tax positions related to foreign jurisdictions were released due to the lapse of statute of limitations. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates represents our proportionate share of income or loss attributed to two unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have significant influence, but not control, over operations as well as our proportional share of BaySaver earnings up until the July 17, 2015 step acquisition. Our proportional share of BaySaver earnings was $0.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, whereas there was no comparable amount in the six months ended September 30, 2016. - 22 - Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest . Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased from $4.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016. The change is primarily attributable to a decrease in the profitability of ADS-Mexicana. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, System-Wide Net Sales, Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share and Free Cash Flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measure. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated: (a) Includes our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In addition, these amounts include our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our BaySaver Joint Venture prior to our step acquisition of BaySaver on July 17, 2015, which was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting. (b) Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of our prior period financial statements as reflected in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K and the preparation of our fiscal year 2016 Forms 10-Q and 10-K that were delayed due to the restatement. System-Wide Net Sales (Non-GAAP) . System-Wide Net Sales is a non-GAAP measure we use to measure the overall performance of our business across all of our geographies and markets we serve. Our South American Joint Venture is managed as an integral part of our International segment, and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and our BaySaver joint venture are managed as integral parts of our Domestic segment. System-Wide Net Sales is prepared as if our South American Joint Venture, our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, and our BaySaver joint venture (prior to its acquisition on July 17, 2015) were accounted for as consolidated subsidiaries for all periods. The reconciliation of our System-Wide Net Sales to Net sales is as follows: - 23 - (a) As of July 17, 2015, we increased our ownership in BaySaver to 65% and have consolidated BaySaver since that date. As such Net Sales from our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015 are included in this line item. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) . Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a non-GAAP, supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance as if all shares held by the ESOP were to be converted to common shares. This information is useful to investors as the preferred shares held by the ESOP are required to be distributed to our employees over time, which is done in the form of common stock after the conversion of the preferred shares. As such, this measure is included in this report because it provides the investors with information to understand the impact on the financial statements once all preferred shares are converted and distributed. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. We calculate Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) by adjusting Net income per share Basic, Net income available to common stockholders Basic, and Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic amounts for the conversion of all shares of Redeemable convertible preferred stock into ADS common stock at the conversion ratio of one share of redeemable convertible preferred stock for every 0.7692 share of common stock as of the beginning of each period presented. To effect this adjustment with respect to Net income available to common stockholders - Basic, we have (1) added back the accretion of Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries, (2) added back the dividends to Redeemable convertible preferred stockholders and dividends paid to unvested restricted stockholders, (3) added back the amount allocated to participating securities under the two class earnings per share computation method, and (4) added back ESOP deferred compensation attributable to the shares of Redeemable convertible preferred stock allocated to employee ESOP accounts during the applicable period, which is a non-cash charge to our earnings. We have also made adjustments to the Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic to (1) assume share conversion of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock to common stock and (2) add shares of outstanding unvested restricted stock. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP), Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding Fully Converted (Non-GAAP) and Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) to Net income available to common stockholders - Basic, Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic and Net income per share - Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures, respectively, for each of the periods indicated. - 24 - Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) . Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management and the Company s board of directors to assess the Company s ability to generate cash. Management believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our measure of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The following table presents a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to Cash flow from operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity requirements are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and dividend payments for our convertible preferred stock and common stock. We have historically funded, and expect to continue to fund, our operations primarily through internally generated cash flow, debt financings, equity issuance and capital and operating leases. From time to time, we may explore additional financing methods and other means to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. As of September 30, 2016, we had $3.3 million in cash that was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings in foreign subsidiaries with the exception of cash dividends paid by our ADS Mexicana joint venture. In the event that foreign earnings are repatriated, these amounts will be subject to income tax liabilities in the appropriate tax jurisdiction. Working Capital and Cash Flows During the six months ended September 30, 2016, our source of funds was primarily driven by operating earnings and seasonal borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. During the six months ended September 30, 2015, our source of funds was primarily driven by operating earnings, seasonal borrowings on our Revolving Credit facility, and proceeds from notes, mortgages and other debt. For both the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our use of cash was primarily driven by seasonal increases in accounts receivable and capital expenditures, as well as payments on Senior Notes for the six months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we had $132.2 million in liquidity, including $8.8 million of cash and $123.4 million in borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility, described below. We believe that our cash on hand, together with the availability of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and other financing arrangements and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, scheduled interest payments on our indebtedness and the dividend payment requirement for our convertible preferred stock for at least the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2016, we had total consolidated net indebtedness of approximately $420.2 million. This amount includes capital lease obligations and is net of cash. Working Capital . Working capital increased to $215.3 million as of September 30, 2016, from $187.4 million as of March 31, 2016, - 25 - primarily due to the increases in account receivable of $28.4 million resulting from sales increases and a decrease of $7.2 million in inventory for planned sales increases. As disclosed in Note 1, the change in working capital is also impacted by the reduction of net current deferred tax assets from $11.7 million as of March 31, 2016 to $0 as of September 30, 2016 as all deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 are now classified as non-current due to the adoption of an accounting standards update as described in Note 1. Background and Significant Accounting Policies. Operating Cash Flows. Cash flows from operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was $45.6 million as compared with cash from operating activities of $16.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015. Cash flows from operating activities during the six months ended September 30, 2016 was impacted by higher net income as a result of lower resin costs and lower working capital levels, partially offset by higher restatement costs. Investing Cash Flows. During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, cash used for investing activities was $24.4 million and $25.1 million, respectively, primarily due to capital expenditures in support of operations. Financing Cash Flows. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, cash used for financing activities was $18.8 million, due to payments on our Senior Notes, Term Loan and capital lease obligations, partially offset by increased borrowings on our Revolving Credit facility to support our typical seasonal demand increase following the winter months. During the six months ended September 30, 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $7.7 million, utilizing borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility to support our typical seasonal demand increase and proceeds from notes, mortgages, and other debt. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures totaled $23.8 million and $21.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Our capital expenditures for the six months ended September 30, 2016 were used primarily to support facility expansions, equipment replacements, our recycled resin initiatives and capitalized software. We currently anticipate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $50 million to $55 million in fiscal year 2017. Such capital expenditures are expected to be financed using funds generated by operations. As of September 30, 2016, there were no material contractual obligations or commitments related to these planned capital expenditures. Financing Transactions Bank Term Loans On September 24, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, or PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June 12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for our Bank Term Loans consisting of (i) the Revolving Credit Facility providing for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $325 million, (ii) the Term Loan Facility providing for the Term Loans in an aggregate original principal amount of $100 million, and (iii) the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility, described below, which is more fully described in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding principal drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility was $191.0 million, with $123.4 million available to be drawn on the U.S. facility. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan was $77.5 million. ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility On September 24, 2010, our joint venture ADS Mexicana entered into a credit agreement with PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June 12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $12 million. According to the terms of the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility, ADS Mexicana is not permitted to make loans to ADS, Inc. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was $2.7 million, which $9.3 million available to be drawn. Senior Notes On December 11, 2009, we entered into a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management Inc., or Prudential, which agreement, as amended and restated on September 24, 2010 and subsequently further amended, provides for the issuance by us of senior secured promissory notes to Prudential or its affiliates from time to time in the aggregate principal amount up to $100 million, which is more fully described in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A. - 26 - We have $25.0 million available for issuance of senior notes under the private shelf agreement. At September 30, 2016, the outstanding principal balance on these notes was $75.0 million. October and December 2016 Consents Related to the Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes In October 2016, the Company obtained consents from the lenders of the Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes. These consents had the effect of extending the time for delivery of our first quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly financial information to November 30, 2016 and our second quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly financial information to December 31, 2016, whereby an event of default was waived as long as those items are delivered within a 30 day grace period after those dates. In addition, the consents also permitted the Company s payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share on common shares in December 2016, as well as reaffirmed the annual dividend of $0.0195 per share to be paid on shares of preferred stock in March 2017. In December 2016, the Company obtained additional consents from the lenders of the Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes. These consents had the effect of extending the time for delivery of our first quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly financial information to January 31, 2017. Covenant Compliance Our outstanding debt agreements and instruments contain various restrictive financial covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on additional indebtedness and capital distributions, including dividend payments. The two primary debt covenants include a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio maintenance covenant. For any relevant period of determination, the Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Consolidated Indebtedness (funded debt plus guarantees) by Consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit facility. The current upper limit is 4.0 times. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of Consolidated EBITDA minus Capital Expenditures minus cash income taxes paid, by the sum of Fixed Charges. Fixed Charges include cash interest expense, scheduled principal payments on indebtedness, and ESOP capital distributions in excess of $10 million in a given fiscal year. The current minimum ratio is 1.25 times. For further information, see Note 12. Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of September 30, 2016, with the exception of the determination in December 2016 that certain intercompany loans between ADS Mexicana and ADS, Inc. had occurred between November 2014 and November 2015 that triggered an event of default according to the terms of the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility. On December 13, 2016, ADS Mexicana obtained a covenant waiver from the lenders. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Excluding the guarantee of 50% of certain debt of our unconsolidated South American Joint Venture, as further discussed in Note 4. Related Party Transactions to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangement. As of September 30, 2016, our South American Joint Venture had approximately $17.1 million of outstanding debt. We do not believe that this guarantee will have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.

Unless otherwise noted, references to year pertain to our fiscal year. For example, 2017 refers to fiscal 2017, which is the period from April1, 2016 to March31, 2017. The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) on January10, 2017. In addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. For more information, see the section below entitled Forward Looking Statements. We consolidate all of our joint ventures for purposes of GAAP, except for our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture. Overview We are the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the underground construction and infrastructure marketplace. Our innovative products are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform, our overall product breadth and scale and our manufacturing excellence. In the United States, our national footprint combined with our strong local presence and broad product offering make us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $10.8 billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity. Our products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following our entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, our pipe products have been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets. This has allowed us to consistently gain share and achieve above-market growth throughout economic cycles. We expect to continue to drive conversion to our products from traditional materials as contractors, civil design engineers and municipal agencies increasingly acknowledge the superior physical attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products. In addition, we believe that overall demand for our products will benefit as the regulatory environment continues to evolve. Our broad product line includes HDPE pipe, PP pipe and related water management products. Building on our core drainage businesses, we have aggressively pursued attractive ancillary product categories such as storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings and filters, and water quality filters and separators. We refer to these ancillary product categories as Allied Products. Given the scope of our overall sales and distribution platform, we have been able to drive growth within our Allied Products and believe there are significant growth opportunities going forward. - 17 - Results of Operations Three Months Ended December31, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended December31, 2015 The following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net sales that have been derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We believe this presentation is useful to investors in comparing historical results. Net sales. Net sales were $294.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016, decreasing $18.1 million, or 5.8%, over the comparable period in fiscal year 2016. Domestic net sales decreased $12.4 million, or 4.7%, in the three months ended December 31, 2016, over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. Our domestic pipe sales decreased by $14.1 million, or 7.2%, which was a result of both pipe volume decreases of $9.4 million and price decreases of $4.6 million. The agriculture market has experienced continued sales decreases. Allied product sales increased $1.7 million, or 2.4%. International net sales decreased $5.7 million, or 12.3%, in the three months ended December 31, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily attributable to pipe volume decreases of $2.6 million, partially offset by price increases of $1.4 million in our international markets and a decrease in Allied products sales of $3.8 million. Cost of goods sold and Gross profit. Cost of goods sold decreased by $12.7 million, or 5.3%, and gross profit decreased by $5.4 million, or 7.2%, in the three months ended December 31, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease in domestic gross profit of $6.0 million, or 9.0%, was impacted by the decrease in domestic net sales of 4.7% and higher transportation and manufacturing costs, partially offset by lower raw material costs compared to the comparable fiscal year 2016 period. International gross profit increased $0.6 million, or 6.9%, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016, largely due to the impact of lower raw material costs more than offset the impact of the decrease in international net sales of 12.3% over the comparable fiscal year 2016 period. - 18 - Selling expenses. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses were 7.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to 6.9% in the prior year. Selling expenses were essentially flat. General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2016 increased $2.3 million from the prior year period. Restatement-related costs decreased $1.2 million was offset by increased staff levels, increased use of outside consultants in various corporate functions and a decrease in the benefit from stock-based compensation of $1.4 million. Loss (gain) on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities . In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company shortened the remaining useful life of certain assets related to two manufacturing facilities resulting in accelerated depreciation expense of less than $2 million. One facility closed in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and ADS committed to a plan to reduce production at the other facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Intangible amortization . Intangible amortization remained relatively flat. Interest expense . Our average overall outstanding debt was down by $51.6 million, or 13.5%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 compared to the average balance outstanding for the quarter ended December 31, 2015. The impact of lower debt outstanding on interest expense was partially offset by higher average capital lease obligations for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2015, which resulted in lower overall interest expense in the current year period. Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net . Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net improved from losses of $2.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 to gains of $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. During the quarter ended December 31, 2016, we benefited from unrealized gains on fuel option derivatives of $0.9 million compared to unrealized losses of $0.7 million in the comparable period last year. In addition, a $1.1 million decrease in realized hedging losses was recognized compared to the prior year, primarily in connection with realized losses on propylene material swaps. Income tax expense . For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had effective tax rates of 33.8% and 42.1%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the timing of certain discrete items. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates represents our proportionate share of income or loss attributed to two unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have significant influence, but not control, over operations. The net loss increased due to our portion of the loss of inventory due to a fire as discussed in Note 3. Fair Value Measurements. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest . Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased from a loss of $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 to net income of $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The change is primarily attributable to improvement in the profitability of ADS-Mexicana. Nine Months Ended December31, 2016 Compared With Nine Months Ended December31, 2015 The following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net sales that have been derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We believe this presentation is useful to investors in comparing historical results. - 19 - Net sales. Net sales totaled $1,013.1 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2016, decreasing $32.2 million, or 3.1%, over the comparable period in fiscal year 2016. Domestic net sales decreased $13.4 million, or 1.5%, in the nine months ended December 31, 2016, over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. Our domestic pipe sales decreased by $27.6 million, or 4.2%, which was primarily a result of net price decreases of $12.6 million and decreases of $14.9 million in net volume. The agriculture market has experienced continued sales decreases. Allied product sales increased $14.2 million, or 6.0%, which included the impact of the acquisition of BaySaver, as well as increased sales volume of products sold primarily into the non-residential and infrastructure end markets. International net sales decreased $18.8 million, or 12.3%, in the nine months ended December 31, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease resulted from lower pipe volumes of $15.6 million offset by net price increases of $2.5 million in Mexico and Canada, along with a decrease of $2.5 million from a weaker Canadian dollar and Mexican Peso to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. There was also a decrease in Allied products sales. Cost of goods sold and Gross profit. Cost of goods sold decreased by $52.9 million, or 6.5%, and gross profit increased by $20.7 million, or 8.8%, in the nine months ended December 31, 2016 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in domestic gross profit of $23.7 million, or 11.6%, was primarily the result of lower raw material costs, partially offset by a decrease of sales. Growth in sales of higher margin Allied Products also contributed to the overall increase in gross profit. International gross profit decreased $3.0 million, or 9.4%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016, largely due to decreases in sales volume, partially offset by lower raw material costs. Selling expenses. Selling expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 increased $3.3 million, or 5.1% over the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in bad debt expense of $1.5 million resulting from the deterioration of certain customer accounts, as well as the investment in additional sales coverage. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses increased to 6.8% for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 6.3% in the prior year period. General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 increased $13.6 million over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses for audit, tax, legal and other professional fees related to the restatement of prior period financial statements from $16.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 to $21.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. In addition, stock-based compensation expense increased from benefit of $2.5 million for fiscal 2016 to expense of $2.6 million for fiscal 2017. Additional increases were a result of increased staff levels and increased use of outside consultants in various corporate functions. Loss (gain) on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company shortened the remaining useful life of certain assets related to two manufacturing facilities resulting in accelerated depreciation expense of less than $2 million. One facility closed in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and ADS committed to a plan to reduce production at the other facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. - 20 - Intangible amortization . Intangible amortization remained relatively flat. Interest expense . Our average overall outstanding debt was down by $39.0 million, or 10.6%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the average balance outstanding for the nine months ended December 31, 2015. The impact of lower debt outstanding on interest expense was more than offset by higher average capital lease obligations for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, which resulted in relatively flat interest expense. Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net . Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net improved from losses of $18.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 to gains of $5.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, we benefited from unrealized gains on swaps for propylene raw material of $8.0 million compared to unrealized losses of $7.4 million in the comparable period last year. In addition, a $3.8 million decrease in fuel hedging losses were recognized compared to the prior year period. In addition, the nine months ended December 31, 2015 included a loss of $0.5 million recognized for the fair value remeasurement of the Company s original investment in BaySaver at the time the Company acquired a controlling interest in July 2015, whereas there was no comparable amount in the current year period. The remainder of the change is primarily related to foreign exchange gains. Income tax expense . For the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had effective tax rates of 38.7% and 35.2%, respectively. The current year rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to state and local income taxes andnon-deductibleexpenses, partially offset by foreign income taxed at lower rates. For the nine months ended December 31, 2015, uncertain tax positions related to foreign jurisdictions were released due to the lapse of statute of limitations. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates represents our proportionate share of income or loss attributed to two unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have significant influence, but not control, over operations as well as our proportional share of BaySaver earnings up until the July 17, 2015 step acquisition. The net loss increased due to our portion of the loss of inventory due to a fire as discussed in Note 3. Fair Value Measurements. Our proportional share of BaySaver earnings was $0.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, whereas there was no comparable amount in the nine months ended December 31, 2016. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest . Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased from $4.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 to $2.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. The change is primarily attributable to a decrease in the profitability of ADS-Mexicana. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, System-Wide Net Sales, Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share and Free Cash Flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measure. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated: (a) Includes our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In addition, these amounts include our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our BaySaver Joint Venture prior to our step acquisition of BaySaver on July 17, 2015, which was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting. (b) Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of our prior period financial statements. - 21 - System-Wide Net Sales (Non-GAAP) . System-Wide Net Sales is a non-GAAP measure we use to measure the overall performance of our business across all of our geographies and markets we serve. Our South American Joint Venture is managed as an integral part of our International segment, and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and our BaySaver joint venture are managed as integral parts of our Domestic segment. System-Wide Net Sales is prepared as if our South American Joint Venture, our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, and our BaySaver joint venture (prior to its acquisition on July 17, 2015) were accounted for as consolidated subsidiaries for all periods. The reconciliation of our System-Wide Net Sales to Net sales is as follows: (a) As of July 17, 2015, we increased our ownership in BaySaver to 65% and have consolidated BaySaver since that date. As such Net Sales from our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015 are included in this line item. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) . Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a non-GAAP, supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance as if all shares held by the ESOP were to be converted to common shares. This information is useful to investors as the preferred shares held by the ESOP are required to be distributed to our employees over time, which is done in the form of common stock after the conversion of the preferred shares. As such, this measure is included in this report because it provides the investors with information to understand the impact on the financial statements once all preferred shares are converted and distributed. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. We calculate Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) by adjusting Net income per share Basic, Net income available to common stockholders Basic, and Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic amounts for the conversion of all shares of Redeemable convertible preferred stock into ADS common stock at the conversion ratio of one share of redeemable convertible preferred stock for every 0.7692 share of common stock as of the beginning of each period presented. To effect this adjustment with respect to Net income available to common stockholders - Basic, we have (1) added back the accretion of Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries, (2) added back the dividends to Redeemable convertible preferred stockholders and dividends paid to unvested restricted stockholders, (3) added back the amount allocated to participating securities under the two class earnings per share computation method, and (4) added back ESOP deferred compensation attributable to the shares of Redeemable convertible preferred stock allocated to employee ESOP accounts during the applicable periods, which is a non-cash - 22 - charge to earnings. We have also made adjustments to the Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic to (1) assume share conversion of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock to common stock and (2) add shares of outstanding unvested restricted stock. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP), Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding Fully Converted (Non-GAAP) and Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) to Net income available to common stockholders - Basic, Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic and Net income per share - Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures, respectively, for each of the periods indicated. Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) . Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management and the Company s Board of Directors to assess the Company s ability to generate cash. Management believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow does not include property, plant and equipment purchases completed through financing arrangements. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our measure of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The following table presents a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to Cash flow from operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated. - 23 - Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity requirements are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and dividend payments for our convertible preferred stock and common stock. We have historically funded, and expect to continue to fund, our operations primarily through internally generated cash flow, debt financings, equity issuance and capital and operating leases. From time to time, we may explore additional financing methods and other means to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. As of December 31, 2016, we had $6.2 million in cash that was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings in foreign subsidiaries with the exception of cash dividends paid by our ADS Mexicana joint venture. In the event that foreign earnings are repatriated, these amounts will be subject to income tax liabilities in the appropriate tax jurisdictions. Working Capital and Cash Flows As of December 31, 2016, we had $199.5 million in liquidity, including $12.1 million of cash, $162.4 million in borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility and $25.0 million under the Senior Notes, described below. We believe that our cash on hand, together with the availability of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and other financing arrangements and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, scheduled interest payments on our indebtedness and the dividend payment requirement for our convertible preferred stock for at least the next twelve months. Working Capital . Working capital decreased to $178.1 million as of December 31, 2016, from $187.4 million as of March 31, 2016, primarily due to the decreases in account receivable of $32.3 million consistent with the seasonality of our business and a decrease of $7.8 million in inventory for planned sales, offset by a decrease of $38.5 million in accounts payable and other current liabilities. As disclosed in Note 1, the change in working capital is also impacted by the reduction of net current deferred tax assets from $11.7 million as of March 31, 2016 to $0 as of December 31, 2016 as all deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2016 are now classified as non-current as result of the adoption of an accounting standard update. Operating Cash Flows. Cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 was $116.6 million as compared with cash from operating activities of $129.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2015. Cash flows from operating activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by higher net income, offset by decreases in working capital as noted above. Investing Cash Flows. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash used for investing activities was $41.4 million and $35.4 million, respectively, primarily due to capital expenditures in support of operations. Capital expenditures totaled $36.5 million and $31.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Our capital expenditures for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 were used primarily to support facility expansions, equipment replacements, various recycled resin initiatives and capitalized software. Financing Cash Flows. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, cash used for financing activities was $69.1 million, due to payments on our Senior Notes, Term loan and capital lease obligations, partially offset by decreased repayments on our Revolving Credit facility. During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $89.8 million, due to repayments of our Revolving Credit, payments of capital lease obligations and proceeds from notes, mortgages and other debt. Capital Expenditures We currently anticipate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $50 million to $55 million in fiscal year 2017. Such capital expenditures are expected to be financed using funds generated by operations. As of December 31, 2016,the Company expects to spend $20 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Financing Transactions Bank Term Loans. On September 24, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, or PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June 12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for our Bank Term Loans consisting of (i) the Revolving Credit Facility providing for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $325 million, (ii) the Term Loan Facility providing for the Term Loans in an aggregate original principal amount of $100 million, and (iii) the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility, described below, which is more fully described in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A. - 24 - As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding principal drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility was $152.0 million, with $162.4 million available to be drawn on the U.S. facility. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan was $75 million. ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility . On September 24, 2010, our joint venture ADS Mexicana entered into a credit agreement with PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June 12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $12 million. As of December 31, 2016, there was no outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility and $12 million available to be drawn. Senior Notes. On December 11, 2009, we entered into a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management Inc., or Prudential, which agreement, as amended and restated on September 24, 2010 and subsequently further amended, provides for the issuance by us of senior secured promissory notes to Prudential or its affiliates from time to time in the aggregate principal amount up to $100 million, which is more fully described in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A. We have $25 million available for issuance of senior notes under the private shelf agreement. At December 31, 2016, the outstanding principal balance on these notes was $75 million. October and December 2016 Consents Related to the Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes. In October 2016, the Company obtained consents from the lenders of the Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes. These consents had the effect of extending the time for filing of our first quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly financial information to November 30, 2016 and our second quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly financial information to December 31, 2016, whereby an event of default was waived as long as those items are delivered within a 30 day grace period after those dates. In addition, the consents also permitted the Company s payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share on common shares in December 2016, as well as reaffirmed the annual dividend of $0.0195 per share to be paid on shares of preferred stock in March 2017. In December 2016, the Company obtained additional consents from the lenders of the Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes. These consents had the effect of extending the time for delivery of our first quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly financial information to January 31, 2017. Covenant Compliance Our outstanding debt agreements and instruments contain various restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on additional indebtedness and capital distributions, including dividend payments. The two primary debt covenants include a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio maintenance covenant. For any relevant period of determination, the Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Consolidated Indebtedness (funded debt plus guarantees) by Consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit facility. The current upper limit is 4.0 times. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of Consolidated EBITDA minus Capital Expenditures minus cash income taxes paid, by the sum of Fixed Charges. Fixed Charges include cash interest expense, scheduled principal payments on indebtedness, and ESOP capital distributions in excess of $10 million in a given fiscal year. The current minimum ratio is 1.25 times. For further information, see Note 12. Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2016, with the exception of the determination in December 2016 that certain intercompany loans between ADS Mexicana and ADS, Inc. had occurred between November 2014 and November 2015 that triggered an event of default according to the terms of the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility. On December 13, 2016, ADS Mexicana obtained a covenant waiver from its lenders. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Excluding the guarantee of 50% of certain debt of our unconsolidated South American Joint Venture, as further discussed in Note 4. Related Party Transactions to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangement. As of December 31, 2016, our South American Joint Venture had approximately $16.0 million of outstanding debt. We do not believe that this guarantee will have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no changes in critical accounting policies from those disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K/A. - 25 - Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Form 10-Q ) includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of F inancial Condition and Results of Operations Unless the context otherwise indicates or requires, as used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms "we," "our," "us," "ADS" and the "Company" refer to Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. and its directly- and indirectly-owned subsidiaries as a combined entity, except where it is clear that the terms mean only Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. exclusive of its subsidiaries. Our fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, references to "year" pertain to our fiscal year. For example, 2018 refers to fiscal 2018, which is the period from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on May 30, 2017. In addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. For more information, see the section below entitled "Forward Looking Statements." We consolidate all of our joint ventures for purposes of GAAP, except for our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture. Overview We are the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the underground construction and infrastructure marketplace. Our innovative products are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform, our overall product breadth and scale and our manufacturing excellence. In the United States, our national footprint combined with our strong local presence and broad product offering make us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $11 billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity. Our products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following our entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, our pipe products have been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets. This has allowed us to consistently gain share and achieve above-market growth throughout economic cycles. We expect to continue to drive conversion to our products from traditional materials as contractors, civil design engineers and municipal agencies increasingly acknowledge the superior physical attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products. In addition, we believe that overall demand for our products will benefit as the regulatory environment continues to evolve. Our broad product line includes HDPE pipe, PP pipe and related water management products. Building on our core drainage businesses, we have aggressively pursued attractive ancillary product categories such as storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings and filters, and water quality filters and separators. We refer to these ancillary product categories as Allied Products. Given the scope of our overall sales and distribution platform, we have been able to drive growth within our Allied Products and believe there are significant growth opportunities going forward. - 21 - Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. Results of Operations Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 Compared With Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 The following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net sales that have been derived from our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. We believe this presentation is useful to investors in comparing historical results. Net sales - Net sales were $358.4million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, increasing $0.8million, or 0.2%, over the comparable period in fiscal 2017. Domestic net sales increased $6.7 million, or 2.2%, in the three months ended June 30, 2017, over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. Our domestic pipe sales increased by $2.9 million, or 1.3%, which was a result of pipe volume increase of $4.4 million offset by price decreases and changes in product mix of $2.1 million. Allied Product sales increased $3.9 million, or 4.3%. International net sales decreased $6.0 million, or 13.3%, in the three months ended June 30, 2017 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily attributable to price decreases and changes in product mix of $2.8 million, pipe volume decreases of $1.5 million and a decrease in Allied Products sales of $1.3 million. - 22 - Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. Cost of goods sold and Gross profit - Cost of goods sold increased by $10.7million, or 4.1%, and gross profit decreased by $9.9million, or 10.2%, in the three months ended June 30, 2017 over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease in domestic gross profit of $7.4 million, or 8.4%, was due to a $4.5 million increase in material costs and a $1.4 million increase in labor and overhead costs. These increased expenses were partially offset by gross profit impact of the net sales increase discussed above. The remainder of the variance is comprised of transportation and other expenses. International gross profit decreased $2.5 million, or 27.8%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, largely due to the gross profit impact of the 13.3% decrease in net sales discussed above and a $0.3 million decrease in labor and overhead costs. Selling expenses - As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses were 6.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 6.8% in the prior year. The change is primarily due to a benefit in bad debt expense in fiscal 2018 resulting from the collection of approximately $0.6 million from a Canadian customer that had previously been reserved. General and administrative expenses - General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 decreased $7.8million from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $7.0 million and a decrease in restatement related costs of $7.7 million. These decreases were offset by an increase of $5.1 million in professional fees and an increase of $1.4 million in compensation expense. On April 1, 2017 all stock options were amended and became equity classified. In the three months ended June 30, 2016, all stock options were liability-classified resulting in mark-to-market adjustments. Loss on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities - In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company shortened the remaining useful life of certain assets related to two manufacturing facilities closing in fiscal 2018 resulting in accelerated depreciation expense of approximately $2million and recorded approximately $0.6 million of severance. Intangible amortization . Intangible amortization remained relatively flat. Interest expense . Our interest expense remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales. Derivative gains and other income, net - Derivative gains and other income, net decreased by $2.1million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The majority of the Company's previous derivative contracts expired during fiscal 2017. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized a net $1.1 million gain on derivative contracts. On June 28, 2017, the company entered into an interest rate swap. The interest rate swap did not have a material impact on the Derivative gains and other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Income tax expense - For the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company had effective tax rates of 34.8% and 42.1%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the timing of certain discrete items. Equity in net (income) loss of unconsolidated affiliates - Equity in net (income) loss of unconsolidated affiliates represents our proportionate share of income or loss attributed to two unconsolidated joint ventures in which we - 23 - Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. have significant influence, but not control, over operations. The Equity in net (income) loss of unconsolidated affiliates changed to a $0.2 million income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from a $0.1 million loss for th e three months ended June 30, 2016. The change is primarily attributable to insurance recovery related to a fire that occurred in fiscal 2017 in the South American Joint Venture. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest - Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased from net income of $1.1million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 to net income of $0.7million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The change is primarily attributable to fluctuations in the profitability of ADS-Mexicana. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share and Free Cash Flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Adjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, has been presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash charges and certain other expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because it is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. In addition to covenant compliance and executive performance evaluations, we use adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure of our financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation, such as stock-based compensation expense, derivative fair value adjustments, and foreign currency transaction losses. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using adjusted EBITDA supplementally. Our measure of adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. - 24 - Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. The following table presents a rec onciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated. (1) Includes our proportional share of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization related to our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. (2) Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with our debt refinancing and asset acquisitions and dispositions. (3) Represents expenses recorded related to legal, accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of our prior period financial statements in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 expenses relate to the ongoing SEC Enforcement Division's investigation and related shareholder litigation. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share - Adjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share - Adjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share, Adjusted Net Income and Weighted Average Fully Converted Common Shares Outstanding, which are non-GAAP measures, are supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We calculate Adjusted earnings per fully converted share (Non-GAAP), Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP), and Weighted average fully converted common shares outstanding (Non-GAAP), by adjusting our Net income per share - Basic, Net income available to common stockholders - Basic and Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures. To effect this adjustment with respect to Net income available to common stockholders Basic, we have (1) removed the adjustment for the change in fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock classified as mezzanine equity, (2) added back the dividends to redeemable convertible preferred stockholders and dividends paid to unvested restricted stockholders, (3) made corresponding adjustments to the amount allocated to participating securities under the two-class earnings per share computation method, (4) added back ESOP deferred compensation attributable to the shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock allocated to employee ESOP accounts during the applicable period, which is a non-cash charge to our earnings and not deductible for income tax purposes, (5) added back the accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. We have also made adjustments to the Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic to assume (1) share conversion of the Redeemable convertible preferred stock to outstanding shares of common stock and (2) add shares of outstanding unvested restricted stock. - 25 - Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance on a per share basis assuming all shares held by the ESOP and all shares of redeem able common stock are converted to common stock. This information is useful to investors as the preferred shares held by the ESOP are required to be distributed to our employees over time, which is done in the form of common stock after the conversion of t he preferred shares. As such, this measure is included in this report because it provides the investors with information to understand the impact on the financial statements once all preferred shares are converted and distributed. Adjusted Earnings Per Ful ly Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP), Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP) and Weighted Average Fully Converted Common Shares Outstanding (Non-GAAP) to Net income (loss) per share - Basic, Net income (loss) available to common stockholders - Basic and Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures, respectively, for each of the periods indicated. - 26 - Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. Free Cash Flow - Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that comprises cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is a measure used by management and the Company's Board of Directors to assess the Company's ability to generate cash. Acco rdingly, free cash flow has been presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as a supplemental measure of liquidity that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP, because management believes that free cash flow provides useful informati on to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures. Free cash flow is not a GAAP measure of our liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our measure of free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to Cash flow from operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity requirements are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and dividend payments for our convertible preferred stock and common stock. We have historically funded, and expect to continue to fund, our operations primarily through internally generated cash flow, debt financings, equity issuance and capital and operating leases. From time to time, we may explore additional financing methods and other means to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. As of June 30, 2017, we had $4.9 million in cash that was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings in foreign subsidiaries with the exception of cash dividends paid by our ADS Mexicana joint venture. In the event that foreign earnings are repatriated, these amounts will be subject to income tax liabilities in the appropriate tax jurisdictions. Working Capital and Cash Flows As of June 30, 2017, we had $319.5 million in liquidity, including $8.7 million of cash, $285.8 million in borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility net of $11.7 million of outstanding letters of credit, and $25.0 million under the Senior Notes, described below. We believe that our cash on hand, together with the availability of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and other financing arrangements and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, scheduled interest payments on our indebtedness and the dividend payment requirement for our convertible preferred stock for at least the next twelve months. Working Capital - Working capital increased to $267.0million as of June 30, 2017, from $184.8million as of March 31, 2017, primarily due to the increase in account receivable of $46.5million consistent with the seasonality of our business and an increase of $3.8million in inventory for planned sales. Further, the change in working capital is impacted by a decrease of $14.8million attributable to the difference in timing of the payment of accounts payable,a decrease of $10.5 million of current debt obligations maturities related to the refinancing of the Secured Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes Payable, as discussed in "Note 6. Debt," and a decrease of $11.9 million due to the modification of the liability-classified stock-based awards, as further discussed in "Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation." Operating Cash Flows - Cash flows from operating activities for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was a use of $16.5 million as compared with cash used by operating activities of $0.1million for the three months ended June 30, - 27 - Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. 2016. Cash flows from operating activities during the three m onths ended June 30, 2017 was impacted by the difference in the timing of collection of receivables and the decrease in inventory spending from the comparable period. Investing Cash Flows - During the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, cash used for investing activities was $18.2million and $12.8million, respectively, primarily due to capital expenditures in support of operations. Capital expenditures totaled $17.9million and $12.6million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Our capital expenditures for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were used primarily to support facility expansions, equipment replacements, various recycled resin initiatives and capitalized software. Financing Cash Flows - During the three months ended June 30, 2017, cash provided by financing activities was $37.2million, due to increased borrowings on our Senior Notes and Revolving Credit Facility associated with the debt refinancing, which is more fully discussed in "Note 6. Debt," partially offset by increased repayments on our Revolving Credit facility and Term Loan, and $7.9 million of repurchases of our common stock under the stock repurchase program. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, cash provided by financing activities was $16.2million, due to increased borrowings on our Revolving Credit facility to support our typical seasonal demand increase following the winter months. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures totaled $17.9 million and $12.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Our capital expenditures for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were used primarily to support facility expansions, equipment replacements, our recycled resin initiatives and capitalized software. We currently anticipate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $55 million to $60 million in fiscal year 2018. Such capital expenditures are expected to be financed using funds generated by operations. As of June 30, 2017, there were no material contractual obligations or commitments related to these planned capital expenditures. Financing Transactions Secured Bank Term Loans - On September24, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, or PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for our Bank Term Loans consisting of (i)the Revolving Credit Facility providing for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $325million, (ii)the Term Loan Facility providing for the Term Loans in an aggregate original principal amount of $100million, and (iii)the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility, described below, which is more fully described in our Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K. On June 22, 2017, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with PNC, which amends and restates the agreement dated as of June 12, 2013, to provide the Company a $550 million Revolving Credit Facility, which is more fully described in "Note 6. Debt" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding principal drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility was $252.5 million, with $285.8 million available to be drawn on the U.S. facility, net of $11.7 million of outstanding letters of credit. ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility - On September24, 2010, our joint venture ADS Mexicana entered into a credit agreement with PNC, as administrative agent, and lender parties thereto. The credit agreement, as amended and restated on June12, 2013 and subsequently further amended, provides for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $12million. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding principal drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility was $0.5 million, with $11.5million available to be drawn. Senior Notes - On December11, 2009, we entered into a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management Inc., or Prudential, which agreement, as amended and restated on September24, 2010 and subsequently further amended, provides for the issuance by us of senior secured promissory notes to Prudential or its affiliates from time to time in the aggregate principal amount up to $100million, which is more fully described in our Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K. On June 22, 2017, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Private - 28 - Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. Shelf Agreement with Prud ential, which amends and restates the agreement dated as of September 24, 2010, to provide for the issuance of secured senior notes to Prudential or its affiliates from time to time in the aggregate principal amount of up to $175 million, which is more ful ly described in "Note 6. Debt" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We have $25million available for issuance of senior notes under the private shelf agreement. At June 30, 2017, the outstanding principal balance on these notes was $150mil lion. Covenant Compliance Our outstanding debt agreements and instruments contain various restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on additional indebtedness and capital distributions, including dividend payments. The two primary debt covenants of the amended ADS Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Notes include a Leverage Ratio and an Interest Coverage Ratio maintenance covenant. For any relevant period of determination, the Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Consolidated Indebtedness (funded debt plus guarantees) by Consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit facility. The current upper limit is 4.0 times (or 4.25 as of the date of any acquisitions permitted under the amended agreement for which the aggregate consideration is $100.0 million or greater). The Interest Coverage Ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of Consolidated EBITDA by consolidated interest expense. The current minimum ratio is 3.0 times. The primary debt covenant of the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility is a Leverage Ratio maintenance covenant. For any relevant period of determination, the Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Consolidated Indebtedness (funded debt plus guarantees) by Consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit facility. The current upper limit is 4.0 times. For further information, see "Note 6. Debt" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and "Note 12. Debt" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of our Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of June 30, 2017. Contractual Obligations as of June 30, 2017 (1) On June 22, 2017, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") and Second Amended and Restated Private Shelf Agreement (the "Private Shelf Agreement"). The Credit Agreement matures in June 2022. See "Note 6. Debt" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Based on applicable rates and pricing margins as of June 30, 2017. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Excluding the guarantees of 50% and 49% of certain debt of our unconsolidated South American Joint Venture and Tigre-ADS USA, respectively, as further discussed in "Note 5. Related Party Transactions" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangement. As of June 30, 2017, our South American Joint Venture and Tigre-ADS USA had approximately $15.4 million and $6.5 million, respectively, of outstanding debt. We do not believe that these guarantees will have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates With the exception of the accounting pronouncements adopted during fiscal 2018 discussed in "Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", there have been no changes in critical accounting policies from - 29 - Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. those disclosed in "Management's Discussion and Ana lysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K.
