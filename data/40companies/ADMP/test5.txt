ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
       Information Relating to Forward-Looking Statements        This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes "forward-looking" statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. These forward-looking statements include statements about our strategies, objectives and our future achievement. To the extent statements in this Quarterly Report involve, without limitation, our expectations for growth, estimates of future revenue, our sources and uses of cash, our liquidity needs, our current or planned clinical trials or research and development activities, product development timelines, our future products, regulatory matters, expense, profits, cash flow balance sheet items or any other guidance on future periods, these statements are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of word or phrases such as "believe," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "plan," and "would." These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and concern matters that could subsequently differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as may be required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date of this Report. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements are identified in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10- K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and in the other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this report as well as in other risks identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases and other communications. In addition, the statements contained throughout this Quarterly Report concerning future events or developments or our future activities, including concerning, among other matters, current or planned clinical trials, anticipated research and development activities, anticipated dates for commencement of clinical trials, anticipated completion dates of clinical trials, anticipated meetings with the FDA or other regulatory authorities concerning our product candidates, anticipated dates for submissions to obtain required regulatory marketing approvals, anticipated dates for commercial introduction of products, and other statements concerning our future operations and activities, are forward-looking statements that in each instance assume that we are able to obtain sufficient funding in the near term and thereafter to support such activities and continue our operations and planned activities in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that this will be the case. Also, such statements assume that there are no significant unexpected developments or events that delay or prevent such activities from occurring. Failure to timely obtain sufficient funding, or unexpected developments or events, could delay the occurrence of such events or prevent the events described in any such statements from occurring.        Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "our," and "the Company" refer to Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.        General        Company Overview        We  are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products in the therapeutic areas of respiratory disease and allergy. We are currently developing several products in the allergy and respiratory markets, including our Epinephrine Injection pre-filled syringe, or PFS, product for use in the emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis; albuterol (APC-2000) and fluticasone (APC-4000) Dry Powder Inhaler, or DPI, products for the treatment of bronchospasm and asthma, respectively; and beclomethasone (APC-1000), a metered dose inhaler product for the treatment of asthma. Our goal is to create low cost therapeutic alternatives to existing treatments. Consistent across all specialty pharmaceuticals product lines, we intend to submit Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications, or NDAs, or Section 505(j) Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, whenever possible, in order to potentially reduce the time to market and to save on costs, compared to those associated with Section 505(b)(1) NDAs for new drug products. Our U.S. Compounding, Inc. subsidiary, which is registered as a drug compounding outsourcing facility under Section 503B of the U.S. Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act, as amended and the U.S. Drug Quality and Security Act, or DQSA, compounds sterile prescription drugs, and certain nonsterile drugs, to patients, physician clinics, hospitals, surgery centers and other clients throughout most of the United States.          17               Epinephrine Injection USP 1:1000 0.3mg Pre-Filled Single Dose Syringe        On May 28, 2014, we submitted a Section 505(b)(2) NDA application to the FDA for approval of our Epinephrine PFS product candidate. We received a complete response letter, or CRL, from the FDA on March 27, 2015. A CRL is issued by the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research when it has completed its review of a file and questions remain that preclude the approval of the NDA in its current form. We resubmitted the NDA on December 4, 2015. On June 3, 2016, we received a second CRL from the FDA regarding our resubmitted NDA. The CRL indicated that the FDA determined that it could not approve the NDA in its present form. The agency indicated that in order to support approval of the product candidate, the Company must expand its human factors studies. The CRL indicated that new human factors studies would need to provide additional, adequate and satisfactory data and information concerning, among other things, use of the product candidate in different use environments and by different kinds of users and user groups. The CRL included comments on certain other aspects of the product candidate and the materials and data submitted as part of the NDA. The CRL indicated that the agency had reserved comment, if any, on the proposed labeling for the product candidate until the application was otherwise approvable. The FDA indicated that the NDA will remain open until the issues identified in the CRL are resolved.       On December 15, 2016, we resubmitted our NDA to the FDA. The resubmission was intended to address the issues raised by the FDA in the June 2016 CRL. On January 19, 2017, we announced that the FDA had accepted for review our resubmitted NDA. The FDA indicated that it considered the resubmission to be a complete response to the CRL. As of the date of filing of this quarterly report, we are not aware of any additional requests by the agency for information that we have not previously responded to and provided in connection with our resubmitted NDA.    There are no assurances that the FDA will approve the resubmitted NDA and grant marketing approval for the Epinephrine PFS product candidate. If the FDA approves the NDA, we hope to receive an approval in time to permit first commercial sales to commencesometime in the third quarter of 2017, although there are no assurances that this will be the case. Under goals established in connection with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA's guidance for the review and acting on Class 2 NDA resubmissions is six months from the date of receipt of the resubmission. However, the FDA's review processes can extend beyond, and in some cases significantly beyond, anticipated completion dates due to the timing of the FDA's review process, issuance of an additional CRL, FDA requests for additional data, information, materials or clarification, difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting, FDA workload issues, extensions resulting from the submission of additional information or clarification regarding information already in the submission within the last three months of the target PDUFA date, or other reasons. As a result, the dates of regulatory approval, if obtained, and commercial introduction of our product could be delayed beyond our expectations.          18               Going Concern and Management's Plan        O ur independent registered public accounting firm has included a "going concern" explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 indicating that we have sustained substantial losses from continuing operations and have used, rather than provided, cash in our continuing operations, and incurred recurring losses from operations and have limited working capital to pursue our business alternatives. As of March 31, 2017, we had cash of approximately $1.4 million, including approximately $1.0 million in restricted cash, an accumulated deficit of approximately $94.2 million, and liabilities of approximately $12.8 million. As noted below under the heading "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and in Note 11 to the financial statements appearing elsewhere herein, in April 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of shares of common stock resulting in estimated net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, of approximately $16.1 million. However, we will need significant funding to continue operations, satisfy our obligations and fund the future expenditures that will be required to conduct the clinical and regulatory work to develop and launch our product candidates. Such additional funding may not be available, may not be available on reasonable terms, and could result in significant additional dilution to our stockholders. If we do not obtain required additional equity or debt funding, our cash resources will be depleted and we could be required to materially reduce or suspend operations, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, stock price and our relationships with third parties with whom we have business relationships, at least until additional funding is obtained.       The above conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for the three months ended March 31, 2017, were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities during the normal course of business. In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, consideration was given to our future business as described elsewhere herein, which may preclude us from realizing the value of certain assets. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Without additional funds from debt or equity financing, sales of assets, sales or out-licenses of intellectual property or technologies, or from a business combination or a similar transaction, after expenditure of our existing cash resources we would exhaust our resources and would be unable to continue operations.        O ur management intends to attempt to secure additional required funding through equity or debt financings, sales or out-licensing of intellectual property assets, seeking partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies or third parties to co-develop and fund research and development efforts, or similar transactions, and through revenues from sales of compounded sterile formulations. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any required additional funding. If we are unsuccessful in securing funding from any of these sources, we will defer, reduce or eliminate certain planned expenditures, delay development or commercialization of some or all of our products and reduce the scope of our operations. If we do not have sufficient funds to continue operations, we could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or other alternatives that could result in our stockholders losing some or all of their investment in us.         19               Results of Operations        Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016        Revenues. Revenues were approximately $3,038,000 and $0 for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in revenue was due entirely to revenues from sales of compounded pharmaceutical drugs by our U.S. Compounding, Inc. subsidiary, which we acquired in April 2016.      Cost of Sales. Cost of sales was approximately $1,665,000 and $0 for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We did not incur any cost of sales for the three month period ended March 31, 2016, as the acquisition of USC was completed in April 2016.       Research and Development Expenses. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities are recorded as an asset and are expensed when the research and development activities are performed. Research and development costs were approximately $1,510,000 and $3,401,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to a reduction of approximately $2,168,000 in development costs of our product candidates, including our Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) products, Epinephrine PFS, APC 2000, APC 100, and TeloBVax product candidates. This amount was offset by an increase of approximately $198,000 in development costs attributed to the APC 1000 product candidate, and by an increase of approximately $9,000 in research and development expenditures relating to compounded formulation drugs, consulting and regulatory expenses. Compensation expense increased approximately $70,000 during the three month period compared to the first quarter of 2016 due to the hiring of additional employees and an increase in options expense.        Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. S elling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of depreciation and amortization, legal fees, accounting and audit fees, professional/consulting fees and employee compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, were approximately $5,573,000 and $2,616,000, respectively. The increase was primarily due to approximately $3,080,000 of expenses relating to USC which we acquired in April 2016, after the end of our first quarter ended March 31, 2016. Expenses related to the commercialization activities of the Epinephrine PFS product candidate decreased by approximately $208,000 for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the comparable period of 2016. Compensation expense for General and Administrative employees increased by approximately $164,000 for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, compared to the comparable period of 2016, primarily due to salary increases, stock options granted and monthly accrual of bonus. Other increases in expenditures for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the comparable quarter of 2016 included increases of approximately $93,000 for insurance and increases in finance and accounting related expenses, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $172,000 in expenses related to business development, IT consulting, legal and patent expenses, taxes, directors and executive expenses, selling and commercial operation travel and office expenses.        Other Expense. O ther Expense for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, was approximately $63,000 and $391,000, respectively. Other Expense consists primarily of interest expense, change in fair value of warrants and change in fair value of derivative liabilities. The reduction in other expenses was primarily due to the exercise and cancellation of warrants and derivatives in 2016 which account for the approximately $391,000 expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016, partially offset by the debt related expense (Interest Expense) of approximately $67,000 for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 and approximately $0 for the comparable period in 2016. The increase in debt related expenses for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, compared to the comparable period in 2016 was due to interest payments related to the working capital loan in the principal amount of $2.0 million and other bank liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of USC in April 2016.         20               Liquidity and Capital Resources        We have incurred net losses of approximately $5.8 million and $6.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Since inception, and through March 31, 2017, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $94.2 million. Since inception and through March 31, 2017, we have financed operations principally through debt financing, through private issuances of common stock and preferred stock, and through public offerings of common stock. We have primarily devoted our resources for general corporate purposes, which have included funding for research and development, selling, general and administrative expenses, working capital, reducing indebtedness, pursuing and completing acquisitions or investments in other businesses, products or technologies, and for capital expenditures. In April 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 4,928,572 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $3.50 per share, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, of approximately $16.1 million. As part of our acquisition of USC in April of 2016, we assumed debt of approximately $5.7 million and entered into a secured $2 million line of credit agreement. We expect to finance future cash needs primarily through proceeds from equity or debt financings, loans, sales of assets, out-licensing transactions, and/or collaborative agreements with corporate partners.       Total assets were approximately $33.7 million and $37.8 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Current liabilities exceed current assetsby approximately $5.3 million and $1.5 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.        Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, was approximately $3.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities decreased primarily due to the gross margin of approximately $1.4 million offset by the increase in Selling, General and Administrative expenses.      21                   Net cash used by financing activities was approximately $115,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2017, and net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $5,017,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Net cash flows provided by financing activities decreased primarily due to the issuance of common stock in January 2016 in a financing transaction that generated net proceeds of approximately $5 million.        As noted above under the heading "Going Concern and Management Plan," through March 31, 2017, Adamis had incurred substantial losses. As noted above and in Note 11 to the financial statements appearing elsewhere herein, in April 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of shares of common stock at resulting in estimated net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, of approximately $16.1 million. However, the availability of any required additional funding cannot be assured. If we do not obtain additional equity or debt funding, our cash resources will be depleted and we will be required to reduce or suspend operations. Even if we are successful in obtaining additional funding to permit us to continue operations at the levels that we desire, substantial time may pass before we obtain regulatory marketing approval for any of our product candidates and begin to realize revenues from sales of such products, and during this period Adamis will require additional funds to continue operations and development of our product candidates. No assurance can be given as to the timing or ultimate success of obtaining future funding.        As  we have previously disclosed in our SEC filings, in connection with our acquisition of USC and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement relating to the USC acquisition, we assumed approximately $5,722,000 principal amount of debt obligations under two loan agreements and related loan documents relating to the building, real property and equipment that certain third parties agreed to transfer to the Company or USC in connection with the Merger, as well as the two loan agreements to which USC is a party, a working capital loan and an equipment loan, and related loan documents evidencing loans previously made to USC, and we agreed to become an additional co-borrower under the USC Loan Documents. The lender in all of the USC Loan Documents was First Federal Bank and/or its successor Bear State Bank, referred to as Lender or the Bank. In November 2016, we entered into amendments of our loan agreements with the Bank. Under the loan agreements, we are required to make current periodic interest and principal payments under the Amended Loan Documents, in an amount of approximately $55,000 per month; the amount of required interest payments is subject to change depending on future changes in interest rates. The balances of the USC Working Capital Line, Building Loan and Equipment Loan are due and payable on September 30, 2017, August 8, 2019 and October 1, 2019, respectively. We also entered into a loan and security agreement with the Lender, referred to as the Adamis Working Capital Line, pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate of $2,000,000 to provide working capital to USC, subject to the terms and conditions of the loan agreement. Interest on amounts borrowed under the Adamis Working Capital Line accrues at a rate equal to the prime interest rate, as defined in the agreement. Interest payments are required to be made quarterly. As amended effective March 31, 2017, the entire outstanding principal balance, and all accrued and unpaid interest and all other sums payable pursuant to our loan agreement with the Bank, are due and payable on March 1, 2018, or sooner upon the occurrence of certain events as provided in the loan agreement and related documents. Our obligations under the Adamis Working Capital Line are secured by certain collateral, including without limitation our interest in amounts that we have loaned to USC; a warrant that we issued to the Lender to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to par value per share, only exercisable by Lender if we are in default under the loan documents and if the Lender delivers a notice to us and we do not cure the default within the applicable cure period; and our Certificate of Deposit (&quot;CD&quot;) with the Lender of approximately $1,000,000.     Page; Sequence: 19; Value: 2     22              Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates        The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.        The Company's critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 have not significantly changed. Refer to Note 1 to the accompanying financial statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the additional policy adopted during the three months ended March 31, 2017.        Recent Accounting Pronouncements        Recent accounting pronouncements are disclosed in Note 1 to the accompanying financial statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.        Off Balance Sheet Arrangements        At March 31, 2017, Adamis did not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
