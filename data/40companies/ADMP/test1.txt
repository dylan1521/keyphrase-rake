ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 Information Relating to Forward-Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes "forward-looking" statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. These forward-looking statements include statements about our strategies, objectives and our future achievement. To the extent statements in this Quarterly Report involve, without limitation, our expectations for growth, estimates of future revenue, our sources and uses of cash, our liquidity needs, our current or planned clinical trials or research and development activities, product development timelines, our future products, regulatory matters, expense, profits, cash flow balance sheet items or any other guidance on future periods, these statements are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of word or phrases such as "believe," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "plan," and "would." These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and concern matters that could subsequently differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as may be required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date of this Report. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements are identified in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the most recent Transition Report on Form 10- K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and in the other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this report as well as in other risks identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases and other communications. In addition, the statements contained throughout this Quarterly Report concerning future events or developments or our future activities, including concerning, among other matters, current or planned clinical trials, anticipated research and development activities, anticipated dates for commencement of clinical trials, anticipated completion dates of clinical trials, anticipated meetings with the FDA or other regulatory authorities concerning our product candidates, anticipated dates for submissions to obtain required regulatory marketing approvals, anticipated dates for commercial introduction of products, and other statements concerning our future operations and activities, are forward-looking statements that in each instance assume that we are able to obtain sufficient funding in the near term and thereafter to support such activities and continue our operations and planned activities in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that this will be the case. Also, such statements assume that there are no significant unexpected developments or events that delay or prevent such activities from occurring. Failure to timely obtain sufficient funding, or unexpected developments or events, could delay the occurrence of such events or prevent the events described in any such statements from occurring.  Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "our," and "the Company" refer to Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.  General  Company Overview  We are an emerging pharmaceutical company focused on combining specialty pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to provide innovative medicines for patients and physicians. We are currently primarily focused on our specialty pharmaceutical products. We are currently developing several products in the allergy and respiratory markets, including our Epinephrine PFS product, for the emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and a dry powder inhaler technology. Our goal is to create low cost therapeutic alternatives to existing treatments. Consistent across all specialty pharmaceuticals product lines, we intend to submit Section505(b)(2) New Drug Applications, or NDAs, or Section 505(j) Abbreviated New Drug Applications or ANDAs, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, whenever possible, in order to potentially reduce the time to market and to save on costs, compared to those associated with Section 505(b)(1) NDAs for new drug products. We also have a number of biotechnology product candidates and technologies, including therapeutic vaccine and cancer product candidates and technologies intended to treat patients with unmet medical needs in the global cancer market. To achieve our goals and support our overall strategy, we will need to raise a substantial amount of funding and make significant investments in equipment, new product development and working capital.        13                   Recent Developments  Epinephrine Injection USP 1:1000 0.3mg Pre-filled Single Dose Syringe  On May28, 2014, we submitted a Section 505(b)(2) NDA application to the FDA for approval for sale of our Epinephrine Injection USP 1:1000 0.3mg Pre-filled Single Dose Syringe, or the Epinephrine PFS product. The Epinephrine PFS product delivers a premeasured dose of epinephrine for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis.  On March 27, 2015, we issued a press release announcing that we received a Complete Response Letter ("CRL") from the FDA regarding our NDA for the Epinephrine PFS product. A CRL is issued by the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research when it has completed its review of a file and questions remain that preclude the approval of the NDA in its current form.  The questions raised by the FDA in the CRL pertained to Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls ("CMC") relating to the volume of dose delivered by the syringe, including the ability of the Epinephrine PFS product as designed and manufactured as described in the NDA to deliver volume of epinephrine within the levels contained in the labeling claim and as required by the FDA. No other safety or efficacy issues were raised, and the NDA will remain open until the CMC issues are resolved. The letter indicated that the agency had reserved comment, if any, on the proposed labeling for the product until the application was otherwise adequate.  Following receipt of the CRL, the Company has had communications with the FDA, including a telephonic meeting with the FDA on August 5, 2015, and is continuing its review of the CRL. The Company is taking a number of actions, including changes to the performance, size and functionality of the product,that the Company believes may be responsive to the items raised in the CRL, with the goal of preparing and submitting an amendment of the NDA to the FDA before the end of 2015, assuming successful and timely continued product development efforts. Under the FDA's procedures concerning target response times, the Company believes that the FDA should respond to an additional submission by the Company within six months after the Company's responsive submission, though that target deadline may be extended if FDA requests additional data, information, materials or clarification or for other reasons, such as difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting, FDA workload issues, or other reasons. The Company remains committed to attempting to obtain FDA approval of the NDA for the Epinephrine PFS product and commercializing the product, and remains hopeful that the issues and questions raised by the FDA in the CRL will be satisfactorily addressed and the product ultimately approved for marketing. However, the Company cannot provide any assurances concerning when it will make any additional submission, whether the FDA will agree that any resubmission of the NDA by the Company satisfactorily addresses the matters noted in the CRL, whether the FDA will raise other issues relating to the NDA, what actions will be required in order to satisfy the FDA's issues and questions, and whether the Epinephrine PFS product will ultimately be commercialized. In addition, the Company may be required to devote additional cash resources, which could be significant, in order to respond to the issues raised by the FDA in the CRL and any follow-up requests and to design and manufacture the Epinephrine PFS product in a manner that complies with the FDA requirements.  APC-1000  The Company is continuing development of the APC-1000 product candidate, a steroid hydrofluoroalkane, or HFA, metered dose inhaler product for asthma. Following discussions with the FDA and additional consideration of the development pathway for the product, the Company has decided to conduct additional development work for APC-1000 during 2015. As a result, the Company will likely not file an investigational new drug application, or IND, or commence a clinical study regarding APC-1000 during 2015 but intends, depending on the outcome of several factors including results of the additional development work and obtaining additional funding that will be required to commence a trial, to submit an IND for APC-1000 during the first half of 2016, although there can be no assurances concerning the timing of any such filing or the commencement of a clinical trial relating to APC-1000 after submission of such an IND.  Going Concern and Management Plan  Our independent registered public accounting firm has included a "going concern" explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the nine-month transition period ended December31, 2014 and fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 indicating that we have sustained substantial losses from continuing operations and have used, rather than provided, cash in its continuing operations, and incurred recurring losses from operations and have limited working capital to pursue our business alternatives, and that these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2015, we had cash of approximately $6.3 million, an accumulated deficit of approximately $65.4 million, and liabilities of approximately $2.2 million. We will need significant funding to continue operations, satisfy our obligations and fund the future expenditures that will be required to conduct the clinical and regulatory work to develop and launch our product candidates. Such additional funding may not be available, may not be available on reasonable terms, and could result in significant additional dilution to our stockholders. If we do not obtain required additional equity or debt funding, our cash resources will be depleted and we could be required to materially reduce or suspend operations, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, stock price and our relationships with third parties with whom we have business relationships, at least until additional funding is obtained.        14                   The above conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for the three months and nine months ended September30, 2015, were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities during the normal course of business. In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, consideration was given to our future business as described elsewhere herein, which may preclude us from realizing the value of certain assets. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of our assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Without additional funds from debt or equity financing, sales of assets, sales or out-licenses of intellectual property or technologies, or from a business combination or a similar transaction, after expenditure of our existing cash resources we would exhaust our resources and would be unable to continue operations.  Our management intends to attempt to secure additional required funding through equity or debt financings, sales or out-licensing of intellectual property assets, seeking partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies or third parties to co-develop and fund research and development efforts, or similar transactions. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any required additional funding. If we are unsuccessful in securing funding from any of these sources, we will defer, reduce or eliminate certain planned expenditures and delay development or commercialization of some or all of our products. If we do not have sufficient funds to continue operations, we could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or other alternatives that could result in our stockholders losing some or all of their investment in us.  Results of Operations  Nine Months Ended September30, 2015 and 2014  Revenues. Adamis had no revenues during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Research and Development Expenses. Our research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities are recorded as an asset and are expensed when the research and development activities are performed. Research and development costs were approximately $3,807,000 and $2,717,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the additional expense in product development, consisting mostly of expenditures related to product testing and product validation of approximately $456,000 relating to our Epinephrine PFS, APC-3000 and APC-5000 product candidates. Compensation expense, which includes salaries, stock options, employee benefits and bonus accrual, increased by approximately $596,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the comparable period of the prior year because of salary increase, new hires, additional stock option grants and monthly accrual of bonus. Travel and other expenses increased by approximately $40,000 in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the comparable period in 2014 as a result of visits to vendors.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of depreciation and amortization, legal fees, accounting and audit fees, professional/consulting fees and employee compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $7,180,000 and $3,690,000, respectively. The increase in expense was primarily due to the activities related to the anticipated commercialization of Epinephrine PFS product, including approximately $1,073,000 of expenses relating to market research, training, branding, marketing and distribution strategies and payments to third party consultants and contractors pursuant to agreements relating to the foregoing, and approximately $1,155,000 increase in compensation expense for Sales and Marketing employees, which includes salaries, stock options, employee benefits and bonus accrual. Compensation expense for General and Administrative employees increased by approximately $1,006,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the comparable period of the prior year, primarily due to salary increases, new hires, additional stock options granted and monthly accrual of bonus. Other increases in expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included increases in SEC reporting and other related expenses of approximately $67,000, board of directors' fees of approximately $169,000, insurance cost of approximately $41,000, accounting and legal expenses of approximately $55,000 and rent of approximately $69,000. These increases were partially offset bya decrease of $146,000 in amortization expense because of an asset that was fully amortized in 2014.  Other Income (Expense). Other income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $1,053,000 and approximately $(152,000), respectively. Other Income (Expense) consists primarily of a change in fair value of warrants, change in fair value of derivative liabilities, gain in extinguishment of debt, and interest expense. The net change in fair value of warrants and derivatives resulted in an income of approximately $1,053,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to income of approximately $21,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The fluctuation in the valuation of the warrants and warrant derivatives was primarily due to the drop in exercise pricefrom $5.95 to $3.40 in August 2014 and the changes in stock price, term and volatility. Debt related expense (Interest Expense and Gain in Extinguishment of Debt) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $0 and $172,000, respectively. The decrease in debt related expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, in comparison to the same period for fiscal 2014 was due to the full payment of the debt balance in 2014.        15                   Three Months Ended September30, 2015 and 2014  Revenues. Adamis had no revenues during the three month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Research and Development Expenses. Our research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities are recorded as an asset and are expensed when the research and development activities are performed. Research and development costs were approximately $1,183,000 and $598,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the additional expense in product development, consisting mostly of expenditures related to product testing and product validation of approximately $372,000 relating to our Epinephrine PFS, APC-3000 and APC-5000 product candidates. Compensation expense, which includes salaries, stock options, employee benefits and bonus accrual, increased by approximately $205,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the comparable period of the prior year because of salary increases, new hire, additional stock options granted and monthly accrual of bonus. Travel and other expenses increased by approximately $8,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the comparable period of 2014 as a result of visits to vendors.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of depreciation and amortization, legal fees, accounting and audit fees, professional/consulting fees and employee compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $2,125,000 and $1,344,000, respectively. The increase in expense was primarily due to the activities related to the anticipated commercialization of the Epinephrine PFS product candidate, including approximately $108,000 of expenses relating to market research, training, branding, marketing and distribution strategies and payments to third party consultants and contractors pursuant to agreements relating to the foregoing, and approximately $442,000 increase in compensation expense for Sales and Marketing employees, which includes salaries, stock options, employee benefits and bonus accrual. Compensation expense for General and Administrative employees increased by approximately $449,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the comparable period of the prior year, primarily due to salary increases, new hires, additional stock options granted and monthly accrual of bonus. Other increases in expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the comparable quarter in 2014 included increases in board of directors' fees of approximately $56,000.An offset to the increase in expenses was the reduction of approximately $49,000 in amortization of an asset whose value was fully amortized in 2014, a decrease in travel expenses by approximately $19,000 and a decrease in accounting and legal expenses by approximately $207,000 due to the decrease in patent costs and reduced legal activities for the three month periodended September 30, 2015 compared to the comparable period of the prior year.  Other Income (Expense). Other expense for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $159,000 and approximately $(183,000), respectively. Other Income (Expense) consists primarily of a change in fair value of warrants and change in fair value of derivative liabilities. The net change in fair value of warrants and derivatives resulted in an income of approximately $159,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the expense of approximately $183,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2014. The fluctuation in the valuation of warrants and warrant derivatives was primarily due to the drop in exercise price from $5.95 to $3.40 in August 2014 and the changes in stock price, term andvolatility.    Liquidity and Capital Resources  We have incurred net losses of approximately $9.9 million and $6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Since inception, and through September 30, 2015, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $65.4 million. Since inception and through September 30, 2015 we have financed our operations principally through debt financing, through private issuances of common stock and preferred stock, and through underwritten public offerings of common stock. Since inception, we have raised a total of approximately $71.8 million in debt and equity financing transactions, consisting of approximately $15.8 million in debt financing and approximately $56.0 million in equity financing transactions. We expect to finance future cash needs primarily through proceeds from equity or debt financings, loans, sales of assets, out-licensing transactions, and/or collaborative agreements with corporate partners. We have used the net proceeds from debt and equity financings for general corporate purposes, which have included funding for research and development, selling, general and administrative expenses, working capital, reducing indebtedness, pursuing and completing licenses, acquisitions or investments in other businesses, products or technologies, and for capital expenditures.  Total assets were approximately $14.6 million and $12.9 million as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014. All liabilities are classified as current. Current assets exceed current liabilities by approximately $4.1 million and $0.6 million as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.  Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, was approximately $8.1 million and $6.2 million, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities increased due to additional research and development costs, and increases in Selling, General & Administrative expenses.         16                  Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $10.6 million and $7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Net cash flows provided by financing activities increased primarily due to the issuance of common stock in January 2015 that generated net proceeds of approximately $10.6 million.  As noted above under the heading "Going Concern and Management Plan," through September30, 2015, Adamis had incurred substantial losses. The availability of any required additional funding cannot be assured. If we do not obtain additional equity or debt funding in the near future, our cash resources will be depleted and we will be required to materially reduce or suspend operations. Even if are successful in obtaining additional funding to permit us to continue operations at the levels that we desire, substantial time will pass before we obtain regulatory marketing approval for any products and begin to realize revenues from product sales, and during this period Adamis will require additional funds. No assurance can be given as to the timing or ultimate success of obtaining future funding. As noted under the heading Recent Developments, the Company will be required to devote additional cash resources, which could be significant, in order to respond to the issues and questions raised by the FDA in the CRL regarding our Epinephrine PFS product and to continue development of our other product candidates.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  The Company's critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in our Transition Report on Form 10-K for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2014 have not significantly changed, and no additional policies have been adopted during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenuefrom Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)." ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in "Accounting Standard Codification 605 - Revenue Recognition" and most industry-specific guidance. The standard requires that entities recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services. ASU 2014-09 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date." ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2015-14 on its consolidated financial statements.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  At September 30, 2015, Adamis did not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
