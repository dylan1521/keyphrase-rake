ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 Information Relating to Forward-Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes "forward-looking" statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. These forward-looking statements include statements about our strategies, objectives and our future achievement. To the extent statements in this Quarterly Report involve, without limitation, our expectations for growth, estimates of future revenue, our sources and uses of cash, our liquidity needs, our current or planned clinical trials or research and development activities, product development timelines, our future products, regulatory matters, expense, profits, cash flow balance sheet items or any other guidance on future periods, these statements are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of word or phrases such as "believe," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "plan," and "would." These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and concern matters that could subsequently differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as may be required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date of this Report. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements are identified in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10- K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and in the other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this report as well as in other risks identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases and other communications. In addition, the statements contained throughout this Quarterly Report concerning future events or developments or our future activities, including concerning, among other matters, current or planned clinical trials, anticipated research and development activities, anticipated dates for commencement of clinical trials, anticipated completion dates of clinical trials, anticipated meetings with the FDA or other regulatory authorities concerning our product candidates, anticipated dates for submissions to obtain required regulatory marketing approvals, anticipated dates for commercial introduction of products, and other statements concerning our future operations and activities, are forward-looking statements that in each instance assume that we are able to obtain sufficient funding in the near term and thereafter to support such activities and continue our operations and planned activities in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that this will be the case. Also, such statements assume that there are no significant unexpected developments or events that delay or prevent such activities from occurring. Failure to timely obtain sufficient funding, or unexpected developments or events, could delay the occurrence of such events or prevent the events described in any such statements from occurring.  Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "our," and "the Company" refer to Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.  General  Company Overview  We are an emerging pharmaceutical company focused on combining specialty pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to provide innovativemedicines for patients and physicians. We are currently primarily focused on our specialty pharmaceutical products. We are currently developingseveral products in the allergy and respiratory markets, including our Epinephrine PFS product, for the emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions,including anaphylaxis, and a dry powder inhaler technology. Our goal is to create low cost therapeutic alternatives to existing treatments. Consistentacross all specialty pharmaceuticals product lines, we intend to submit Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications, or NDAs, or Section 505(j)Abbreviated New Drug Applications or ANDAs, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, whenever possible, in order to potentially reducethe time to market and to save on costs, compared to those associated with Section 505(b)(1) NDAs for new drug products. We also have a number ofbiotechnology product candidates and technologies, including therapeutic vaccine and cancer product candidates and technologies intended to treatpatients with unmet medical needs in the global cancer market. To achieve our goals and support our overall strategy, we will need to raise asubstantial amount of funding and make significant investments in equipment, new product development and working capital.  Our USC subsidiary, which is registered as a drug compounding outsourcing facility under Section 503B of the U.S. Food, Drug & CosmeticAct and the U.S. Drug Quality and Security Act, provides prescription compounded medications, including compounded sterile preparations, and nonsterilecompounds to patients, physician clinics, hospitals, surgery centers and other clients throughout most of the United States. USC's productofferings broadly include, among others, corticosteroids, hormone replacement therapies, hospital outsourcing products, injectables, urologicalpreparations, ophthalmic preparations, topical compounds for pain and men's and women's health products. USC's compounded formulations in manycircumstances are offered as therapeutic alternatives to drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. USC prepares andprovides a broad range of customized stock keeping units to meet the individual requirements of customers located throughout most of the UnitedStates. USC also provides certain veterinary pharmaceutical products for animals.  Segment Information  The Company is engaged primarily in the discovery, development and sales of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other drug products.Accordingly, the Company has determined that it operates in one operating segment.            20             Recent Developments  Epinephrine Injection USP 1:1000 0.3mg Pre-filled Single Dose Syringe  On May 28, 2014, we submitted a Section 505(b)(2) NDA application to the FDA for approval for sale of our Epinephrine Injection USP 1:10000.3mg Pre-filled Single Dose Syringe, or the Epinephrine PFS product. The Epinephrine PFS product delivers a premeasured dose of epinephrine forthe emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. We received a complete response letter ("CRL") from the FDA on March27, 2015. A CRL is issued by the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research when it has completed its review of a file and questions remain thatpreclude the approval of the NDA in its current form. We resubmitted the NDA on December 4, 2015.  On June 6, 2016, we issued a press release announcing that we received a second Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding our NDAfor the Epinephrine PFS product. The CRL indicated that the FDA determined that it could not approve the NDA in its present form. The agencyindicated that in order to support approval of the product, the Company must expand its human factors study (patient usability) and reliability study(product stress testing), with new studies, with protocols to be reviewed by the FDA before commencement of the studies. The CRL indicated that thenew human factors study would need to provide additional, adequate and satisfactory data and information concerning, among other things, use of theproduct in different use environments and by different kinds of users and user groups. The CRL included comments on certain other aspects of theproduct and the materials and data submitted as part of the NDA. The CRL indicated that the agency had reserved comment, if any, on the proposedlabeling for the product until the application was otherwise adequate. The FDA indicated that the NDA will remain open until the issues identified inthe CRL are resolved.  The Company is continuing to review the CRL and actions that may be responsive to the items raised in the CRL. The Company has been in communication with the FDA regarding the CRL and plans to prepare and submit a response tothe FDA that will be intended to address the items raised in the CRL. Under the FDA's procedures concerning target response times, the Company believes that theFDA should respond to the Company's additional submission within six months after the Company's responsive submission, though that targetdeadline may be extended if FDA requests additional data, information, materials or clarification or for other reasons, such as difficulties scheduling anadvisory committee meeting, FDA workload issues, or other reasons. The Company remains committed to attempting to obtain FDA approval of theNDA for the Epinephrine PFS product and commercializing the product, and remains hopeful that the issues and questions raised by the FDA in theCRL will be satisfactorily addressed and the product ultimately approved for marketing. However, the Company cannot provide any assurancesconcerning if or when the NDA will be approved and whether the Epinephrine PFS product will ultimately be commercialized. In addition,the Company will be required to devote additional cash resources, which could be significant, in order to respond to the issues raised by the FDA in theCRL and any follow-up requests and to design and manufacture the Epinephrine PFS product in a manner that is satisfactory to the FDA.  APC-1000  The Company is continuing development of the APC-1000 product candidate, a steroid hydrofluoroalkane, or HFA, metered dose inhalerproduct for asthma. Following discussions with the FDA and additional consideration of the development pathway for the product, the Company hasdecided to conduct additional development work for APC-1000. As a result, the Company intends, depending on the outcome of several factorsincluding results of the additional development work and obtaining additional funding that will be required to commence a trial, to submit an IND forAPC-1000 during the first half of 2017, although there can be no assurances concerning the timing of any such filing or the commencement of aclinical trial relating to APC-1000 after submission of such an IND.  Termination of License Agreements Relating to Vaccine and Cancer Technologies    As has been disclosed in the Company's previous filings, the Company has previously entered into a number of license agreements pursuant to which the Company has acquired license rights regarding patent rights relating to a number of potential therapeutic vaccine and cancer product candidate technologies. In April 2010, the Company acquired rights as licensee under three exclusive license agreements (the "WARF Agreements") with the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation ("WARF") regarding certain prostate cancer technologies and product candidates, named APC-100, APC-200 and APC-300. In April 2011, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement (the "UC/DF Agreement") with The Regents of the University of California ("UCSD") and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc. ("DFCI"), pursuant to which the Company licensed certain patent rights relating to a telomerase-based cancer vaccine technology.  The Company has also disclosed in its previous filings that it is currently primarily focused on its specialty pharmaceutical products and compounding pharmacy operations and does not intend to devote material financial resources for research and development of its licensed cancer and biotechnology product candidates and technologies.  On November 10, 2016, the Company delivered a notice of termination to UCSD and DFCI of the UC/DF Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the notice of termination is effective 90 days after delivery. Also on November 10, 2016, the Company delivered a notice of termination to WARF of the WARF Agreements, which such termination to be effective 90 days after delivery of the notice. These agreements permit either party to terminate the agreements upon prior notice to the other party, without termination fees or penalties. As a result of termination of these agreements, the Company will not be responsible after the effective date of termination for minimum annual payments under the agreements or for payment of patent-related fees and costs relating to the licensed patents and technologies. As part of the winding up and termination process, the Company is responsible for certain expenses and costs incurred through the effective date of termination, and certain provisions of the agreements survive the termination or expiration of the agreements.  Going Concern and Management Plan  Our independent registered public accounting firm has included a "going concern" explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidatedfinancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the nine-month transition period ended December 31, 2014 indicating that we have sustained substantial losses from continuing operationsand have used, rather than provided, cash in its continuing operations, and incurred recurring losses from operations and have limited working capitalto pursue our business alternatives, and that these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016,we had cash of approximately $8,811,000, including the $1.0 million in restricted cash, an accumulated deficit of approximately $87.8 million, and liabilities of approximately $12.0 million. Evenwith the proceeds from our July 2016 private placement financing transaction and our registered direct offering of shares of common stock andwarrants, we will need significant funding to continue operations, satisfy our obligations and fund the future expenditures that will be required toconduct the clinical and regulatory work to develop our product candidates and to support our other activities. Such additional funding may not beavailable, may not be available on reasonable terms, and could result in significant additional dilution to our stockholders. If we do not obtain requiredadditional equity or debt funding, our cash resources will be depleted and we could be required to materially reduce or suspend operations, whichwould likely have a material adverse effect on our business, stock price and our relationships with third parties with whom we have businessrelationships, at least until additional funding is obtained.  The above conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statementsincluded elsewhere herein for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were prepared under the assumption that we would continue ouroperations as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities during the normal course of business. Inpreparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, consideration was given to our future business as described elsewhere herein, which maypreclude us from realizing the value of certain assets. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments thatmay result from the outcome of this uncertainty. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of our assets and the satisfaction of liabilities inthe normal course of business. Without additional funds from debt or equity financing, sales of assets, sales or out-licenses of intellectual property ortechnologies, or from a business combination or a similar transaction, after expenditure of our existing cash resources we would exhaust our resourcesand would be unable to continue operations.  Our management intends to attempt to secure additional required funding through equity or debt financings, sales or out-licensing of intellectualproperty assets, seeking partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies or third parties to co-develop and fund research and development efforts, orsimilar transactions. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any required additional funding. If we are unsuccessful insecuring funding from any of these sources, we will defer, reduce or eliminate certain planned expenditures and delay development orcommercialization of some or all of our products. If we do not have sufficient funds to continue operations, we could be required to seek bankruptcyprotection or other alternatives that could result in our stockholders losing some or all of their investment in us.           21           Results of Operations  Nine Months Ended September30, 2016 and 2015  Revenues  Revenues were approximately $4,004,000 and $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, consist of and reflect our acquisition of USC effective April 11, 2016, but do not include revenues of USC before the closing date of the acquisition. Revenues for the nine-month period were adversely affected by the suspension of USC's sterile compounded formulations, product recall and remediation efforts in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. USC resumed production and sales of compounded sterile formulations in March and April 2016. The suspension of production and sales of compounded sterile formulations adversely affected USC's relationships with certain of its customers and with certain of USC's independent contractors and sales representatives, and is expected to continue to adversely affect sales of compounded sterile formulations.   Cost of Sales  Cost of sales were approximately $3,167,000 and $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We did not incur any cost of sales for the nine-month period of 2015, as we did not have any revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, and our acquisition of USC was completed in April 2016. The cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was affected by an obsolescence expense of approximately $182,000 as a result of a surplus in production of sterile products in mid-March to April 2016, when USC resumed the production of sterile products, in anticipation of a larger number of customer orders following the resumption of sterile production than actually occurred before the products became obsolete. Moreover, some chemicals in inventory intended for sterile products had expired before the chemicals could be used. Our cost of sales includes direct and indirect costs to manufacture formulations and sell products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, personnel costs, packaging, storage, shipping and handling costs, the write-off of obsolete inventory and other related expenses.   Research and Development Expenses  Our research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities are recorded as an asset and are expensed when the research and development activities are performed. Research and development costs were approximately $8,325,000 and $3,807,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the additional expense in product development, consisting mostly of expenditures related to product testing and product validation of approximately $4,422,000 relating to our Epinephrine PFS, APC-2000, APC-5000, and APC 100 product candidates and an initial trial relating to a veterinary product candidate, and an increase in regulatory fees. These amounts were somewhat offset by a reduction in development costs for our APC 3000, APC 1000 and TeloB-VAX product candidates of approximately $548,000. Compensation expense, which includes salaries, stock options, employee benefits and bonus accrual, increased by approximately $605,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable period of the prior year, primarily as a result of salary increases and additional options granted.   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of depreciation and amortization, legal fees, accounting and audit fees, professional/consulting fees and employee compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $12,535,000 and $7,180,000, respectively. The increase was primarily due to expenses of approximately $5,403,000 relating to our USC subsidiary which we acquired in April 2016, including acquisition related expenses. Expenses related to the commercialization activities of our Epinephrine PFS product candidate decreased by approximately $686,000 for the first nine months of the year compared to the comparable period of 2015. Compensation expense for General and Administrative employees increased by approximately $537,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable period of the prior year, primarily due to salary increases, additional stock options granted and monthly accrual of bonus. Other increases in expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included increases of approximately $100,000 for insurance, board of directors' fees and an increase in legal, accounting recruitment, SEC reporting fees, travel and other expenses.   Other Income (Expense)  Other income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $1,256,000 and approximately $1,053,000, respectively. Other Income (Expense) consists primarily of a change in fair value of warrants, change in fair value of derivative liabilities, and interest expense. The net change in fair value of warrants and derivatives resulted in an income of approximately $1,397,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to income of approximately $1,053,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The fluctuation in the valuation of the warrants and warrant derivatives was primarily due to the changes in stock price, term and volatility. Debt related expense (Interest Expense) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $143,000 and $0, respectively. The increase in debt related expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, in comparison to the same period for fiscal 2015 was due to the working capital loan of $2.0 million and other bank liabilities assumed in relation to the acquisition of USC in April 2016.            22             Three Months Ended September30, 2016 and 2015  Revenues  Revenues were approximately $2,076,000 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, consist of and reflect our acquisition of USC effective April 11, 2016, and only include revenues of USC for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016. Revenues for the three-month period were adversely affected by the suspension of USC's sterile compounded formulations, product recall and remediation efforts in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. USC resumed production and sales of compounded sterile formulations in March and April 2016. The suspension of production and sales of compounded sterile formulations adversely affected USC's relationships with certain of its customers and with certain of USC's independent contractors and sales representatives, and is expected to continue to adversely affect sales of compounded sterile formulations.   Cost of Sales  Cost of sales were approximately $1,821,000 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We did not incur any cost of sales for the three-month period of 2015, as we did not have any revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, and our acquisition of USC was completed in April 2016. The cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was affected by an obsolescence expense of approximately $153,000 as a result of a surplus in production of sterile products in mid-March to April 2016, when USC resumed the production of sterile products, in anticipation of a larger number of customer orders following the resumption of sterile production than actually occurred before the products became obsolete. Moreover, some chemicals in inventory intended for sterile products had expired before the chemicals could be used. Our cost of sales includes direct and indirect costs to manufacture formulations and sell products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, personnel costs, packaging, storage, shipping and handling costs, the write-off of obsolete inventory and other related expenses.   Research and Development Expenses  Our research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities are recorded as an asset and are expensed when the research and development activities are performed. Research and development costs were approximately $1,494,000 and $1,183,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the additional expense in product development, consisting mostly of expenditures related to product testing and product validation of approximately $230,000. Compensation expense, which includes salaries, stock options, employee benefits and bonus accrual, increased by approximately $63,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable period of the prior year because of salary increases, additional stock options granted and monthly accrual of bonus.   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of depreciation and amortization, legal fees, accounting and audit fees, professional/consulting fees and employee compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $5,335,000 and $2,125,000, respectively. The increase was primarily due to expenses related with our USC subsidiary that we acquired during the second quarter of 2016, of approximately $3,057,000. Expenses related to the anticipated commercialization of the Epinephrine PFS product candidate decreased approximately $84,000 compared to the comparable period of the prior year. Compensation expense for General and Administrative employees increased by approximately $93,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable period of the prior year, primarily due to salary increases, additional stock options granted and monthly accrual of bonus. Other increases in expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable quarter in 2015 included USC acquisition related and other expenses of approximately $106,000 and increase of approximately $113,000 in relation to legal, accounting, recruitment, SEC reporting fees, board of directors' fees, and patent expenses, which were somewhat offset by a reduction of approximately $75,000 in consulting and other expenses.  Other Income (Expense)  Other income (expense) for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately ($69,000) and approximately $159,000, respectively. Other Income (Expense) consists primarily of a change in fair value of warrants and change in fair value of derivative liabilities. The net change in fair value of warrants and derivatives resulted in an income of $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an income of approximately $159,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $70,000 and $0. The increase in debt related expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, in comparison to the same period for fiscal 2015 was due to the working capital loan of $2.0 million and other bank liabilities assumed in relation to the acquisition of USC in April 2016.         23         Liquidity and Capital Resources  We have incurred net losses of approximately $18.8 million and $9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Since inception, and through September 30, 2016, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $87.8 million. Since inception and through September 30, 2016 we have financed our operations principally through debt financing, through private issuances of common stock and preferred stock, and through underwritten public offerings of common stock. Since inception, we have raised a total of approximately $95 million in debt and equity financing transactions, consisting of approximately $17.8 million in debt financing and approximately $77.2 million in equity financing transactions. We expect to finance future cash needs primarily through proceeds from equity or debt financings, loans, sales of assets, out-licensing transactions, and/or collaborative agreements with corporate partners. We have used the net proceeds from debt and equity financings for general corporate purposes, which have included funding for research and development, selling, general and administrative expenses, working capital, reducing indebtedness, pursuing and completing licenses, acquisitions or investments in other businesses, products or technologies, and for capital expenditures.  Total assets were approximately $36.7 million and $12.0 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. All liabilities are classified as current. Current assets exceeded current liabilities by approximately $1.9 million at September 30, 2016. Current assets exceeded current liabilities by approximately $1.4 million as of December 31, 2015.  Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was approximately $17.9 million and $8.1 million, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities increased due to additional research and development costs, and increases in selling, general &amp; administrative expenses.  Net cash provided by investing activities was approximately $365,000 and $0 for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net cash provided by investing activities increased due to the cash received from the acquisition of USC.  Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $21.2 million and $10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash flows provided by financing activities increased primarily due to the issuance of common stock, preferred stock and proceeds of a bank loan in 2016 that generated net proceeds of approximately $22 million, and an offset of approximately $1.0 million of restricted cash for the certificate of deposit held as collateral by the bank.  As noted above under the heading "Going Concern and Management Plan," through September 30, 2016, Adamis had incurred substantial losses. The availability of any required additional funding cannot be assured. If we do not obtain additional equity or debt funding in the near future, our cash resources will be depleted and we will be required to materially reduce or suspend operations. Even if we are successful in obtaining additional funding to permit us to continue operations at the levels that we desire, substantial time will pass before we obtain regulatory marketing approval for any products and begin to realize revenues from product sales, and during this period Adamis will require additional funds. No assurance can be given as to the timing or ultimate success of obtaining future funding. As noted under the heading Recent Developments, the Company will be required to devote additional cash resources, which could be significant, in order to respond to the issues and questions raised by the FDA in the CRL regarding our Epinephrine PFS product and to continue development of our other product candidates including APC-1000 and APC-5000, and to support our other operations and activities.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  The Company's critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 have not significantly changed except for the following policies that have been adopted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenues when all of the following criteria have been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues from our USC subsidiary consist of sales of compounded drugs for humans and animals, including sterile injectable and non-sterile integrative therapies. Sales discounts and rebates are sometimes offered to customers if specified criteria are met. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns, which are established at the time of sale.   Cost of Sales  Our cost of sales includes direct and indirect costs to manufacture formulations and sell products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, personnel costs, packaging, storage, royalties, shipping and handling costs, the write-off of obsolete inventory and other related expenses.             24          A ccounts Receivable Accounts receivable are reported at the amount management expects to collect on outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and credit to allowance for doubtful accounts. Uncollectible amounts are based on USC's history of past write-offs and collections and current credit conditions.  Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The cost of inventories are determined using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Inventories consist of compounding formulation raw materials, currently marketed products, and device supplies. A reserve for obsolescence is recorded monthly based on a percentage of raw materials and finished goods inventory. Acquisitions and Intangibles The Company has engaged in business combination activity. The accounting for business combinations requires management to make judgments and estimates of the fair value of assets acquired, including the identification and valuation of intangible assets, as well as liabilities assumed. Such judgments and estimates directly impact the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with each acquisition, as goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of its net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets  Goodwill, which has an indefinite useful life, represents the excess of purchase consideration over fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur indicating the potential for impairment. During its goodwill impairment review, the Company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the overall financial performance of the Company. If, after assessing the totality of these qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then no additional assessment is deemed necessary. Otherwise, the Company proceeds to perform the two-step test for goodwill impairment. The first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of loss, which involves comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill. The Company may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in a period and elect to proceed to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets with definite lives, such as property and equipment, acquired technology, customer relationships, patent and license rights, for impairment by considering competition by products prescribed for the same indication, the likelihood and estimated future entry of non-generic and generic competition with the same or similar indication and other related factors. The factors that drive the estimate of the life are often uncertain and are reviewed on a periodic basis or when events occur that warrant review. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the assets' book value to future net undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. Claims Liabilities USC is self-insured up to certain limits for health insurance. Provisions are made for both the estimated liabilities for known claims as incurred and estimates for those incurred but not reported. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was self-insured for up to the first $40,000 of claims per covered person with an aggregate deductible of $766,497.  Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax basis of such assets and liabilities. The Company maintains a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty regarding the future realization of such assets, which is based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Until such time as the Company can demonstrate that it will no longer incur losses, or if the Company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, it could be required to maintain the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.         25          Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  ASU No. 2016-15 is intended to provide guidance to eight specific cash flow issues. The amendments have been issued as an improvement to GAAP because they provide guidance for each of the eight issues, thereby reducing the current and potential future diversity in practice described above. The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim fiscal periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We do not expect adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 to have a significant impact on our financial statements.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At September 30, 2016, Adamis did not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
