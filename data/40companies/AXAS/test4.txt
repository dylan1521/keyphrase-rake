Basis of Presentation  The accounting policies followed by Abraxas Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") are set forth in the notes to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on March 16, 2017. Such policies have been continued without change. Also, refer to the notes to those financial statements for additional details of the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. All material items included in those notes have not changed except as a result of normal transactions in the interim, or as disclosed within this report. The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have not been audited by our independent registered public accountants, and in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations. Any and all adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. Although management believes the unaudited interim related disclosures in these condensed consolidated financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The results of operations and the cash flows for the period ended March31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein should be read in conjunction with the consolidated audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Consolidation Principles  The terms "Abraxas," "Abraxas Petroleum," "we," "us," "our" or the "Company" refer to Abraxas Petroleum Corporation and all of its subsidiaries, including Raven Drilling, LLC ("Raven Drilling").  Rig Accounting  In accordance with SEC Regulation S-X, no income is to be recognized in connection with contractual drilling services performed in connection with properties in which the Company or its affiliates hold an ownership, or other economic interest. Any income not recognized as a result of this limitation is to be credited to the full cost pool and recognized through lower amortization as reserves are produced.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Recently Adopted and New Accounting Standards and Disclosures In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which changes the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is deemed to be a business. Determining whether a transferred set constitutes a business is important because the accounting for a business combination differs from that of an asset acquisition. The definition of a business also affects the accounting for dispositions. Under the new standard, when substantially all of the fair value of assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset, or a group of similar assets, the assets acquired would not represent a business and business combination accounting would not be required. The new standard may result in more transactions being accounted for as asset acquisitions rather than business combinations. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and shall be applied prospectively. It is not anticipated that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.  In August 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent  10 consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. It is not anticipated that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 " Leases, " which supersedes ASC 840 "Leases " and creates a new topic, ASC 842 "Leases." This update requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. The update also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. This update will be applied using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the effect of this update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. It is not anticipated that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.  I n May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The objective of ASU 2014-09 is greater consistency and comparability across industries by using a five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. ASU 2014-09 also contains some new disclosure requirements under GAAP. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date . ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year, making it effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. In 2016, the FASB issued additional accounting standards updates to clarify the implementation guidance of ASU 2014-09. Through March2017, the Company made progress in identifying contracts for review and evaluating the new disclosure requirements.The Company expects to complete its evaluations of the impacts of the accounting and disclosure requirements on its business processes, controls and systems in the second half of 2017, and will continue to evaluate guidance from accounting regulatory agencies as it becomes available.  Stock-Based Compensation andOption Plans  Stock Options  The Company currently utilizes a standard option-pricing model (i.e., Black-Scholes) to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors.  The following table summarizes the Company's stock-based compensation expense related to stock options for the periods presented:  The following table summarizes the Company's stock option activity for the three months ended March31, 2017 (shares in thousands):   11 As of March31, 2017 , there was approximately $2.6 million of unamortized compensation expense related to outstanding stock options that will be recognized in 2017 through 2020.  Restricted Stock Awards  Restricted stock awards are awards of common stock that are subject to restrictions on transfer and to a risk of forfeiture if the awardee terminates employment with the Company prior to the lapse of the restrictions. The fair value of such stock was determined using the closing price on the grant date and compensation expense is recorded over the applicable vesting periods.  The following table summarizes the Company's restricted stock activity for the three months ended March31, 2017 :  The following table summarizes the Company's stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock for the periods presented:  As of March31, 2017 , there was approximately $1.6 million of unamortized compensation expense relating to outstanding restricted shares that will be recognized in 2017 through 2020.  Oil and Gas Properties  The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties.Under this method, all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with acquisition of properties and successful as well as unsuccessful exploration and development activities are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization of capitalized oil and gas properties and estimated future development costs, excluding unproved properties, are based on the unit-of-production method based on proved reserves.Net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, less related deferred taxes, are limited by country, to the lower of unamortized cost or the cost ceiling, defined as the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves based on unescalated prices discounted at 10% , plus the cost of properties not being amortized, if any, plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, if any, less related income taxes. Costs in excess of the present value of estimated net revenue from proved reserves discounted at 10% are charged to proved property impairment expense.No gain or loss is recognized upon sale or disposition of oil and gas properties for full cost accounting companies with proceeds accounted for as an adjustment of capitalized cost. An exception to this rule occurs when the adjustment to the full cost pool results in a significant alteration of the relationship between capitalized cost and proved reserves. The Company applies the full cost ceiling test on a quarterly basis on the date of the latest balance sheet presented. At March31, 2016 our net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceeded the present value of our estimated proved reserves by approximately $35.1 million , resulting in the recognition of an impairment for the three months of $35.1 million . At March31, 2017 , our net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties did not exceed the cost ceiling of our estimated proved reserves. Impairment calculations did not consider the impact of our commodity derivative positions as generally accepted accounting principles only allow the inclusion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. Further write-downs in subsequent quarters are reasonably likely to occur if the trailing 12-month commodity prices fall as compared to the commodity prices used in prior quarters.   12 Restoration, Removal and Environmental Liabilities  The Company is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require the Company to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum substances at various sites.Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending on their future economic benefit.Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future economic benefit are expensed.  Liabilities for expenditures of a non-capital nature are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remediation is probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are generally undiscounted unless the timing of cash payments for the liability or component is fixed or reliably determinable.  The Company accounts for future site restoration obligations based on the guidance of ASC 410 which addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. ASC 410 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset's retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its then present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. For all periods presented, we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in our full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  The following table summarizes the Company's future site restoration obligation transactions for the three months ended March31, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016:  2.Income Taxes  The Company records income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  For the three months ended March31, 2017 , there was no income tax benefit due to net operating loss carryforwards and recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred taxes.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of March31, 2017 , the Company did not have any accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The tax years 2012  through 2016 remain open to examination by the tax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.  At December 31, 2016, the Company had, subject to the limitation discussed below, $230.5 million of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes.The loss carryforward will expire in varying amounts through 2036, if not utilized.  Uncertainties exist as to the future utilization of the operating loss carryforwards. Therefore, the Company has established a valuation allowance of $103.7 million for deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016.  3. Long-Term Debt  The following is a description of the Company's debt as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively:  13   Credit Facility  The Company has a senior secured credit facility with Soci t  G n rale, as administrative agent and issuing lender, and certain other lenders, which we refer to as the credit facility.As of March31, 2017 , $18.0 million was outstanding under the Credit Facility.  The credit facility has a maximum commitment of $300.0 million and availability is subject to a borrowing base. At March31, 2017 , we had a borrowing base of $115.0 million . The borrowing base is determined semi-annually by the lenders based upon our reserve reports, one of which must be prepared by our independent petroleum engineers and one of which may be prepared internally. The amount of the borrowing base is calculated by the lenders based upon their valuation of our proved reserves securing the facility utilizing these reserve reports and their own internal decisions. In addition, the lenders, in their sole discretion, are able to make one additional borrowing base redetermination during any six-month period between scheduled redeterminations and we are able to request one redetermination during any six-month period between scheduled redeterminations. Outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid immediately or we must pledge additional oil and gas properties or other assets as collateral. We do not currently have any substantial unpledged assets and we may not have the financial resources to make any mandatory principal payments. In addition, a reduction of the borrowing base could also cause us to fail to be in compliance with the financial covenants described below. The borrowing base will be automatically reduced in connection with any sales of producing properties with a market value of 5% or more of our then-current borrowing base and in connection with any hedge termination which could reduce the collateral value by 5% or more. Our borrowing base can never exceed the $300.0 million maximum commitment amount.Outstanding amounts under the credit facility bear interest (a) at any time an event of default exists, at 3% per annum plus the amounts set forth below, and (b) at all other times, at the greater of (x) the reference rate announced from time to time by Soci t  G n rale, (y) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% , and (z) a rate determined by Soci t  G n rale as the daily one-month LIBOR plus, in each case, (b) 0.75% - 1.75% , depending on the utilization of the borrowing base, or, if we elect, LIBOR plus, in each case, 1.75% - 2.75% depending on the utilization of the borrowing base. At March31, 2017 , the interest rate on the credit facility was approximately 2.73% assuming LIBOR borrowings.  Subject to earlier termination rights and events of default, the stated maturity date of the credit facility is June30, 2018 . Interest is payable quarterly on reference rate advances and not less than quarterly on LIBOR advances. We are permitted to terminate the credit facility and are able, from time to time, to permanently reduce the lenders' aggregate commitment under the credit facility in compliance with certain notice and dollar increment requirements.  Each of our subsidiaries has guaranteed our obligations under the credit facility on a senior secured basis. Obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority perfected security interest, subject to certain permitted encumbrances, in all of our and our subsidiary guarantors' material property and assets. The collateral is required to include properties comprising at least 90% of the PV-10 of our proven reserves. We have also granted our lenders a security interest in our headquarters building and a ranch that we own in West Texas.  Under the credit facility, we are subject to customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and reporting requirements.We are required to maintain a current ratio, as of the last day of each quarter of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1.00.We are also required as of the last day of each quarter to maintain a total debt to EBITDAX ratio of not more than 4.00 to 1.00. The current ratio is defined as the ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities.For the purposes of this calculation, current assets include the portion of the borrowing base which is undrawn but excludes any cash deposited with a counter-party to a hedging arrangement and any assets representing a valuation account arising from the application of ASC 815 and ASC 410-20 and current liabilities exclude the current portion of long-term debt and any liabilities representing a valuation account arising from the application of ASC 815 and ASC 410-20.The interest coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to consolidated interest expense for the four fiscal quarters ended on the calculation date. For the purposes of this calculation, EBITDAX is defined as the sum of consolidated net income plus interest expense, oil and gas exploration expenses, income, franchise or margin taxes, depreciation, amortization, depletion and other non-cash charges including non-cash charges resulting from the application of ASC 718, ASC 815 and ASC 410-20 plus all realized  14 net cash proceeds arising from the settlement or monetization of any hedge contracts plus expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of the credit facility plus expenses incurred in connection with any acquisition permitted under the credit facility plus expenses incurred in connection with any offering of senior unsecured notes, subordinated debt or equity plus up to $1.0 million of extraordinary expenses in any 12-month period plus extraordinary losses minus all non-cash items of income which were included in determining consolidated net loss, including all non-cash items resulting from the application of ASC 815 and ASC 410-20. Interest expense includes total interest, letter of credit fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with any debt. The total debt to EBITDAX ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDAX for the four fiscal quarters ended on the calculation date.For the purposes of this calculation, total debt is the outstanding principal amount of debt, excluding debt associated with the headquarters building and obligations with respect to surety bonds and derivative contracts .  At March31, 2017 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. As of March31, 2017 , the interest coverage ratio was 14.08 to 1.00, the total debt to EBITDAX ratio was 0.42 to 1.00, and our current ratio was 4.34 to 1.00.  The credit facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:   incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;   transfer or sell assets;   create liens on assets;   engage in transactions with affiliates other than on an "arm's length" basis;   make any change in the principal nature of our business; and   permit a change of control.  The credit facility also contains certain additional covenants including requirements that:    100% of the net proceeds from any terminations of derivative contracts must be used to repay amounts outstanding under the credit facility; and    if the sum of our cash on hand plus liquid investments exceeds $10.0 million , then the amount in excess of $10.0 million must be used to pay amounts outstanding under the credit facility.  The credit facility also contains customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal or interest, violations of covenants, cross default and cross acceleration to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and material judgments and liabilities. As of March 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the terms of our credit facility.  Real Estate Lien Note  We have a real estate lien note secured by a first lien deed of trust on the property and improvements which serves as our corporate headquarters. The note bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.25% and is payable in monthly installments of $34,354 . Beginning August 20, 2018, the interest rate will adjust to the bank's then current prime rate plus 1.00% with a maximum rate of 7.25% . The maturity date of the note is July20, 2023 . As of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 , $3.8 million and $3.9 million , respectively, were outstanding on the note.  15 4. Earnings per Share  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:  Basic earnings (loss) per share, excluding any dilutive effects of stock options and unvested restricted stock, is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed in a manner similar to basic; however diluted income (loss) per share reflects the assumed conversion of all potentially dilutive securities. For the three months ended March31, 2016 , 1,642 potential shares related to unvested restricted shares and options were excluded from the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share since their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive due to losses incurred in the period. There were no shares excluded for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  5.  Hedging Program and Derivatives  The derivative contracts we utilize are based on index prices that may and often do differ from the actual oil and gas prices realized in our operations.Our derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting; therefore, fluctuations in the market value of the derivative contracts are recognized in earnings during the current period. There are no netting agreements relating to these derivative contracts and there is no policy to offset.  The following table sets forth the summary position of our derivative contracts as of March31, 2017 :   16   Subsequent to March31, 2017 , we entered into the following derivative contracts:    The following table illustrates the impact of derivative contracts on the Company's balance sheet:   6. Financial Instruments  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:    Level 1   inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.   Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.  A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company is further required to assess the creditworthiness of the counter-party to the derivative contract. The results of the assessment of non-performance risk, based on the counter-party's credit risk, could result in an adjustment of the carrying value of the derivative instrument. The following  17 tables sets forth information about the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 , and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value (in thousands):   The Company's derivative contracts consisted of NYMEX-based fixed price swaps, basis differential swaps and collars as of March31, 2017 , and as of December 31, 2016. Under fixed price swaps, we receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counter-party. Under a basis differential swap, if the market price is above the fixed price we pay the counter-party, if the market price is below the fixed price, the counter-party pays us. Under a collar, we pay the counterparty if the market price is above the ceiling price (short call) and the counterparty pays us if the market price is below the floor price (long put). The NYMEX-based fixed price derivative swaps, basis swaps and collars are indexed to NYMEX futures contracts, which are actively traded, for the underlying commodity and are commonly used in the energy industry. A number of financial institutions and large energy companies act as counter-parties to these type of derivative contracts. As the fair value of NYMEX-based fixed price swaps are based on a number of inputs, including contractual volumes and prices stated in each derivative contract, current and future NYMEX commodity prices, and quantitative models that are based upon readily observable market parameters that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, we have characterized these derivative contracts as Level 2. In order to verify the third party valuation, we enter the various inputs into a model and compare our results to the third party for reasonableness. The fair value of the collar and basis differential swap instruments are based on inputs that are not as observable as the fixed price swaps. In addition to the actively quoted market price, variables such as time value, volatility and other unobservable inputs are used. Accordingly, these instruments have been classified as Level 3.  The following is additional information for the Company's recurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) for the three months ended March31, 2017 .   18  Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements  The Company follows the provisions of ASC 820-10 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. As it relates to the Company, ASC 820-10 applies to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities as may be acquired in a business combination and thereby measured at fair value and the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations for which fair value is used.  The asset retirement obligation estimates are derived from historical costs as well as management's expectation of future cost environments. As there is no corroborating market activity to support the assumptions used, the Company has designated these liabilities as Level 3. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the Company's asset retirement obligation is presented in Note 1.  Other Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term maturities and/or liquid nature of these assets and liabilities. The carrying value of our debt approximates fair value as the interest rates are market rates and this debt is considered Level 2.  7. Commitments and Contingencies  From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. At March31, 2017 , the Company was not involved in any legal proceedings that are expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.  8. Subsequent Events  Subsequent to March 31, 2017, we entered into the following derivative contracts.   19  
Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 The following is a discussion of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on March 16, 2017, and the historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes of the Company included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.  Except as otherwise noted, all tabular amounts are in thousands, except per unit values.  Critical Accounting Policies  There have been no changes from the Critical Accounting Policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  General We are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration, exploitation, development and production of oil and gas in the United States. Historically, we have grown through the acquisition and subsequent development and exploitation of producing properties, principally through the redevelopment of old fields utilizing new technologies such as modern log analysis and reservoir modeling techniques as well as 3-D seismic surveys and horizontal drilling. As a result of these activities, we believe that we have a number of development opportunities on our properties. In addition, we intend to expand upon our development activities with complementary acreage acquisitions in our core areas of operation. Success in our development and exploration activities is critical in the maintenance and growth of our current production levels and associated reserves.  Factors Affecting Our Financial Results  Our financial results depend upon many factors which significantly affect our results of operations including the following:     commodity prices and the effectiveness of our hedging arrangements;    the level of total sales volumes of oil and gas;    the availability of and our ability to raise additional capital resources and provide liquidity to meet cash flow needs;    the level of and interest rates on borrowings; and    the level and success of exploration and development activity.  Commodity Prices and Hedging Arrangements . The results of our operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for our oil and gas production. The prices we receive for our production are dependent upon spot market prices, differentials and the effectiveness of our derivative contracts, which we sometimes refer to as hedging arrangements. Substantially all of our sales of oil and gas are made in the spot market, or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices, and not pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. Accordingly, the prices received for our oil and gas production are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control. Significant declines in prices for oil and gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis.  Oil and gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of oil, NGL and gas, the availability of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, we are unable to predict what changes may occur in oil, NGL, and gas prices in the future. The market price  20 of oil and condensate, NGL and gas in 2017 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact our financial position.   During the three months ended March31, 2017 , the NYMEX future price for oil averaged $51.78 per Bbl as compared to $33.63 per Bbl in 2016. During the three months ended March31, 2017 , the NYMEX future spot price for gas averaged $3.56 per MMBtu compared to $1.98  per MMBtu in 2016. Prices closed on March31, 2017 at $50.60 per Bbl of oil and $3.19 per MMBtu of gas, compared to closing on March31, 2016 at $38.34 per Bbl of oil and $1.96 per MMBtu of gas. On May 5, 2017, prices closed at $46.22 per Bbl of oil and $3.27 per MMBtu of gas. If commodity prices remain at these levels or decline further, our revenue and cash flow from operations will also likely decline.In addition, lower commodity prices could also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically.If oil and gas prices decline, our revenues, profitability and cash flow from operations will also likely decrease which could cause us to alter our business plans, including reducing our drilling activities. Such declines have required, and in future periods could also require us to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas assets which would also cause a reduction in net income. Finally, low commodity prices will likely cause a reduction of the borrowing base under our credit facility.  The realized prices that we receive for our production differ from NYMEX futures and spot market prices, principally due to:   basis differentials which are dependent on actual delivery location;   adjustments for BTU content;   quality of the hydrocarbons; and   gathering, processing and transportation costs.  The following table sets forth our average differentials for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016: _____________________________________ (1) Excludes the impact of derivative activities.  At March31, 2017 , our derivative contracts consisted of NYMEX-based fixed price swaps, basis differential swaps and collars. Under fixed price swaps, we receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counter-party. Under a basis differential swap, if the market price is above the fixed price we pay the counter-party, if the market price is below the fixed price, the counter-party pays us. Under a collar contract, we pay the counterparty if the market price is above the ceiling price (short call) and the counterparty pays us if the market price is below the floor price (long put).  Our derivative contracts equate to approximately 70% of the estimated oil production from our net proved developed producing reserves (based on our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2016) through December31, 2017, 77% in 2018 and 64% in 2019. As of March 31, 2017, we also had NYMEX-based costless collar commodity arrangements on approximately 56% of our estimated net proved developed producing gas reserves (as of December 31, 2016) through December 31, 2017 and a 500 Bopd Midland - Cushing oil price differential swap at ($0.65)/Bbl. By removing a portion of price volatility on our future oil and gas production, we believe we will mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential effects of changing commodity prices on our cash flow from operations for those periods.However, when prevailing market prices are higher than our contract prices, we will not realize increased cash flow.We have in the past and will in the future sustain losses on our derivative contracts if market prices are higher than our contract prices. Conversely, when prevailing market prices are lower than our contract prices, we will sustain gains on our commodity derivative contracts. For the three months ended March31, 2017 , we realized a gain of $9.4 million , consisting of a gain of $0.6 million on closed contracts and a gain of $8.8 million related to open contracts. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, we realized a gain of $0.7 million consisting of a gain of $5.3 million on closed contracts and a loss of $4.6 million related to open contracts. We have not designated any of these derivative contracts as hedges as prescribed by applicable accounting rules.  21 The following table sets forth our derivative contracts at March31, 2017 :   At March31, 2017 , the aggregate fair market value of our commodity derivative contracts was a net asset of approximately $0.8 million .  Subsequent to March31, 2017 we entered into the following derivative contracts:  Production Volumes. Our proved reserves will decline as oil and gas is produced, unless we find, acquire or develop additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities.Based on the reserve information set forth in our reserve report as of December31, 2016, our average annual estimated decline rate for our net proved developed producing reserves is 40%; 15%; 12%; 11% and 9% in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, 9% in the following five years, and approximately 9% thereafter. These rates of decline are estimates and actual production declines could be materially higher.While we have had some success in finding, acquiring and developing additional reserves, we have not always been able to fully replace the production volumes lost from natural field declines and property sales. Our ability to acquire or find additional reserves in the future will be dependent, in part, upon the amount of available funds for acquisition, exploration and development projects.  We had capital expenditures during the three months ended March31, 2017 of $11.0 million related to our exploration and development activities. We have a capital expenditure budget for 2017 of approximately $110.0 million. Approximately $52.5 million of the 2017 budget is allocated to developing ourPermian/Delaware Basinassets including approximately $15.0 million dedicated to expanding our acreage position in theDelaware Basin. The 2017 budget also allocates approximately $42.2 million for drilling and completion of wells in our Williston Basin/Bakken/Three Forks play in North Dakota, with the remaining amount allocated to the Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford area in South Texas as well as lease acquisition and general corporate expenses. The 2017 capital expenditure budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and gas, the availability and costs of drilling and service equipment and crews, economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, the availability of sufficient capital resources, the results of our exploitation efforts, and our ability to obtain permits for drilling locations.  The following table presents historical net production volumes for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016: 22  Availability of Capital . As described more fully under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below, our sources of capital are cash flow from operating activities, borrowings under our credit facility, cash on hand, proceeds from the sale of properties, monetizing of derivative instruments, and if an appropriate opportunity presents itself, the sale of debt or equity securities, although we may not be able to complete any financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.In January 2017, we completed a stock offering of 28.8 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $65.2 million. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility. As of March31, 2017 , our borrowing base was $115.0 million with $97.0 million of availability under our credit facility.  Borrowings and Interest . At March31, 2017 , we had a total of $18.0 million outstanding under our credit facility and total indebtedness of $21.8 million (including the current portion). If interest expense increases as a result of higher interest rates or increased borrowings, more cash flow from operations would be used to meet debt service requirements.As a result, we would need to increase our cash flow from operations in order to fund the development of our drilling opportunities which, in turn, will be dependent upon the level of our production volumes and commodity prices.  Exploration and Development Activity. We believe that our high quality asset base, high degree of operational control and inventory of drilling projects position us for future growth. At December 31, 2016, we operated properties accounting for approximately 95% of our PV-10, giving us substantial control over the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures. We have identified numerous additional drilling locations on our existing leaseholds, the successful development of which we believe could significantly increase our production and proved reserves. Over the five years ended December 31, 2016, we drilled or participated in 124 gross (46.2 net) wells of which 97% were commercially productive.  Our future oil and gas production, and therefore our success, is highly dependent upon our ability to find, acquire and develop additional reserves that are profitable to produce. The rate of production from our oil and gas properties and our proved reserves will decline as our reserves are produced unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful development and exploration activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves. We cannot assure you that our exploration and development activities will result in increases in our proved reserves. If our proved reserves decline in the future, our production may also decline and, consequently, our cash flow from operations and the amount that we are able to borrow under our credit facility may also decline. In addition, approximately 66% of our estimated proved reserves on a Boe basis (33% on a PV-10 basis) at December 31, 2016 were undeveloped. By their nature, estimates of undeveloped reserves are less certain. Recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. We may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves or develop our existing undeveloped reserves, in which case our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Operational Update  Delaware Basin  In Ward County, Texas, the Caprito 98-201H and Caprito 98-301HR are drilled, cased and scheduled for a June 2017 completion. The Caprito 98-301HR targeted the Wolfcamp A2 zone and the Caprito 98-201H targeted the Wolfcamp A1 zone. We estimate that we will own a working interest of approximately 88% in the Caprito 98-201H and 98-301H.  We recently spud a two well pad in the Caprito 83-304H and Caprito 83-404H. The Caprito 83-304H is targeting the Wolfcamp A2 zone and the Caprito 83-404H is targeting the Wolfcamp B zone. We estimate that we will own a working interest of approximately 81% in the Caprito 83-304H and Caprito 83-404H.    23 Williston Basin At our North Fork prospect, in McKenzie County, North Dakota, the Stenehjem 6H-9H are drilled, cased and scheduled for completion in the coming weeks.We own a working interest of approximately 75% in the Stenehjem 6H-9H.  We recently spud a three well pad on the Company's Yellowstone unit. The Yellowstone 2H and 4H will target the Middle Bakken and the Yellowstone 3H will target the Three Forks. We own a working interest of approximately 52% in the Yellowstone 2H-4H.  Eagle Ford/Austin Chalk  In Atascosa County, Texas, we recently spud the Shut Eye 1H targeting the Eagle Ford formation. As a reminder, we will be testing the use of diverters and other enhanced completion techniques to improve the economic viability of the Eagle Ford formation at Jourdanton. Testing the Eagle Ford will have the added benefit of holding acreage through the entire lower Eagle Ford and maintaining the Austin Chalk rights. We will have a 100% working interest in the Shut Eye 1H.  2017 Outlook  Market prices for oil, gas and NGL are inherently volatile. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the future prices for the commodities we produce and sell. Current market fundamentals indicate prices for oil, gas and NGL will be higher than experienced during much of 2016, although remaining much lower than prices prior to mid-2014. Lower prices for oil and gas have had and will likely continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity.  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility. Cash flow from operations is sensitive to many variables, the most volatile of which is the price of the oil, gas and NGL we produce and sell. Lower prices and/or lower production will cause our cash flow from operations to decrease. Availability under our credit facility is currently subject to a borrowing base of $115.0 million. The borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual (April 1 and October 1) and other elective borrowing base redeterminations. The amount of the borrowing base is calculated by the lenders based upon their valuation of our proved reserves securing the facility utilizing these reserve reports and their own internal decisions. The lenders under our credit facility can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under our credit facility. As a result of the decline in commodity prices for oil, gas and NGL, our borrowing base was reduced in 2016. If prices were to decline again in 2017, we would likely experience a decrease in the borrowing base.  In 2016, as a result of the sharp decline in commodity prices, we incurred impairments to our proved properties of $67.6 million. If commodity prices decrease in the future, we would likely incur additional impairments.  Results of Operations  Selected Operating Data . The following table sets forth operating data from continuing operations for the periods presented.  24 ___________________ (1) Revenue and average sales prices are before the impact of hedging activities.   Comparison of Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016  Operating Revenue . During the three months ended March31, 2017 , operating revenue increased to $18.8 million from $9.6 million for the same period of 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily due to higher prices for all products as well as higher sales volumes. Higher realized commodity prices contributed $8.7 million to operating revenue, of which $6.7 million was attributable to oil. Higher sales volumes contributed $0.5 million to operating revenue for the three months ended March31, 2017 .  Oil sales volumes increased to 337 MBbl during the three months ended March31, 2017 from 327 MBbl for the same period of 2016. The increase in oil sales volume was primarily due to new wells brought on line since the first quarter of 2016, offset by natural field declines and property sales. New wells brought on line since the first quarter of 2016 contributed 155 MBbl for the three months ended March31, 2017 . Gas sales volumes increased to 939 MMcf for the three months ended March31, 2017 from 778 MMcf for the same period of 2016. The increase in gas production was due to new wells brought on line since March 31, 2016 which contributed 258 MMcf for the three months ended March31, 2017 , which was partially offset by natural field declines as well as pipeline constraints. NGL sales volumes increased to 120 MBbl for the three months ended March31, 2017 from 82 MBbl for the same period of 2016. The increase in NGL sales was primarily due to more gas production in the Rocky Mountain Region which has a higher NGL content. NGL sales were negatively impacted by plant and pipeline issues in North Dakota and West Texas.  Lease Operating Expenses ("LOE") . LOE for the three months ended March31, 2017 decreased to $4.1 million from $4.8 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in LOE was primarily due to lower cost of services and less non-recurring LOE in the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, we have focused on lowering LOE and shutting in marginal wells, as well as sales of non-core properties. LOE per Boe for the three months ended March31, 2017 was $6.71 compared to $8.82 for the same period of 2016. The decrease per Boe was due to lower costs incurred and higher sales volumes for the three months ended March31, 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016.  Production and Ad Valorem Taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes for the three months ended March31, 2017 increased to $1.6 million from $1.2 million for the same period of 2016. The increase was due to higher commodity prices and higher sales volumes for the three months ended March31, 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016. Production taxes for the three months ended March31, 2017 were 9% of total oil, gas and NGL sales compared to 12% for the same period of 2016. General and Administrative ("G&A") Expense. G&A expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, for the three months ended March31, 2017 increased to $2.0 million from $1.9 million for the same period of 2016. The increase in G&A expense was primarily due to the reinstatement of officers' salaries effective February 1, 2017. G&A expense per Boe, excluding stock-based compensation, was $3.20 for the quarter ended March31, 2017 compared to $3.56 for the same period of 2016. The decrease per Boe was primarily due to higher sales volumes partially offset by slightly higher costs. Stock-Based Compensation. Options granted to employees and directors are valued at the date of grant and expense is recognized over the options vesting period. In addition to options, restricted shares of the Company's common stock have been granted and are valued at the date of grant and expense was recognized over their vesting period. For the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, stock-based compensation expense was $0.8 million for each period. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization ("DD&A") Expense. DD&A expense for the three months ended March31, 2017 decreased to $5.4 million from $5.9 million for the same period of 2016. The decrease was primarily 25 the result of a reduction in the full cost pool as a result of the proved property impairment in 2016. DD&A expense per Boe for the three months ended March31, 2017 was $8.75 compared to $10.94 in 2016. Ceiling Limitation Write-Down . We record the carrying value of our oil and gas properties using the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Under this method, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore for and develop oil and gas properties. Under the full cost accounting rules, the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less related deferred taxes, are limited by country, to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost ceiling, defined as the sum of the present value of estimated unescalated future revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the cost of properties not being amortized, if any, plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, if any, less related income taxes. If the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties exceeds the ceiling limit, we are subject to a ceiling limitation write-down to the extent of such excess. A ceiling limitation write-down is a charge to earnings which does not impact cash flow from operating activities. However, such write-downs do impact the amount of our stockholders' equity and reported earnings. As of March31, 2017 , our net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties did not exceed the cost ceiling of our estimated proved reserves. As of March31, 2016 , our net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceeded the cost ceiling of our estimated proved reserves by approximately $35.1 million , resulting in the recognition of a proved property impairment of the same amount.  The risk that we will be required to write-down the carrying value of our oil and gas assets increases when oil and gas prices are depressed or volatile. In addition, write-downs may occur if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves. We cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write-downs in the future. If commodity prices decline or if any of our proved reserves are revised downward, a further write-down of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties may be required. Interest Expense. Interest  expense for the three months ended March31, 2017 decreased to $0.5 million compared to $1.2 million for the same period of 2016. The decrease in interest expense was due to significantly lower levels of debt for the three months ended March31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.  Loss (Gain) on Derivative Contracts . Derivative gains or losses are determined by actual derivative settlements during the period and on the periodic mark to market valuation of derivative contracts in place. We have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts; therefore, fluctuations in the market value of the derivative contracts are recognized in earnings during the current period. Our derivative contracts consisted of NYMEX-based fixed price swaps, basis differential swaps and collars as of March31, 2017 , and NYMEX-based fixed price swaps and three-way collar contracts as of March31, 2016 . The estimated value of our commodity derivative contracts was a net asset of approximately $0.8 million as of March31, 2017 . When our derivative contract prices are higher than prevailing market prices, we incur gains and conversely, when our derivative contract prices are lower than prevailing market prices, we incur losses. For the three months ended March31, 2017 , we recognized a gain on our commodity derivative contracts of $9.4 million , consisting of a gain on closed contracts of $0.6 million and a gain of $8.8 million relating to open contracts. For the three months ended March31, 2016 , we recognized a gain on our commodity derivative contracts of $0.7 million , consisting of a gain of $5.3 million on closed contracts and a loss of $4.6 million related to open contracts. Income Tax Expense. For the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 there was no income tax expense recognized as a result of NOL carryforwards and a net loss in the three months ended March 31, 2016. Liquidity and Capital Resources  General . The oil and gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business. Our capital requirements are driven principally by our obligations to service debt and to fund the following:    the development and exploration of existing properties, including drilling and completion costs of wells;   acquisition of interests in additional oil and gas properties; and   production and transportation facilities.  The amount of capital expenditures we are able to make has a direct impact on our ability to increase cash flow from operations and, thereby, will directly affect our ability to service our debt obligations and to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties.  Our principal sources of capital are cash flow from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, cash on hand, proceeds from the sale of properties, monetizing of derivative contracts and if appropriate opportunities are available, the sale of debt or equity securities, although we may not be able to complete any such transactions on terms acceptable 26 to us, if at all. Based upon current oil, gas and NGL price expectations and our commodity derivatives positions, we anticipate that our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will provide us sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the remainder of 2017 including our planned capital expenditures.  On January 3, 2017 we closed on the sale of non-core oil and gas properties in Wyoming. Net proceeds of approximately $10.6 million were used to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility. In January 2017, we completed an offering of 28.8 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $65.2 million. Proceeds from the offering were used to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility.  Capital Expenditures . Capital expenditures for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 were $11.0 million and $1.6 million , respectively.  The table below sets forth the components of these capital expenditures:  During the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, our expenditures were primarily for development of our existing properties as well as the acquisition of leaseholds. We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2017 of approximately $110.0 million. Approximately $52.5 million of the 2017 budget is allocated to developing ourPermian/Delaware Basinassets including approximately $15.0 million dedicated to expanding our acreage position in theDelaware Basin. The 2017 budget also allocates approximately $42.2 million for drilling and completion of wells in our Williston Basin/Bakken/Three Forks play in North Dakota, with the remaining amount allocated to the Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford area in South Texas as well as lease acquisition and general corporate expenses. The 2017 capital expenditure budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including the availability and costs of drilling and service equipment and crews, economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and gas, the availability of sufficient capital resources, our financial results and our ability to obtain permits for drilling locations. Additionally, the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on economic and industry conditions and commodity prices. Should the prices of oil and gas decline and if our costs of operations increase or if our production volumes decrease, our cash flows will decrease which may result in a reduction of the capital expenditure budget. If we decrease our capital expenditure budget, we may not be able to offset oil and gas production decreases caused by natural field declines.  Sources of Capital. The net funds provided by and/or used in each of the operating, investing and financing activities are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below:  Operating activities for the three months ended March31, 2017 provided $11.8 million in cash compared to using $2.5 million in the same period of 2016. Non-cash expense items and net changes in operating assets and liabilities accounted for most of these funds. Investing activities used $0.3 million during the three months ended March31, 2017 , as expenditures of $11.0 million for the development of our existing properties were offset by proceeds from the sale of properties classified as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2016 of $10.6 million . Investing activities provided $0.01 million during the three months ended March31, 2016, 27  as proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties of $1.60 million offset expenditures of $1.59 million. Financing activities used $10.4 million for the three months ended March31, 2017 compared to using $0.6 million for the same period of 2016. Funds used during the three months ended March31, 2017 were primarily payments of borrowings under our credit facility, offset by proceeds from the issuance 28.8 million shares of common stock in January 2017 and borrowings under our credit facility. Funds used during the three months ended March 31, 2016 were primarily payments of our borrowings under our credit facility which were offset by proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility.  Future Capital Resources . Our principal sources of capital going forward are cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, cash on hand, proceeds from the sale of properties, monetizing derivative instruments and if an opportunity presents itself, the sale of debt or equity securities, although we may not be able to complete any financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In January 2017, we completed an offering of 28.8 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $65.2 million. Proceeds from the offering were used to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility.  Cash from operating activities is dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes.Depressed commodity prices have reduced, and further decreases in commodity prices from current levels could reduce our cash flows from operations.This could cause us to alter our business plans, including reducing our exploration and development plans.Unless we otherwise expand and develop reserves, our production volumes may decline as reserves are produced.In the future we may continue to sell producing properties, which could further reduce our production volumes. To offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties, we must conduct successful exploration and development activities, acquire additional producing properties or identify and develop additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves. We believe our numerous drilling opportunities will allow us to increase our production volumes; however, our drilling activities are subject to numerous risks, including availability of capital and the risk that no commercially productive oil and gas reservoirs will be found.If our proved reserves decline in the future, our production could also decline and, consequently, our cash flow from operations and the amount that we are able to borrow under our credit facility could also decline. The risk of not finding commercially productive reservoirs will be compounded by the fact that 66% of our total estimated proved reserves on a Boe basis (33% on a PV-10 basis) at December 31, 2016 were classified as undeveloped.  We have in the past, and may in the future, sell producing properties. We have also sold debt and equity securities in the past, and may sell additional debt and equity securities in the future when the opportunity presents itself.  Contractual Obligations. We are committed to making cash payments in the future on the following types of agreements:    Long-term debt, and   Operating leases for office facilities.  Below is a schedule of the future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of March31, 2017 :  ___________________________ (1) These amounts represent the balances outstanding under our credit facility and the real estate lien note. These payments assume that we will not borrow additional funds. (2) Interest expense assumes the balances of long-term debt at the end of the period and current effective interest rates. 28 (3) Lease on office space in Dickinson, North Dakota, which expires on October 31, 2018, office space in Lusk, Wyoming, which will expire on December 31, 2017 and office space in Denver, Colorado which will expire on December 31, 2017.  We maintain a reserve for costs associated with future site restoration related to the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. At March31, 2017 , our reserve for these obligations totaled $8.7 million for which no contractual commitments exist. For additional information relating to this obligation, see Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At March31, 2017 we had no existing off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC regulations, that have, or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  Contingencies. From time to time, we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. At March31, 2017 , we were not engaged in any legal proceedings that are expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on us.  Long-Term Indebtedness.  Long-term debt consisted of the following:   Credit Facility  The Company has a senior secured credit facility with Soci t  G n rale, as administrative agent and issuing lender, and certain other lenders, which we refer to as the credit facility.As of March31, 2017 , $18.0 million was outstanding under the Credit Facility.  The credit facility has a maximum commitment of $300.0 million and availability is subject to a borrowing base. At March31, 2017 , we had a borrowing base of $115.0 million . The borrowing base is determined semi-annually by the lenders based upon our reserve reports, one of which must be prepared by our independent petroleum engineers and one of which may be prepared internally. The amount of the borrowing base is calculated by the lenders based upon their valuation of our proved reserves securing the facility utilizing these reserve reports and their own internal decisions. In addition, the lenders, in their sole discretion, are able to make one additional borrowing base redetermination during any six-month period between scheduled redeterminations and we are able to request one redetermination during any six-month period between scheduled redeterminations. Outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid immediately or we must pledge additional oil and gas properties or other assets as collateral. We do not currently have any substantial unpledged assets and we may not have the financial resources to make any mandatory principal payments. In addition, a reduction of the borrowing base could also cause us to fail to be in compliance with the financial covenants described below. The borrowing base will be automatically reduced in connection with any sales of producing properties with a market value of 5% or more of our then-current borrowing base and in connection with any hedge termination which could reduce the collateral value by 5% or more. Our borrowing base can never exceed the $300.0 million maximum commitment amount.Outstanding amounts under the credit facility bear interest at (a) at any time an event of default exists, at 3% per annum plus the amounts set forth below, and (b) at all other times, at the greater of (x) the reference rate announced from time to time by Soci t  G n rale, (y) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% , and (z a rate determined by Soci t  G n rale as the daily one-month LIBOR plus, in each case, (i) 0.75% - 1.75% , depending on the utilization of the borrowing base, or, (ii) if we elect, LIBOR plus, in each case, 1.75% - 2.75% depending on the 29 utilization of the borrowing base. At March31, 2017 , the interest rate on the credit facility was approximately 2.73% assuming LIBOR borrowings.  Subject to earlier termination rights and events of default, the stated maturity date of the credit facility is June30, 2018 . Interest is payable quarterly on reference rate advances and not less than quarterly on LIBOR advances. We are permitted to terminate the credit facility and are able, from time to time, to permanently reduce the lenders' aggregate commitment under the credit facility in compliance with certain notice and dollar increment requirements.  Each of our subsidiaries has guaranteed our obligations under the credit facility on a senior secured basis. Obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority perfected security interest, subject to certain permitted encumbrances, in all of our and our subsidiary guarantors' material property and assets. The collateral is required to include properties comprising of least 90% of the PV-10 of our proven reserves. We have also granted our lenders a security interest in our headquarters building and a ranch that we own in West Texas.  Under the credit facility, we are subject to customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and reporting requirements.We are required to maintain a current ratio, as of the last day of each quarter of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1.00.We are also required as of the last day of each quarter to maintain a total debt to EBITDAX ratio of not more than 4.00 to 1.00. The current ratio is defined as the ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities.For the purposes of this calculation, current assets include the portion of the borrowing base which is undrawn but excludes any cash deposited with a counter-party to a hedging arrangement and any assets representing a valuation account arising from the application of ASC 815 and ASC 410-20 and current liabilities exclude the current portion of long-term debt and any liabilities representing a valuation account arising from the application of ASC 815 and ASC 410-20.The interest coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to consolidated interest expense for the four fiscal quarters ended on the calculation date. For the purposes of this calculation, EBITDAX is defined as the sum of consolidated net income plus interest expense, oil and gas exploration expenses, income, franchise or margin taxes, depreciation, amortization, depletion and other non-cash charges including non-cash charges resulting from the application of ASC 718, ASC 815 and ASC 410-20 plus all realized net cash proceeds arising from the settlement or monetization of any hedge contracts plus expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of the credit facility plus expenses incurred in connection with any acquisition permitted under the credit facility plus expenses incurred in connection with any offering of senior unsecured notes, subordinated debt or equity plus up to $1.0 million of extraordinary expenses in any 12-month period plus extraordinary losses minus all non-cash items of income which were included in determining consolidated net loss, including all non-cash items resulting from the application of ASC 815 and ASC 410-20. Interest expense includes total interest, letter of credit fees and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with any debt. The total debt to EBITDAX ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDAX for the four fiscal quarters ended on the calculation date.For the purposes of this calculation, total debt is the outstanding principal amount of debt, excluding debt associated with our headquarters building and obligations with respect to surety bonds and derivative contracts .  At March31, 2017 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. As of March31, 2017 , the interest coverage ratio was 14.08 to 1.00, the total debt to EBITDAX ratio was 0.42 to 1.00, and our current ratio was 4.34 to 1.00.  The credit facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:   incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;   transfer or sell assets;   create liens on assets;   engage in transactions with affiliates other than on an "arm's length" basis;   make any change in the principal nature of our business; and   permit a change of control.  The credit facility also contains certain additional covenants including requirements that:    100% of the net proceeds from any terminations of derivative contracts must be used to repay amounts outstanding under the credit facility; and  30   if the sum of our cash on hand plus liquid investments exceeds $10.0 million , then the amount in excess of $10.0 million must be used to pay amounts outstanding under the credit facility.  The credit facility also contains customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal or interest, violations of covenants, cross default and cross acceleration to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and material judgments and liabilities. As of March 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the terms of our credit facility.   Real Estate Lien Note  We have a real estate lien note secured by a first lien deed of trust on the property and improvements which serves as our corporate headquarters. The note bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.25% and is payable in monthly installments of $34,354 . Beginning August 20, 2018, the interest rate will adjust to the bank's then current prime rate plus 1.00% with a maximum rate of 7.25% . The maturity date of the note is July 20, 2023. As of March31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $3.8 million and $3.9 million , respectively, were outstanding on the note.  Hedging Activities  Our results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and we seek to reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps, options and other commodity derivative instruments. We have entered into commodity swaps on approximately 70% of our estimated oil production from our net proved developed producing reserves (based on reserve estimates as of December 31, 2016) through December 31, 2017, 77% for 2018 and 64% for 2019. We have also entered into a NYMEX-based collar on approximately 56% of the gas production of our estimated net proved developed producing reserves (as of December 31, 2016) through December31, 2017 and a 500 Bopd Midland-Cushing oil price differential swap at ($0.65)/Bbl.  By removing a portion of price volatility on our future oil and gas production, we believe that we will mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential effects of changing commodity prices on our cash flow from operations.However, when prevailing market prices are higher than our contract prices, we will not realize increased cash flow on the portion of the production that has been hedged.We have sustained, and in the future will sustain, losses on our derivative contracts when market prices are higher than our contract prices. Conversely, when prevailing market prices are lower than our contract prices, we will sustain gains on our commodity derivative contracts.  If the disparity between our contract prices and market prices continues, we will sustain gains or losses on our derivative contracts. While gains and losses resulting from the periodic mark to market of our open contracts do not impact our cash flow from operations, gains and losses from settlements of our closed contracts do impact our cash flow from operations.  In addition, as our derivative contracts expire over time, we expect to enter into new derivative contracts at then-current market prices.If the prices at which we hedge future production are significantly lower than our existing derivative contracts, our future cash flow from operations would likely be materially lower. 31
