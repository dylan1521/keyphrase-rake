Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  Organization and Nature of Operations.  Adesto Technologies Corporation (together with its subsidiaries; "Adesto", "we", "our", "us" or the "Company") was incorporated in the state of California in January 2006 and reincorporated in Delaware in October 2015. We are a leading provider of application-specific and ultra-low power non-volatile memory ("NVM") products. Our corporate headquarters are located in Sunnyvale, California.  On September 28, 2012, we purchased certain flash memory product assets from Atmel Corporation and our financial results include the operating results of those assets from the date of acquisition.  The Company completed its initial public offering ("IPO") of common stock on October 30, 2015. The Company sold 5,192,184 shares, including 192,184 shares for the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. The shares were sold at an initial public offering price of $5.00 per share for net proceeds of $22.1 million to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.  Basis of Presentation.  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP to complete annual financial statements. In the opinion of our management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company and its results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented have been included. Operating results for the three months ended March31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December31, 2016, for any other interim period or for any other future year.  The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2015 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date, but does not include all of the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  The consolidated financial statements include the results of our operations, and the operations of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies described in  Note 1, Organization and Summary ofSignificant Accounting Policies , in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K  for the year endedDecember31, 2015 that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, except as described below.     Reverse Stock Split.  On October 1, 2015, we effected a 1-for-33 reverse stock split of our common stock and convertible preferred stock (collectively, "Capital Stock"). On the effective date of the reverse stock split, (i) each 33 shares of outstanding Capital Stock were reduced to one share of Capital Stock; (ii) the number of shares of Capital Stock into which each outstanding warrant or option to purchase Capital Stock is exercisable were proportionately reduced on a 33-to-1 basis; (iii) the exercise price of each outstanding warrant or option to purchase Capital Stock were proportionately increased on a 1-to-33 basis; and (iv) each 33 shares of authorized Capital Stock were reduced to one share of Capital Stock. All of the share numbers, share prices, and exercise prices have been adjusted, on a retroactive basis, to reflect this 1-for-33 reverse stock split. The par value of the common stock and convertible preferred stock were not adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split.  Use of Estimates.  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of  7   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate those estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts, reserves for sales, warranty accrual, inventory write-downs, valuation of lo ng-lived assets, including property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, loss on purchase commitments, valuation of deferred taxes and contingencies. In addition, we use assumptions when employing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options granted. We base our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, when these carrying values are not readily available from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Allowances.  We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the selling price is fixed or determinable, transfer of title occurs, and the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Due to the historical immaterial level of product returns under warranty, we do not record a reserve for estimated returns under warranty at the time of revenue recognition.  Generally, we meet product sale revenue recognition conditions upon shipment because, in most cases, title and risk of loss passes to the customer at that time. In addition, we estimate and record provisions for future returns and other charges against revenue at the time of shipment, consistent with the terms of sale. We sell products to distributors at the price listed in our distributor price book. At the time of sale, we record a sales reserve for ship from stock and debits ("SSDs"), stock rotation rights and any special programs approved by management. We offset the sales reserve against recorded revenues, producing the revenue amount reported in our consolidated statements of operations.  The market price for our products can differ significantly from the book price at which we sold the product to the distributor. When the market price of a particular distributor's sales opportunity to their customers would result in low or negative margins for the distributor, as compared to our original book price, we negotiate SSDs with the distributor. Management analyzes our SSD history to develop current SSD rates that form the basis of the SSD revenue reserve recorded each period. We obtain the historical SSD rates from the distributor's records and our internal records.  We typically grant payment terms of between 30 and 60 days to our customers. Our customers generally pay within those terms. Distributors are invoiced for shipments at listed book price. When the distributors pay the invoice, they may claim debits for SSDs previously authorized by us when appropriate. Once claimed, we process the requests against prior authorizations and adjust reserves previously established for that customer.  The revenue we record for sales to our distributors is net of estimated provisions for these programs. Determining net revenue requires significant judgments and estimates on our part. We base our estimates on historical experience rates, the levels of inventory held by our distributors, current trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there is a risk actual amounts may differ materially from our estimates. Our consolidated financial condition and operating results depend on our ability to make reliable estimates. We believe that such estimates are reasonable.  We also monitor collectibility of accounts receivable primarily through review of our accounts receivable aging. When facts and circumstances indicate the collection of specific amounts or from specific customers is at risk, we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and, if necessary, record a charge in the period such determination is made. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts.  Shipping Costs.  We charge shipping costs to cost of revenue as incurred.  Product Warranty.  Our products are sold with a limited warranty for a period of one year, warranting that the product conforms to specifications and is free from material defects in design, materials and workmanship. To date, we have had insignificant returns of any defective production parts. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $250,000 for a specific potential warranty claim. As of March 31, 2016, approximately $41,000 has been incurred relating to this potential warranty claim.  8   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Income Taxes.  We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements, but have not been reflected in our taxable income. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets as necessary when in management's estimate, based on available objective evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We recognize in our consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position that based on its technical merits is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination.  Foreign Currency Translation.  The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. In consolidation, we translate assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date. We translate revenue and expense accounts at the average exchange rates during the period in which the transaction takes place. Net gains or losses from foreign currency translation of assets and liabilities were a loss of $13,000 and a loss of $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, a component of stockholders' equity. Net gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency were a $22,000 gain and a $0.1 million loss for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in other income (expense), net.  Cash and Cash Equivalents.  We consider all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We maintain such funds in overnight cash deposits.  Property and Equipment.  Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the term of the related lease, whichever is shorter. Estimates of useful lives are as follows:          Inventories.  We record inventories at the lower of standard cost (which generally approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or market value. On a quarterly basis, we analyze inventories on a part-by-part basis. The carrying value of inventory is adjusted for excess and obsolete inventory based on inventory age, shipment history and the forecast of demand over a specific future period. At the point of loss recognition, a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that new cost basis. The semiconductor markets that we serve are volatile and actual results may vary from forecast or other assumptions, potentially affecting our assessment of excess and obsolete inventory which could have a material effect on our results of operations.  Long-Lived Assets.  We evaluate our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset. If impairment is indicated, we write the asset down to its estimated fair value. For all periods presented, we have not recognized any impairment losses on our long-lived assets.  9   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Purchased Intangible Assets.  Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Purchased intangible assets with definite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:          Goodwill.  Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed.  We evaluate our goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of November 1 of each year. We last conducted our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2015 and no goodwill impairment was indicated.  When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may initially perform a qualitative assessment which includes a review and analysis of certain quantitative factors to estimate if a reporting unit's fair value significantly exceeds its carrying value. When the estimate of a reporting unit's fair value appears more likely than not to be less than its carrying value based on this qualitative assessment, we continue to the first step of two steps impairment test. The first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, and future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base these fair value estimates on reasonable assumptions that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process is only performed if a potential impairment exists, and it involves determining the difference between the fair values of the reporting unit's net assets, other than goodwill, and the fair value of the reporting unit, and, if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded. In the event that we determine that the value of goodwill has become impaired, we record a charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made. We operate in one reporting unit.   Research and Development Expenses.  Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred.  Stock-based Compensation.  We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. We determine fair value for stock options awarded to employees at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make various assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, expected future share price volatility and expected term. We determine the fair value of stock options awarded to non-employees at each vesting date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and re-measure fair value at each reporting period until the services required under the arrangement are completed. Fair value is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock-based awards expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock-based awards that are granted, exercised and cancelled. If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense in future periods could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current period.     10   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Concentration of Risk.  Our products are primarily manufactured, assembled and tested by third-party foundries and other contractors in Asia and we are heavily dependent on a single foundry in Taiwan for the manufacture of wafers and a single contractor in the Philippines for assembly and testing of our products. We do not have long-term agreements with either of these suppliers. A significant disruption in the operations of these parties would adversely impact the production of our products for a substantial period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables. We place substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents on deposit with a reputable, high credit quality financial institution in the United States of America. We believe that the bank that holds substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents is financially sound and, accordingly, subject to minimal credit risk. Deposits held with the bank may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits.  We generally do not require collateral or other security in support of accounts receivable. We periodically review the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay. As a result of our favorable collection experience and customer concentration, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Customer concentrations as a percentage of total revenue were as follows:              *   less than 10%  Customer concentrations as a percentage of gross accounts receivable were as follows:              *   less than 10%  Net Loss per Share.  Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for potentially dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock and if-converted methods. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, common stock options, restricted stock units, and warrants are considered to be potentially dilutive securities.  Loss Contingencies.  We are or have been subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We evaluate contingent liabilities, including threatened or pending litigation, for potential losses. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceedings is considered probable and the amount can be estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based upon the best information available. For potential losses for which there is a reasonable possibility (meaning the likelihood is more than remote but less than probable) that a loss exists, we will disclose an estimate of the potential loss or range of such potential loss or include a statement that an estimate of the potential loss cannot be made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates, which could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  11   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Recent Accounting Pronouncements.  In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments require management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and provide guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs", which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance on our consolidated financial statements with no effect in the first three months of 2016.  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, amending Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC 740"). Upon adoption, this topic supersedes the existing guidance under ASC 740 and aims to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Currently, U.S. GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. This amendment requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods), or the first quarter 2017 for Adesto. We early adopted this ASU at the beginning of our fourth quarter of 2015 and applied it prospectively. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, amending ASC 330. Upon adoption, this topic supersedes the existing guidance under ASC 330 and aims to simplify the subsequent measurement of inventory. Currently, inventory can be measured at the lower of cost or market, which could result in several potential outcomes, as market could be replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. The major amendments would be as follows: 1. Inventory should be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. 2. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. 3. The amendment does not apply to inventory measured under LIFO or the retail inventory method. 4. The amendment does apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory measured via FIFO or average cost. We plan to adopt this guidance effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years), or the first quarter of 2017, and do not expect it to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, creating ASC Topic 606. Upon adoption, this topic supersedes the existing guidance under ASC 605 and aims to simplify the number of requirements to follow for revenue recognition and make revenue recognition more comparable across various entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. There are 5 core principles: 1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer. 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 3. Determine the transaction price. 4. Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract. 5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Additional considerations under this update include: accounting for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. We plan to adopt this guidance effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods), or the first quarter of 2018, and are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This ASU requires lease assets and lease liabilities arising from leases, including operating leases, to be recognized on the balance sheet, ASU 2016-02 will become effective for us on January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.           12   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Note 2.

Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):             Note 3. Fair Value Measurements.  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument's classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:  Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 . Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices which are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.  Level 3. Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and which are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:          As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.        Note 4. Purchased Intangible Assets.  In 2012, in connection with our purchase of the serial flash memory product line assets from Atmel Corporation, we recorded $16.4 million of intangible assets.  14   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Intangible assets were as follows (in thousands):               We recorded amortization expense related to the acquisition-related intangible assets as follows (in thousands):          The estimated future amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets subject to amortization after March 31, 2016 is as follows (in thousands):             Note 5. Borrowings.  Bridge Bank Loan.  In October 2013, we entered into the Business Financing Agreement (the "BFA") with Bridge Bank N.A. The BFA consisted of both a revolving credit facility under which we were permitted to borrow up to 80% of eligible accounts receivable but not to exceed $7.5 million and a term loan in the amount of $9.0 million. Interest on the revolving credit facility accrued at the bank's prime rate, which under the BFA could not have been less than 3.25%, plus 1.25% while interest on the term loan accrues at the bank's prime rate plus 3%. Under the term loan, we were required to make interest only payments through April 2014 and principal payments of $300,000 monthly thereafter plus interest. Borrowings under the BFA were secured by all of our assets and were subject to certain financial covenants, including maintaining minimum levels of EBITDA on a quarterly basis and a certain minimum asset coverage ratio based on the ratio of unrestricted cash plus certain accounts receivable to total outstanding under the agreement.  15   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     I n October 2014, we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants. As a result, in October 2014, we entered into the First Business Financing Modification Agreement (the "BFA Modification") under which the covenant defaults were waived. The BFA Mo dification (i) increased the interest rate charged on the term loan from the bank's prime rate plus 3% to the bank's prime rate plus 4% and would have declined to the bank's prime rate plus 3% upon the raising of additional equity of not less than $2.5 mil lion, (ii) required us to continue to maintain certain minimum levels of EBITDA and asset coverage ratios, (iii) required us to maintain unrestricted cash of not less than $4.25 million until that point at which we either receive additional equity of not l ess than $5.0 million or maintain a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 (based on the ratio of EBITDA to current portion of total amounts outstanding under the BFA Modification plus period-to-date interest expense payments) for two co nsecutive quarters.  In addition, under the BFA the bank was paid a facility fee of $82,500 at closing. Under the BFA Modification, the bank was paid an additional facility fee of $50,000 and received a warrant to purchase 1,488 shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock. The facility fees and the value of the warrant, $0.1 million, were recorded as a debt discount and have been amortized over the life of the agreement. Amortization of debt discount was $0.1 million in 2015.    Borrowings of $10.9 million under this facility were repaid in full in April 2015.  Opus Bank Term Loan.  In April 2015, we entered into a three-year $15.0 million credit agreement, or the new term loan facility, which replaced our prior senior secured revolving credit and term loan facility. The agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $15.0 million to be used for general corporate purposes including working capital, to repay certain indebtedness and for capital expenditures and other expenses. Interest will accrue on any outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to (a) the higher of (i) the prime rate (as publicly announced from time to time by the Wall Street Journal) and (ii) 3.25% plus (b) (i) 1.00% if our cash equivalents are greater than 125% of the outstanding principal of our borrowings under the new term loan facility, or (ii) 2.00% if our cash and cash equivalents are less than or equal to 125% of such borrowings. Indebtedness we incur under this agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a monthly asset coverage ratio after September 30, 2015 of not less than 1.10 to 1.00, and quarterly adjusted EBITDA (measured on a trailing three-month basis) of $1 through March 31, 2016 and increasing to higher levels thereafter. Under the agreement, the quarterly EBITDA covenant is not applicable if the asset coverage ratio is met at all times during any particular quarter. The agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, repurchase stock, pay dividends, transfer assets, merge or consolidate and make acquisitions. Upon an occurrence of an event of default, we could be required to pay interest on all outstanding obligations under the agreement at a rate of five percent above the otherwise applicable interest rate, and the lender may accelerate our obligations under the agreement. As of March 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions and had borrowings of $12.5 million outstanding. We may not draw additional funds under the new term loan facility and our borrowings mature on April 30, 2018.  In connection with the new term loan facility, Opus Bank received a warrant to purchase 31,897 shares of Series E convertible preferred stock. Upon the completion of our IPO on October 30, 2015 the preferred stock warrants were converted into 315,282 of our common stock warrants. In addition, we paid financing costs of $0.1 million. The financing costs and the value of the warrant, $0.9 million, were recorded as a debt discount and are being amortized over the life of the agreement. Amortization of debt discount was $0.1 million for the three months ended in March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2016, the remaining unamortized debt discount was $0.5 million.  Outstanding borrowings consisted of the following (in thousands):          16   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Future repayments on outstanding borrowings (excluding unamortized discount of $0.5 million as of March31, 2016) are as follows (in thousands):          Interest expense incurred under our borrowings was $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively.         Note 6. Segment Information.  We operate in one business segment, application-specific and feature-rich, ultra-low power NVM products.

On November 2, 2015, the Company extended the lease for its headquarters by six months to July 2016 by entering into that certain Amendment to Commercial Sublease, dated November 2, 2015, between the Company and eGain Corporation. The Amendment provides for a base rent during the extension period of $47,087 per month.  Additionally, on November 2, 2015, the Company entered into a lease with Peterson Ridge LLC pursuant to which the Company has leased a new headquarters facility, consisting of an aggregate of approximately 34,000 square feet of space in Santa Clara, California. The initial term of the lease commenced on November 2, 2015 and is scheduled to end on July 31, 2023 and may be extended, at the Company's option, for an additional five-year period following the initial lease term.  17   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Pursuant to the lease, monthly base rental paymen ts due under the lease are expected to be approximately $93,000 per month between August1, 2016 and February27, 2017, with annual increases of approximately 3% thereafter. The Company must also pay for certain other operating costs under the lease, inclu ding operating expenses, taxes, assessments, insurance, utilities, securities and property management fees. Peterson Ridge LLC is obligated to reimburse the Company for up to $2,521,051 of the Company's out-of-pocket costs associated with any tenant improv ements, as defined in the lease.  Rent expense under operating leases for three months ended March 31, 2016 was $0.5 million.           Capital Leases.  We have entered into various lease agreements for equipment and software under capital leases with terms of between 24 to 48 months. The equipment and software under the leases are collateral for the lease obligations and are included within property and equipment, net, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Future minimum commitments for capital leases as of March 31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):          Obligations under capital leases are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  Equipment acquired under capital leases is included in property and equipment, net and consisted of the following (in thousands):          Purchase Commitments.  As of March 31, 2016 we had purchase commitments due within one year with our third-party foundries of $3.6 million and $3.0 million in conjunction with an agreement with TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Company.  Litigation.  Although we are not currently subject to any litigation, and no litigation is currently threatened against us, we may be subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation, including intellectual property litigation, arising in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes and are not predictable with assurance. We accrue amounts that we believe are adequate to address any liabilities related to legal proceedings and other loss contingencies that we believe will result in a probable loss that is reasonably estimable  18   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Indemnification.  During the normal course of business, we may make certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees which may include intellectual property indemnities to certain of our customers in connection with the sales of our products and indemnities for liabilities associated with the infringement of other parties' technology based upon our products. Our exposure under these indemnification provisions is generally limited to the total amount paid by a customer under the agreement. However, certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of the amount received under the agreement. In addition, we indemnify our officers, directors and certain key employees while they are serving in good faith in such capacities.  We have not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Where necessary, we accrue for losses for any known contingent liabilities, including those that may arise from indemnification provisions, when future payment is probable.        Note 8. Common Stock, Common Stock Warrants and Stock Option Plan.  Common Stock.  We were authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with $0.0001 par value per share as of December 31, 2015 and 6,666,666 shares of common stock with no par value per share as of December 31, 2014. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote per share. The holders of common stock are also entitled to receive dividends, when and if declared by our Board of Directors.  Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance.  As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had reserved shares of common stock for future issuances as follows:          Upon completion of our IPO on October 30, 2015 all outstanding shares of our preferred stock were converted into 9,114,739 shares of common stock.  Common Stock Warrants.  The following common stock warrants were outstanding as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and were the result of a conversion of preferred stock warrants upon the completion of our IPO on October 30, 2015.             Common stock warrants are exercisable at the option of the holder any time after the date of issuance into shares of our common stock. The aggregate amount of shares of common stock that would be issued is determined by dividing the exercisable price by the conversion price applicable on the date of conversion multiplied by the number of warrants exercised.  19   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Employee Benefit Plans  2007 Equity Incentive Plan.  In 2007, our Board of Directors and shareholders approved the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan") under which 272,727 shares of common stock were reserved and available for the issuance of stock options and restricted stock to eligible participants. The 2007 Plan was subsequently amended to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2007 Plan to 787,878 and during the year ended December 31, 2015, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2007 Plan was increased to 2,651,515. Options and restricted stock awards were granted at a price per share not less than the 85% of the fair value at the date of grant or award, respectively. Restricted stock awarded to persons controlling more than 10% of our stock were granted at a price per share not less than the 100% of the fair value at the date of the award. Options that were granted to new employees generally vest over a four-year period with 25% vesting at the end of one year and the remaining to vest monthly thereafter, while options that were granted to existing employees generally vest over a four-year period. Options granted generally are exercisable up to 10 years from the date of grant. As of October 26, 2015, no shares were available for grant under the 2007 Plan and all outstanding options continue to be governed and remain outstanding in accordance with their existing terms under the 2007 Plan. In addition, any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2007 Plan that are issuable upon the exercise of options that expire or become unexercisable for any reason without having been exercised in full will be available for future grant and issuance under the 2015 Plan (as defined below).  2015 Equity Incentive Plan  In September 2015, our Board of Directors adopted, and in October 2015 our stockholders approved, our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan became effective on the date immediately prior to the date of our initial public offering. As a result, 1,813,272 shares of common stock previously reserved but unissued under the 2007 Plan on the effective date of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan became reserved for issuance under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, and we ceased granting awards under our 2007 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will increase automatically on the first day of January of each of 2016 through 2025 by the number of shares equal to 4% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31. However, our Board of Directors may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year.  Our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan authorizes the award of stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units ("RSU's"), performance awards and stock bonuses. No person will be eligible to receive more than 2,000,000 shares in any calendar year under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan other than a new employee of ours, who will be eligible to receive no more than 4,000,000 shares under the plan in the calendar year in which the employee commences employment. The aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be subject to awards granted to any single non-employee director pursuant to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan in any calendar year shall not exceed 300,000. Our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan provides that no more than 25,000,000 shares will be issued as incentive stock options.  2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In September 2015, our Board of Directors adopted, and in October 2015 our stockholders approved, our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). The 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan became effective on the date of our initial public offering. We reserved 150,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will increase automatically on the first day of January following the first offering date by the number of shares equal to 1% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31 (rounded to the nearest whole share). However, our Board of Directors may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. The aggregate number of shares issued over the term of our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will not exceed 2,250,000 shares of our common stock.  Under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, eligible employees will be able to acquire shares of our common stock by accumulating funds through payroll deductions. Eligible employees will be able to select a rate of payroll deduction up to 15% of their base cash compensation. The purchase price for shares of our common stock purchased under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock on (i) the first trading day of the applicable offering period and (ii) the last trading day of each purchase period in the applicable offering period. Except for the first offering period, each offering period will run for no more than six months, with purchases occurring every six months. The first offering period began upon the effective date of our IPO and will end on June 30, 2016.  No participant will have the right to purchase shares of our common stock in an amount that has a fair market value greater than $25,000, determined as of the first day of the applicable purchase period, for each calendar year in which that right is outstanding. In  20   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     addition, no participant will be permitted to purchase m ore than 2,500 shares during any one purchase period or a lesser amount as determined by our compensation committee.  Our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will continue until the earlier to occur of its termination by our Board of Directors, the issuance of all shares reserved for issuance under it or the tenth anniversary of its effective date.  A summary of stock option and restricted stock units activity under the 2007 Plan and the 2015 Plan is as follows:                     Note 9. Stock-based Compensation.  We record stock-based compensation based on fair value as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recognize such costs as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the employee's requisite service period, which is generally four years. Our valuation assumptions are as follows:  21   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Fair value of common stock. Prior to our IPO in October 2015, we estimated the fair value of our common stock using various valuation methodologies, including valuation analyses performed by third-party valuation firms. After the initial public offering, we used the publicly quoted price as the fair value of our common stock.  Risk-free interest rate. We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent expected term of the options for each option group.  Expected term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumption is based on the simplified method in which the expected term is equal to the average of the stock-based award's weighted-average vesting period and its contractual term. We expect to continue using the simplified method until sufficient information about historical behavior is available.  Volatility. We determine volatility based on the historical stock volatilities of a group of publicly listed guideline companies over a period equal to the expected terms of the options, as we do not have sufficient trading history to determine the volatility of our common stock.  Dividend yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividend and do not currently plan to pay a cash dividend in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.  The following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine fair value of stock options:  We did not make any new grants of stock options during the first three months of 2016 and 2015.     The following table presents the effects of stock-based compensation for stock options, RSU's and ESPP shares during the periods (in thousands):          Stock-based compensation expense capitalized to inventories was not material during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We did not realize any income tax benefit from stock option exercises in either of the periods presented due to recurring losses and valuation allowances.  As of March 31, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, was approximately $0.5 million, and this amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2 years.  As of March 31, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSU's and ESPP was $4.4 million and $62,000, respectively, and there amounts are expected to be recognized over 1.6 years and 0.3 years, respectively.           Note 10. Income Taxes.  We recorded an income tax provision of $14,000 and $49,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively. The income tax provision is comprised of estimates of current taxes due in domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The income tax provision reflects tax expense associated with state income tax, foreign taxes, uncertain tax positions and tax expense  22   Adesto Technologies Corporation  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     related to the recording of a deferred tax liability that results from the amortization for income tax purposes of acquisition-related goodwill. The decrease in the tax provision between 2016 and 2015  is primarily due to a decrease in French subsidiary taxes.  As of March 31, 2016, our deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance except in those jurisdictions where it is determined that a valuation allowance is not required. Accounting for income taxes (ASC 740), Income Taxes, provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not. Based on the weight of available evidence, which includes historical operating performance, reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results, we provided a full valuation allowance against our net U.S. deferred tax assets. We reassess the need for our valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. If it is later determined that a portion or all of the valuation allowance is not required, it generally will be a benefit to the income tax provision in the period that such determination is made.  We evaluate tax positions for recognition using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, and those tax positions eligible for recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon the effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for our income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. The Company does not anticipate a material change in the total amount or composition of its unrecognized tax benefits within the 12 months of March 31, 2016.  We file tax returns in the United States for federal, California, and other states. All tax years remain open to examination for both federal and state purposes as a result of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards. We file foreign tax returns in the United Kingdom, France, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. These tax years remain open to examination, except for 2011 and prior years in France.        Note 11.

Item2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results  The discussion below contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to safe harbors under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or to our future financial or operating performance. You can generally identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as "may," "might," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "could," "intend," "target," "projects," "contemplates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. We have based these forward-looking statements primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events occurring or circumstances arising after the date of this report. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and our actual results, performance, or achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements on the basis of several factors, including those that we discuss in Risk Factors, set forth in Part II, Item 1A, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We encourage you to read that section carefully.  The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In this Quarterly Report, unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, "Adesto," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Adesto Technologies Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Overview  We are a leading provider of application-specific and ultra-low power non-volatile memory, or NVM, products. We optimize our NVM products for Internet of Things, or IoT, applications including current and next-generation Internet-connected devices in the consumer, industrial, medical and wearables markets. We combine our NVM design capabilities with proprietary intellectual property and differentiated technology platforms to deliver high-performance products that dramatically reduce the overall energy consumption of our customers' systems and extend battery life. Our products feature embedded intelligence in a small form factor and high reliability.  Our revenue is derived from the sale of our NVM products, primarily our standard serial flash memory products, which represented substantially all of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2016. On September 28, 2012, we purchased certain flash memory product assets from Atmel Corporation, or Atmel. The products we acquired as part of the acquisition were approaching the end of their life cycle and experiencing annual revenue declines. While we provide support for these products, we have not invested further in their research and development. Revenue from these legacy products have declined to $0.3 million from $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect that revenue from these products will continue to decline in the future. Since the acquisition, we have invested in developing new products that are better suited for low-power, high-growth applications, accelerated development of select products and introduced new products based on the acquired technology. In 2013, we introduced the first of our next-generation DataFlash and Fusion Flash products, which have similar functionality to our legacy products, but also offer enhanced features such as ultra-deep power down and wide supply voltage range operation. Revenue from our next-generation NVM products were $9.9 million and $8.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We had been exclusively developing products based on Conductive Bridging RAM, or CBRAM, technology prior to the acquisition of assets from Atmel. In 2015 we introduced Mavriq and Moneta, two CBRAM-based families of memory products, and shipped more than 5.0 million units of these products. We continue to develop and enhance our families of CBRAM-based products, although revenue associated with these products has not been material to date. We have made and continue to make these upfront investments because we believe that the introduction of any fundamentally new semiconductor technology must necessarily go through a lengthy customer evaluation process and several cycles of improvement in the field before it can be widely adopted or generate material revenue.  For the three months ended March 31, 2016, our products were sold to approximately 400 end customers. In general, we work directly with our customers to have our NVM devices designed into and qualified for their products. Although we maintain direct sales, support and development relationships with our customers, once our products are designed into a customer's product, we sell a majority of our products to those customers through distributors. We generated 72% and 66% of our revenue from distributors during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to three distributors generated approximately 41% and 28% of  24      our revenue during the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additiona lly, we derived approximately 83% and 78% of our revenue internationally during the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the majority of which was recognized in the Asia Pacific, or APAC, region. Revenue by geography is recognized base d on the region to which our products are sold, and not to where the end products are shipped. Our headquarters are located in Sunnyvale, California, with additional sales operations in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and APAC r egions. We recorded revenue of $10.2 million and $9.7million, and net losses of $1.5million and $2.3 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Factors Affecting Our Performance  Product adoption in new markets and applications. We optimize our products to meet the technical requirements of the emerging IoT market. The growth in the IoT market is dependent on many factors, most of which are outside of our control. Should the IoT market not develop or develop more slowly, our financial results could be adversely affected.  Ability to attract and retain customers that make large orders. In 2015, our products were sold to approximately 500 end customers, of which approximately 20 generated more than half our revenue. One end customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in 2015. While we expect the composition of our customers to change over time, our business and operating results will depend on our ability to continually target new and retain existing customers that make large orders, particularly those in growth markets which are less dependent on macroeconomic conditions.  Design wins with new and existing customers. We believe our solutions significantly improve the performance and potentially lower the system cost of our customers' designs, particularly if we are part of the early design phase. Accordingly, we work closely with our customers and targeted prospects to understand their product roadmaps and strategies. We consider design wins to be critical to our future success. We define a design win as the successful completion of the evaluation stage, where a customer has tested our product, verified that our product meets its requirements, qualified our NVM device for their products and placed an order for the purchase of our products. The number of our design wins has grown from 32 in 2013 to 65 in 2014 and to 135 in 2015, including 6, 63, and 125 design wins for new products, respectively. We had 29 new design wins during the first three months of 2016. The revenue that we generate, if any, from each design win can vary significantly. Our long-term sales expectations are based on forecasts from customers, internal estimates of customer demand factoring in expected time to market for end customer products incorporating our solutions and associated revenue potential and internal estimates of overall demand based on historical trends.  Pricing, product cost and gross margins of our products. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the timing of changes in pricing, shipment volumes, new product introductions, changes in product mixes, changes in our purchase price of fabricated wafers and assembly and test service costs, manufacturing yields and inventory write downs, if any. In general, newly introduced products and products with higher performance and more features tend to be priced higher than older, more mature products. Average selling prices in the semiconductor industry typically decline as products mature. Consistent with this historical trend, we expect that the average selling prices of our products will decline as they mature. In the normal course of business, we will seek to offset the effect of declining average selling prices on existing products by reducing manufacturing costs and introducing new and higher value-added products. If we are unable to maintain overall average selling prices or offset any declines in average selling prices with realized savings on product costs, our gross margin will decline.  Investment in growth. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, in expanding our operations, increasing our headcount, developing our products and differentiated technologies to support our growth and expanding our infrastructure. We expect our total operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future to meet our growth objectives. We plan to continue to invest in our sales and support operations throughout the world, with a particular focus in the near term of adding additional sales and field applications personnel in APAC to further broaden our support and coverage of our existing customer base, in addition to developing new customer relationships and generating design wins. We also intend to continue to invest additional resources in research and development to support the development of our products and differentiated technologies. Any investments we make in our sales and marketing organization or research and development will occur in advance of experiencing any benefits from such investments, and the return on these investments may be lower than we expect. In addition, as we invest in expanding our operations internationally, our business and results will become further subject to the risks and challenges of international operations, including higher operating expenses and the impact of legal and regulatory developments outside the United States.  Components of Our Results of Operations  Revenue  We derive substantially all of our revenue through the sale of our NVM products to OEMs and ODMs, primarily through distributors. We generated 72% and 66% of our revenue from distributors during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015,  25      respectively. We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We sell the majority of our products to distributors and generally recognize revenue when we ship the product directly to the distributors.  Because our distributors market and sell their products worldwide, our revenue by geographic location is not necessarily indicative of where our customers' product sales and design win activity occur, but rather of where their manufacturing operations occur.  Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin  Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs paid to our third-party manufacturers for wafer fabrication, assembly and testing of our NVM products, write-downs of inventory for excess and obsolete inventories including write-downs of inventory for products based on CBRAM technology and accruals for future losses on CBRAM wafer purchase commitments to the extent our costs exceed the market price for such products. To a lesser extent, cost of revenue also includes depreciation of test equipment and expenses relating to manufacturing support activities, including personnel-related costs, logistics and quality assurance and shipping.  Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the timing of changes in pricing, shipment volumes, new product introductions, changes in product mixes, changes in our purchase price of fabricated wafers and assembly and test service costs, manufacturing yields and inventory write downs, if any. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.  Operating Expenses  Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expense. Personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, are the most significant component of each of our operating expense categories. In addition, in the near term we expect to hire additional personnel, primarily in our selling and marketing functions, and increase research and development expenditures, such as prototype wafers, associated with the implementation of our CBRAM technology in a manufacturing facility in Asia. Accordingly, we expect our operating expenses to increase as we invest in these initiatives.  Research and Development .Our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for the design and development of our products and technologies. Additional research and development expenses include product prototypes, mask costs, external test and characterization expenses, depreciation, amortization of design tool software licenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and allocated overhead expenses. We also incur costs related to outsourced research and development activities. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to improve our product features, increase our portfolio of solutions and implement our CBRAM manufacturing technology in a new manufacturing facility.  Sales and Marketing . Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for our sales, business development, marketing, and applications engineering activities, third-party sales representative commissions, promotional and other marketing expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and travel expenses. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our direct sales teams, primarily in the Asia Pacific Region, and increase our marketing activities.  General and Administrative .General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, consulting expenses and professional fees. Professional fees principally consist of legal, audit, tax and accounting services. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we hire additional personnel, make improvements to our infrastructure and incur significant additional costs for the compliance requirements of operating as a public company, including higher legal, insurance and accounting expenses.  Other Income (Expense), Net  Other income (expense), net is comprised of interest income (expense) and other income (expense). Interest expense consists of interest on our outstanding debt. Other expense, net consists primarily of the change in fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability and foreign exchange gains or losses. Our foreign currency exchange gains and losses relate to transactions and asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  26      Prior to our IPO, we cl assified our preferred stock warrants as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets and recorded changes in fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding change recorded as other income (expense). We recorded a final adjustment to the fa ir value of the warrants as of the closing of our IPO on October30, 2015 and the warrants are no longer subject to fair value accounting thereafter due to their conversion into warrants to purchase common stock.  Provision for Income Taxes  Provision for income taxes consists primarily of U.S. federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credits related primarily to research and development. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except percentage data):  Revenue               Revenue increased by $0.5 million, or 5%, during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase in sales of our data flash products. During the first three months of 2016, we began to see a slowdown in customer orders that we believe were due to reduced consumer demand in our end markets.  Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin          Cost of revenue decreased by $0.7 million, or 11%, during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015 due primarily to a reduction in direct manufacturing costs.  Gross margin increased by $1.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to improvements in our cost structure and an increase in sales of data flash products.  27      Operating Expenses          Research and Development .Research and development expense increased by $1.0million during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015, due to personnel related expenses of $0.6 million, an increase in materials and supplies of $0.2 million, and an increase of facilities costs of $0.2 million.  Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense increased by $0.6million during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015, mainly due to personnel related expenses.  General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by $0.9million during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended March31, 2015, mainly due to personnel related expenses of $0.6 million, legal, accounting, and insurance costs of $0.2 million and facilities costs of $0.1 million.  Gain from settlement with a former foundry supplier. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recognized a non-cash gain of $2.0 million resulting from a settlement of a disputed liability with a former foundry supplier. We did not recognize a similar gain or loss during the three months ended March 31, 2015.  Other Income (Expense), Net          Interest expense, net increased by $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015, due to increased levels of debt outstanding.  Other income (expense), net increased by $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015 due primarily to favorable foreign currency transaction adjustments.  Provision for Income Taxes          Provision for income taxes decreased by $35,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to a reduction in tax expense related to our French subsidiary.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Since inception, we have funded our operations primarily with gross proceeds from the sale of an aggregate of $78.5 million of convertible preferred stock, $22.5 million of term debt associated with the acquisition of the certain flash memory product assets from Atmel Corporation, and net proceeds from our IPO on October 30, 2015 of $22.1 million. Our principal source of liquidity as of  28      March 31, 2016 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $19.1million. We did not have any bo rrowing capacity available under our credit facility as of March 31, 2016. Our outstanding borrowings under this credit facility as of March 31, 2016 were $12.5million. Substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are held in the United States.  We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs over the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and our costs to implement new manufacturing technologies. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any additional debt financing obtained by us in the future could also involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Additionally, if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.  The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:          Cash Flows from Operating Activities  Our primary source of cash from operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs, investments in research and development and sales and marketing, and inventory procurement. Net cash used in operating activities for the periods presented consisted of net losses adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in working capital. Within changes in working capital, changes in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable generally account for the largest adjustments, as we typically use more cash to fund accounts receivable and build inventory as our business grows. Increases in accounts payable typically provides more cash as we do more business with our contract foundries and other third parties, depending on the timing of payments.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, cash used in operating activities was $2.1 million, primarily from a net loss of $1.5 million and the impact of a $2.0 million non-cash gain resulting from a settlement with a former foundry supplier partially offset by non-cash charges of $0.8 million related to stock-based compensation expense and $0.6 million related to depreciation and amortization.  During the three months ended March 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $0.3 million, primarily from a net loss of $2.3 million offset by a net change in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.8 million and non-cash charges of $0.8 million primarily related to and stock based compensation, depreciation, and amortization.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  Our investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment. We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures to support continued growth of our business. During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, cash used in investing activities was $0.4 million and $31,000, respectively, due to purchases of equipment.  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  Cash flows from financing activities primarily include proceeds and payments related to our term loans and our credit facilities.  During three months ended March 31, 2016, cash used in financing activities was $1.5 million due to principal payments on outstanding loan obligations.  29      During three months ended March 31, 2015, cash used in financing activities was $1.5million due to principal payments on outstanding borrowings.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  During the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purpose.  Credit Facility  In April 2015, we entered into a three-year $15.0 million credit agreement, or the new term loan facility, which replaced our prior senior secured revolving credit and term loan facility. The agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $15.0 million to be used for general corporate purposes including working capital, to repay certain indebtedness and for capital expenditures and other expenses. Interest will accrue on any outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to (a) the higher of (i) the prime rate (as publicly announced from time to time by the Wall Street Journal) and (ii) 3.25% plus (b) (i) 1.00% if our cash and cash equivalents are greater than 125% of the outstanding principal of our borrowings under the new term loan facility, or (ii) 2.00% if our cash and cash equivalents are less than or equal to 125% of such borrowings. Indebtedness we incur under this agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a monthly asset coverage ratio after September 30, 2015 of not less than 1.10 to 1.00, and quarterly adjusted EBITDA (measured on a trailing three-month basis) of $1 through March 31, 2016 and increasing to higher levels thereafter. . Under the agreement, the quarterly EBITDA covenant is not applicable if the asset coverage ratio is met at all times during any particular quarter. The agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, repurchase stock, pay dividends, transfer assets, merge or consolidate and make acquisitions. Upon an occurrence of an event of default, we could be required to pay interest on all outstanding obligations under the agreement at a rate of five percent above the otherwise applicable interest rate, and the lender may accelerate our obligations under the agreement. As of March 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions and had gross borrowings of $12.5 million outstanding. We may not draw additional funds under the new term loan facility and our borrowings mature on April 30, 2018.  Contractual Obligations and Commitments  The following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of March 31, 2016:              (1)   Operating leases primarily relate to our leases of office space with terms expiring through July 31, 2023.      (2)   Represents outstanding purchase orders for wafer commitments that we have placed with our suppliers as of March 31, 2016.      (3)   Financing arrangements represent debt maturities under our term loan.      (4)   Capital lease obligations relate to the lease of certain equipment with terms that expire in 2016.
