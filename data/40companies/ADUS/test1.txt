Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation and Description of Business  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Addus HomeCare Corporation ( Holdings ) and its subsidiaries (together with Holdings, the  Company  or  we ). The Company operates as one business segment and is a provider of comprehensive home and community based services that are primarily personal in nature, which are provided primarily in the home, and focused on the dual eligible (Medicare/Medicaid) population. The Company s services include personal care and assistance with activities of daily living, and adult day care. The Company s consumers are primarily persons who are at risk of hospitalization or institutionalization, such as the elderly, chronically ill and disabled. The Company s payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. The Company currently provides home and community based services to over 32,000 consumers through 122 locations across 21 states, including 5 adult day centers in Illinois.  Principles of Consolidation  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company s investment in entities with less than 20% ownership or in which the Company does not have the ability to influence the operations of the investee are being accounted for using the cost method and are included in investments in joint ventures.  Revenue Recognition  The Company generates net service revenues by providing services directly to consumers. The Company receives payments for providing services from federal, state and local governmental agencies, commercial insurers and private consumers. The Company s services are principally provided based on authorized hours, determined by the relevant agency, at an hourly rate specified in agreements or fixed by legislation and recognized as revenues at the time services are rendered. Home and community based service revenues are reimbursed by state, local and other governmental programs which are partially funded by Medicaid or Medicaid waiver programs, with the remainder reimbursed through private duty and insurance programs.  Laws and regulations governing the Medicaid and Medicare programs are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates may change in the near term. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  The Company establishes its allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected. The Company estimates its provision for doubtful accounts primarily by aging receivables utilizing eight aging categories and applying its historical collection rates to each aging category, taking into consideration factors that might impact the use of historical collection rates or payor groups, with certain large payors analyzed separately from other payor groups. In the Company s evaluation of these estimates, it also considers delays in payment trends in individual states due to budget or funding issues, billing conversions related to acquisitions or internal systems, resubmission of bills with required documentation and disputes with specific payors. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that the Company s management believes is sufficient to cover potential losses. However, actual collections could differ from the Company s estimates.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets by use of the straight-line method except for internally developed software which is amortized by the sum-of-years digits method. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful lives of the property and equipment are as follows:      Goodwill  The Company s carrying value of goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired from various acquisitions including the acquisition of Addus HealthCare, Inc. ( Addus HealthCare ). In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 350,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ,  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur, such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. The Company may use a qualitative test, known as  Step 0,  or a two-step quantitative method to determine whether impairment has occurred. In Step 0, the Company can elect to perform an optional qualitative analysis and based on the results skip the two step analysis. In 2014, the Company elected to implement Step 0 and was not required to conduct the remaining two step analysis. The results of the Company s Step 0 assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore the Company concluded that there were no impairments for the year ended December31, 2014. No impairment charges were recorded for the three or nine months ended September30, 2015 or 2014.  Intangible Assets  The Company s identifiable intangible assets consist of customer and referral relationships, trade names, trademarks, state licenses and non-compete agreements. Amortization is computed using straight-line and accelerated methods based upon the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from two to twenty-fiveyears.    7     Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the estimated economic benefit method over the useful life and assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company would recognize an impairment loss when the estimated future non-discounted cash flows associated with the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. An impairment change would then be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of these intangible assets using the income approach. No impairment charge was recorded for the three or nine months ended September30, 2015 or 2014.  The income approach, which the Company uses to estimate the fair value of its intangible assets (other than goodwill), is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected periods the assets will be utilized, appropriate discount rates and other variables. The Company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions the Company believes to be reasonable but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.  The Company also has indefinite-lived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization expense such as certificates of need and licenses to conduct specific operations within geographic markets. The Company s management has concluded that certificates of need and licenses have indefinite lives, as management has determined that there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, economic or other factors that would limit the useful life of these intangible assets, and the Company intends to renew and operate the certificates of need and licenses indefinitely. The certificates of need and licenses are tested annually for impairment. No impairment was recorded for the three or nine months ended September30, 2015 or 2014.  Workers  Compensation Program  The Company s workers  compensation program has a $350,000 deductible component. The Company recognizes its obligations associated with this program in the period the claim is incurred. The cost of both the claims reported and claims incurred but not reported, up to the deductible, have been accrued based on historical claims experience, industry statistics and an actuarial analysis performed by an independent third party. The future claims payments related to the workers  compensation program are secured by letters of credit.  Interest Income  Legislation enacted in Illinois entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of income as interest income. For the three and nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not receive any prompt payment interest. While the Company may be owed additional prompt payment interest, the amount and timing of receipt of such payments remains uncertain, and the Company has determined that it will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income when received.  Interest Expense  The Company s interest expense consists of interest costs on its credit facility and other debt instruments.  Income Tax Expense  The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  The objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements or tax returns. Deferred taxes, resulting from differences between the financial and tax basis of the Company s assets and liabilities, are also adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. ASC Topic 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. ASC Topic 740, also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, ASC Topic 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions.   Stock-based Compensation  The Company has two stock incentive plans, the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2006 Plan ) and the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2009 Plan ) that provide for stock-based employee compensation. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718,  Stock Compensation.  Compensation expense is recognized on a graded method under the 2006 Plan and on a straight-line basis under the 2009 Plan over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of the options and restricted stock awards. Under the 2006 Plan, the Company historically used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of its stock based payment awards, but beginning October28, 2009 under its 2009 Plan it began using an enhanced Hull-White Trinomial model. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payments utilizing the Black-Scholes model and the Enhanced Hull-White Trinomial model is affected by Holdings  stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected dividends yield, expected forfeiture rate, expected turn-over rate and the expected exercise multiple.  Net Income Per Common Share  Net income per common share, calculated on the treasury stock method, is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The Company s outstanding securities that may potentially dilute the common stock are stock options and restricted stock awards.  Included in the Company s calculation for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015 were 650,000 stock options outstanding, of which 217,000 and 199,000, respectively, were dilutive. In addition, there were 89,000 restricted stock awards outstanding, 23,000 and 5,000 of which were dilutive for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015, respectively.  Included in the Company s calculation for the three and nine months ended September30, 2014 were 646,000 stock options outstanding, of which 208,000 and 216,000, respectively, were dilutive. In addition, there were 60,000 restricted stock awards outstanding, of which 19,000 and 12,000, respectively, were dilutive for the three and nine months ended September30, 2014.  Estimates  The financial statements are prepared by management in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) and include estimated amounts and certain disclosures based on assumptions about future events. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Company s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, payables and debt. The carrying amounts reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the Company s long-term debt with variable interest rates approximates fair value based on instruments with similar terms.    8     The Company applies fair value techniques on a non-recurring basis associated with valuing potential impairment losses related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also when determining the fair value of contingent considerations. To determine the fair value in these situations, the Company uses Level 3 inputs, such as discounted cash flows, or if available, what a market participant would pay on the measurement date.  The Company utilizes the income approach to estimate the fair value of its intangible assets derived from acquisitions. In addition, discounted cash flows were used to estimate the fair value of the Company s investment in joint ventures.  New Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue for which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. In July 2015, the FASB agreed to defer the effective date of the standard from January1, 2017, to January1, 2018, with an option that permits companies to adopt the standard as early as the original effective date. Early application prior to the original effective date is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December15, 2015.  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which will explicitly require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. Currently, there is no guidance in GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this update provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1)provide a definition of the term  substantial doubt , (2)require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3)provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4)require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5)require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and (6)require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this update are effective for the first annual period ending after December15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this update on its financial statements.  Reclassification of Prior Period Balances  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts. Previously, property and equipment acquired through certain capital lease obligations had been classified as borrowings on capital lease obligations under cash flows from financing activities and as a purchase of property and equipment under investing activities on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Because ASC 230-10-50-5 requires that for transactions that are part cash and part non-cash, only the cash portion shall be reported in the statement of cash flows, the Company revised the portion of the classification for which its lessor paid the vendors directly to instead be presented as a supplemental disclosure under non-cash investing and financing activities.  2. Acquisitions  On April24, 2015, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire South Shore Home Health Service, Inc. and Acaring Home Care, LLC for approximately $18,000,000 to expand into the State of New York. The purchase agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company s March31, 2015 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Statements made herein with respect to the purchase agreement are not complete and you should refer to the previously filed Exhibit 10.1 for a copy of the actual agreement. The related acquisition costs to date are $488,000 and are expensed as incurred.  Effective January1, 2015, the Company acquired Priority Home Health Care, Inc. ( PHHC ), in order to further expand the Company s presence in the State of Ohio. The total consideration for the transaction was comprised of $4,250,000 in cash. The related acquisition costs were $454,000 and were expensed as incurred. The results of operations from this acquired entity are included in the Company s statement of income from the date of the acquisition.   The Company s acquisition of PHHC has been accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations,  and the resultant goodwill and other intangible assets will be accounted for under ASC Topic 350  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.  The acquisition was recorded at its fair value as of January1, 2015. The total purchase price is $4,250,000. Under business combination accounting, the total purchase price will be allocated to PHHC s net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. Based upon management s preliminary valuation, the total purchase price has been allocated as follows:      Management s assessment of qualitative factors affecting goodwill for PHHC includes: estimates of market share at the date of purchase; ability to grow in the market; synergy with existing Company operations and the presence of managed care payors in the market.  Identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of trade names and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements. The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets was determined by the Company s management. It is anticipated that the net intangible and identifiable intangible assets, including goodwill, are deductible for tax purposes. These estimates are provisional and are subject to change.  The PHHC acquisition accounted for $2,500,000 and $7,160,000 of net service revenues for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015, respectively.    9     Effective June1, 2014, the Company acquired Cura Partners, LLC, which conducts business under the name Aid& Assist at Home, LLC ( Aid& Assist ), in order to further expand the Company s presence in the State of Tennessee. The total consideration for the transaction was $8,192,000, comprised of $7,172,000 in cash and $1,020,000, representing the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out obligation. The related acquisition costs were $508,000 and were expensed as incurred. The results of operations from this acquired entity are included in the Company s statement of income from the date of the acquisition.  The Company s acquisition of Aid& Assist has been accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations,  and the resultant goodwill and other intangible assets will be accounted for under ASC Topic 350  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets .  The acquisition was recorded at its fair value as of June1, 2014. The total purchase price is $8,192,000 and is comprised of:      As of June1, 2014, the contingent earn-out obligation was recorded at its fair value of $1,020,000, which was the present value of the Company s obligation to pay up to $1,168,000 based on probability-weighted estimates of the achievement of certain performance targets, as defined in the earn-out agreement between the parties. As of December31, 2014, the Company revalued this liability at $200,000. This decline in the fair value of the contingent earn-out obligation reflects the acquisition s failure to achieve performance targets expected at the date of acquisition for 2014 and the expectation that the acquisition will fail to achieve performance targets in 2015 and 2016.    10     Under business combination accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to Aid& Assist s net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. Based upon management s valuation, the total purchase price has been allocated as follows:      Management s assessment of qualitative factors affecting goodwill for Aid& Assist includes: estimates of market share at the date of purchase; ability to grow in the market; synergy with existing Company operations and the presence of managed care payors in the market.  Identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of trade names and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements. The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets was determined by the Company s management. It is anticipated that the net intangible and identifiable intangible assets, including goodwill, are deductible for tax purposes.  The Aid& Assist acquisition accounted for $2,524,000 and $8,231,000 of net service revenues for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015, respectively, and $3,295,000 and $4,358,000 of net service revenues from operations for the three and nine months ended September30, 2014, respectively.  The Company entered into two definitive acquisition agreements to acquire home and community based businesses during 2013 to further its presence in both existing states and to expand into new states. On October17, 2013 the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the entire home and community based business of Medi Home Private Care Division of Medical Services of America, Inc. The acquisition included two agencies located in South Carolina which were closed effective November1, 2013; four agencies located in Tennessee and two agencies located in Ohio which closed in January 2014. The Company also entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the assets of Coordinated Home Health Care, LLC, a personal care business located in New Mexico ( CHHC ), on November7, 2013. The combined consideration for these two acquisitions was $12,325,000 in cash at the close and a maximum of $2,250,000 in future cash based on certain performance. The purchase included sixteen offices located in Southern New Mexico. The transaction closed effective December1, 2013. The related acquisitions costs were $735,000 for the Medi Home Private Care Division of Medical Services of America, Inc. and CHHC deals, and were expensed as incurred. The results of operations from these acquired entities are included in our statement of income from the dates of the respective acquisitions.  The Company s acquisition of the assets of CHHC has been accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations  and the resultant goodwill and other intangible assets will be accounted for under ASC Topic 350  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of December1, 2013. The total purchase price was $12,825,000 and was comprised of:      As of December1, 2013, the contingent earn-out obligation was recorded at its fair value of $1,100,000, which was the present value of the Company s obligation to pay up to $2,250,000 based on probability-weighted estimates of the achievement of certain performance targets, as defined in the earn-out agreement between the parties. As of December31, 2014, the Company revalued this liability at $1,920,000. This increase in the fair value of the contingent earn-out obligation reflects the acquisition s excess achievement of performance targets for the year ended December31, 2014 as a result of higher than anticipated rate of conversion to managed care organizations in the State of New Mexico. As of September30, 2015, the contingent earn-out obligation was recorded at its fair value of $1,250,000. The Company increased this liability by $130,000 to accrue to the maximum earn-out obligation based on probability-weighted estimates of the achievement of certain performance targets, as defined in the earn-out agreement between the parties. $1,000,000 of the liability, which was recorded as the current portion at December31, 2014, was subsequently paid during the second quarter of 2015.    11     Under business combination accounting, the total purchase price was allocated to CHHC s net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. Based upon management s valuation, the total purchase price was allocated as follows:      Management s assessment of qualitative factors affecting goodwill for CHHC includes: estimates of market share at the date of purchase; ability to grow in the market; synergy with existing Company operations and the presence of managed care payors in the market.  Identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of trade names and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements. The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets was determined by management. It is anticipated that the net intangible and identifiable intangible assets, including goodwill, are deductible for tax purposes.  Acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter 2013 accounted for $6,245,000 and $18,116,000 of net service revenues for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015, respectively, and $5,821,000 and $16,004,000 of net service revenues for the three and nine months ended September30 2014, respectively.  3. Goodwill and Intangible Assets  The Company s carrying value of goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired from various acquisitions including the acquisition of Addus HealthCare. In accordance with ASC Topic 350,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of October1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur, such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that impairment may have occurred.  Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. The Company can elect to perform Step 0, an optional qualitative analysis and based on the results skip the remaining two steps. In 2014, the Company elected to implement Step 0 and was not required to conduct the remaining two step analysis. In performing its goodwill assessment for 2014, the Company evaluated the following factors that affect future business performance: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, entity-specific events, reporting unit factors and company stock price. As a result of the assessments of these qualitative factors, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting unit goodwill as of December31, 2014 exceed the carrying values of the unit. Accordingly, the first and second steps of the goodwill impairment test as described in ASC 350-20-35, which includes estimating the fair values of the Company, were not considered necessary.  The Company did not record any impairment charges for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015. The Company will perform its annual impairment test for fiscal 2015 during the fourth quarter of 2015.  A summary of the goodwill activity for the nine months ended September30, 2015 is provided below:      Adjustments to the previously recorded goodwill are primarily credits related to amortization of tax goodwill in excess of book basis.  The Company s identifiable intangible assets consist of customer and referral relationships, trade names, trademarks, state licenses and non-compete agreements. Amortization is computed using straight-line and accelerated methods based upon the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from two to twenty-five years.  The Company also has indefinite-lived assets that are not subject to amortization expense such as licenses and in certain states certificates of need to conduct specific operations within geographic markets. The Company has concluded these assets have indefinite lives, as management has determined that there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, economic or other factors that would limit the useful life of these intangible assets and the Company intends to renew the licenses indefinitely. The licenses and certificates of need are tested annually for impairment using the cost approach. Under this method assumptions are made about the cost to replace the certificates of need. No impairment charges were recorded in the three and nine months ended September30, 2015 or 2014.    12     The carrying amount and accumulated amortization of each identifiable intangible asset category consisted of the following at September30, 2015 and December31, 2014:      Amortization expense related to the identifiable intangible assets amounted to $767,000 and $2,244,000 for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015, respectively, and $710,000 and $1,719,000 for the three and nine months ended September30, 2014, respectively. Goodwill and state licenses are not amortized pursuant to ASC Topic 350.  4. Details of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts  Prepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following:      Accrued expenses consisted of the following:           (1)  The Company provides health insurance coverage to qualified union employees providing home and community based services in Illinois through a Taft-Hartley multi-employer health and welfare plan under Section302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. The Company s insurance contributions equal the amount reimbursed by the State of Illinois. Contributions are due within five business days from the date the funds are received from the State. Amounts due of $996,000 and $2,404,000 for health insurance reimbursements and contributions were reflected in prepaid insurance and accrued insurance at September30, 2015 and December31, 2014, respectively.    (2)  As a condition of the sale of substantially all of the assets used in the Company s home health business to subsidiaries of LHC Group. Inc. ( LHCG ) in February 2013, the Company is responsible for any adjustments to Medicare and Medicaid billings prior to the closing. In connection with an internal evaluation of the Company s billing processes, the Company discovered documentation errors in a number of claims that it had submitted to Medicare. Consistent with applicable law, the Company voluntarily remitted $1,840,000 to the U.S. government in March 2014. The Company, using its best judgment, has estimated a total of $1,203,000 for billing adjustments remaining.   5. Long-Term Debt  Capital Leases  On July12, 2014, September11, 2014 and April13, 2015, the Company executed three 48-month capital lease agreements for $2,650,000, $1,428,000 and $378,000, respectively, with First American Commercial Bancorp, Inc. The capital leases were entered into to finance property and equipment at the Company s new corporate headquarters in Downers Grove, IL. The underlying assets are included in  Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These capital lease obligations require monthly payments through September 2018 and have implicit interest rates that range from 3.0% to 3.6%. At the end of the term, the Company has the option to purchase the assets for $1 per lease agreement.    13     The following is an analysis of the leased property under capital leases by major classes.      The future minimum payments for capital leases as of September30, 2015 are as follows:           (a)  Amount necessary to reduce net minimum lease payments to present value calculated at the Company s incremental borrowing rate at lease inception.    (b)  Reflected in the balance sheet as current and noncurrent obligations under capital leases of $1,100,000 and $2,162,000, respectively.  Senior Secured Credit Facility  On August11, 2014, the Company renewed its credit facility. The Company s credit facility provides a $55,000,000 revolving line of credit expiring November2, 2019 and includes a $27,500,000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. On November6, 2014, the Company amended its credit facility, with retroactive effect to September30, 2014. The credit facility was amended to (i)reduce the floating interest rate from one-month LIBOR, plus a margin of 4.6% to one-month LIBOR, plus a margin of 3.5%, (ii)reduce the interest rate for loans based on term periods of one, two or three months from the LIBOR rate, plus a margin of 4.6% to the LIBOR rate, plus a margin of 3.5% and (iii)increase the allowed capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending 2014 from $5,000,000 to $7,000,000. Substantially all of the subsidiaries of Holdings are co-borrowers, and Holdings has guaranteed the borrowers  obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in all of Holdings  and the borrowers  current and future tangible and intangible assets, including the shares of stock of the borrowers.  The availability of funds under the revolving portion of the credit facility, as amended, is based on the lesser of (i)the product of adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, for the most recent 12-month period for which financial statements have been delivered under the credit agreement multiplied by the specified advance multiple, up to 3.25, less the outstanding senior indebtedness and letters of credit, and (ii)$55,000,000 less the outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit. Interest on the revolving line of credit may be payable at (i)a floating rate equal to the one-month LIBOR, plus a margin of 3.5%, (ii)the LIBOR rate for term periods of one, two or three months, plus a margin of 3.5% or (iii)the base rate, plus a margin of 1.6%, where the base rate is equal to the greatest of (a)the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the  prime rate,  (b)the sum of the federal funds rate, plus a margin of 0.5% and (c)the sum of the adjusted LIBOR that would be applicable to a loan with a one month interest period advanced on such day, plus a margin of 3%. The Company pays a fee equal to 0.5%per annum of the unused portion of the revolving portion of the credit facility. Issued stand-by letters of credit are charged at a rate of 2.0%per annum payable monthly. The Company did not have any amounts outstanding on the revolving portion of the credit facility as of September30, 2015, and the total availability under the revolving credit loan facility reduced by the outstanding letters of credit was $41,504,000 and $39,536,000, as of September30, 2015 and December31, 2014, respectively.   The credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants regarding, among other things, the maintenance of records, compliance with laws, maintenance of permits, maintenance of insurance and property and payment of taxes. The credit facility also contains certain customary financial covenants and negative covenants that, among other things, include a requirement to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a requirement to stay below a maximum senior leverage ratio and a requirement to stay below a maximum permitted amount of capital expenditures, as well as restrictions on guarantees, indebtedness, liens, distributions, investments and loans, subject to customary carve outs, a restriction on dividends (unless no default then exists or would occur as a result thereof, the Company is in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility after giving effect thereto, and the Company has an excess availability of at least 10% of the revolving credit commitment under the credit facility), restrictions on the Company s ability to enter into transactions other than in the ordinary course of business, a restriction on the ability to consummate more than three acquisitions in any calendar year, or for the purchase price of any one acquisition to exceed $2,000,000, in each case without the consent of the lenders, restrictions on mergers, transfers of assets, acquisitions, equipment, subsidiaries and affiliate transactions, subject to customary carve outs, and restrictions on fundamental changes and lines of business.    14     6. Income Taxes  A reconciliation of the statutory federal tax rate of 35.0% for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014 is summarized as follows:      7. Commitments and Contingencies  Legal Proceedings  The Company is a party to legal and/or administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of such proceedings will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position and results of operations.  Employment Agreements  The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain members of senior management. The terms of these agreements are up to four years and include non-compete and nondisclosure provisions, as well as provide for defined severance payments in the event of termination.  A substantial percentage of the Company s workforce is represented by the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ). The Company has a national agreement with the SEIU. Wages and benefits are negotiated at the local level at various times throughout the year. These negotiations are often initiated when the Company receives increases in hourly rates from various state agencies. Upon expiration of these collective bargaining agreements, the Company may not be able to negotiate labor agreements on satisfactory terms with these labor unions.  8. Significant Payors  A substantial portion of the Company s net service revenues and accounts receivables are derived from services performed for federal, state and local governmental agencies. The Illinois Department on Aging accounted for 50.0% and 52.1% of the Company s net service revenues for the three months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The Illinois Department on Aging accounted for 48.6% and 53.7% of the Company s net service revenues for the nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The related receivables due from the Illinois Department on Aging represented 51.3% of the Company s accounts receivable at September30, 2015 and 54.2% of the Company s accounts receivable at December31, 2014.  9. Concentration of Cash  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company maintains cash with financial institutions which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash.    15

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  You should read the following discussion together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate.  Overview  We operate as one business segment and are a provider of comprehensive home and community based services that are primarily personal in nature, which are provided primarily in the home, and focused on the dual eligible (Medicare/Medicaid) population. Our services include personal care and assistance with activities of daily living, and adult day care. Our consumers are primarily persons who are at risk of hospitalization or institutionalization, such as the elderly, chronically ill and disabled. Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. We currently provide home and community based services to over 33,000 consumers through 122 locations across 21 states, including 5 adult day centers in Illinois. For the three and nine months ended September30, 2015, we served over 35,000 and 44,000 consumers, respectively.  A summary of our financial results for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014 is provided in the table below:      Historically our services were provided under agreements with state and local government agencies established to meet the needs of our consumers. Our consumers are predominately  dual eligible  and as such are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid funded home-based care. As a result of certain legislation enacted by the federal government, states are being incentivized to initiate dual eligible demonstration programs and other managed Medicaid initiatives, which are designed to coordinate the services provided through these two programs, with the overall objectives to better coordinate service delivery and over the long term to reduce costs. Increasingly states are implementing these managed care programs and as such are transitioning management of individuals such as our consumers to local and national managed care organizations. Under these arrangements the managed care organizations have an economic incentive to provide home and community based services to consumers as a means to better manage the acute care expenditures of their membership.  The home and community based services we provide include assistance with bathing, grooming, dressing, personal hygiene and medication reminders, and other activities of daily living. We provide these services on a long-term, continuous basis, with an average duration of approximately 20 monthsper consumer. Our adult day centers provide a comprehensive program of skilled and support services and designated medical services for adults in a community-based group setting. Services provided by our adult day centers include social activities, transportation services to and from the centers, the provision of meals and snacks, personal care and therapeutic activities such as exercise and cognitive interaction.  We utilize a coordinated care model that is designed to improve consumer outcomes and satisfaction, as well as lower the cost of acute care treatment and reduce service duplication.We believe this coordinated care model to be especially valuable to managed care organizations that have economic responsibility for both home and community services as well as acute care expenditures. Over the long term, we believe this model will be a differentiator and as a result we expect to receive increased referrals from the managed care organizations.   Through our coordinated care model, we utilize our home care aides to observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of early intervention in the disease process, thereby preventing or reducing the cost of medical services by avoiding emergency room visits, and/or reducing the need for hospitalization. We coordinate the services provided by our team with those of other health care agencies as appropriate. Changes in consumers  conditions are evaluated by appropriately trained managers and referred to either appropriate medical personnel including the consumers  primary care physicians or managed care organizations for treatment and follow-up. We believe this approach to the care to our consumers and the integration of our services into the broader healthcare continuum are attractive to managed care organizations and others who are ultimately responsible for the healthcare needs and costs of our consumers and over time will increase our business with them.  We are investing in technology based solutions to support and facilitate our coordinated care model.We utilize Integrated Voice Response ( IVR ) systems and smart phone applications to communicate with the homecare aides. A quarter of our employees utilize this technology and our plans are to increase the use of these software applications throughout the broader workforce. Through these applications we are able to identify changes in health conditions with automated alerts forwarded to appropriate management team for triaging and evaluation.In addition, the technology is used to record basic transaction information about each visit including: start and end times to a scheduled shift, mileage reimbursement, text messages to the homecare aide and communication of basic payroll information.Our plans for this technology include development of a web portal to provide the ability to communicate this basic information about individual clients to the managed care organizations.  In addition to our focus on organic growth, we are growing through selective acquisitions which expand our presence in current markets or which facilitate our entry into new markets where the home and community business is moving to managed care organizations. We completed two acquisitions in December 2013 and June 2014 that expanded our presence in two existing markets and provided us with a base of operations in two new targeted managed care states. On January1, 2015, we acquired Priority Home Health Care, Inc., a company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio and operating six offices in the Cleveland, Akron and Columbus areas. Additionally, on April24, 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire South Shore Home Service, Inc. and Acaring Home Care, LLC to expand into the State of New York.    16     Business  As of September30, 2015, we provided our home and community based services through 122 locations across 21 states including 5 adult day centers in Illinois.  Our payor clients are principally federal, state and local governmental agencies and, increasingly, managed care organizations. The federal, state and local programs under which the agencies operate are subject to legislative, budgetary and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates. We are experiencing a further transition of business from government payors to managed care organizations with which we are seeking to grow our business given our emphasis on coordinated care and the prevention of acute care. Managed care organizations are commercial insurance carriers who are under contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to manage the provision of home and community based services, improve the quality of care through prevention and provide a network for the delivery of health benefits and additional services. Their objective is to lower total health care costs by integrating the provision of home and community based services with those benefit programs responsible for the provision of acute care services to their consumers. We are also seeking to grow our private duty business. Our commercial insurance carrier payor clients are typically for-profit companies and are continuously seeking opportunities to control costs.  For the three and nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014 our payor revenue mix was:      We derive a significant amount of our net service revenues from our operations in Illinois, which represented 60.4% and 60.0% of our total net service revenues for the three months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Net service revenues from our operations in Illinois represented 59.1% and 60.8% of our total net service revenues for the nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  A significant amount of our net service revenues are derived from one payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 50.0% and 52.1% of our total net service revenues for the three months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Illinois Department on Aging accounted for 48.6 % and 53.7% of our total net service revenues for the nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  We measure the performance of our business using a number of different metrics, including billable hours, billable hours per business day, revenues per billable hour and the number of consumers, or census.  Components of our Statements of Income  Net Service Revenues  We generate net service revenues by providing our services directly to consumers and primarily on an hourly basis. We receive payment for providing such services from our payor clients, including federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers. Net service revenues are principally provided based on authorized hours, determined by the relevant agency, at an hourly rate which is either contractual or fixed by legislation or contract, and recognized as net service revenues at the time services are rendered.  Cost of Service Revenues  We incur direct care wages, payroll taxes and benefit-related costs in connection with providing our services. We also provide workers  compensation and general liability coverage for these employees.  Employees are also reimbursed for their travel time and related travel costs.  General and Administrative Expenses  Our general and administrative expenses include our costs for operating our network of local agencies and our centralized support center.  Our agency expenses consist of costs for supervisory personnel, our community care supervisors and office administrative costs.Personnel costs include wages, payroll taxes, and employee benefits.Facility costs including rents, utilities, postage, telephone and office expenses.Our centralized support center includes costs for accounting, information systems including software development, human resources, billing and collections, contracting, marketing, our contact center and executive leadership.These expenses consist of compensation, including stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, employee benefits, legal, accounting and other professional fees, travel, general insurance, rents and related facility costs.  Depreciation and Amortization Expenses  We amortize our intangible assets with finite lives, consisting of customer and referral relationships, trade names, trademarks and non-compete agreements, principally using accelerated methods based upon their estimated useful lives. Depreciable assets consist principally of furniture and equipment, network administration and telephone equipment, and operating system software. Depreciable and leasehold assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line method over their useful lives or, if less and if applicable, their lease terms.  Interest Income  Legislation enacted in Illinois entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of income as interest income.  Interest Expense  Interest expense consists of interest costs on our credit facility, capital lease obligations and other debt instruments and is reported in the statement of income when incurred.    17     Income Tax Expense  All of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. The differences from the federal statutory rate of 35.0% for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014 are principally due to the inclusion of state and local taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits that lower our effective tax rate.  Results of Operations  Three Months Ended September30, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended September30, 2014  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our unaudited consolidated results of operations.      Net service revenues from state, local and other governmental programs accounted for 78.1% and 85.9% of net service revenues for the three months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Managed care organizations accounted for 18.1% and 9.5% of net service revenues for the three months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with private duty and commercial payors accounting for the remainder of net service revenues.  Net service revenues increased $2,673,000, or 3.3%, to $84,331,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $81,658,000 for the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a 1.2% increase in average billable census and a 1.9% increase in revenues per billable hour. Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, increased to 27.9% for the third quarter of 2015, compared to 26.7% for the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to improved workers  compensation experience.  General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues increased to 21.4% for the three months ended September30, 2015, from 19.3% for the three months ended September30, 2014. General and administrative expenses increased to $18,041,000 as compared to $15,773,000 for the three months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses was due to an increase in costs related to wages, payroll taxes, stock compensation expenses, and increased expenditures related to legal, consulting, temporary office personnel and the ongoing installation of our new human resources and payroll information system for the three months ended September30, 2015 as compared to 2014.  Depreciation and amortization, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, remained consistent at 1.4% for the third quarter of 2015 and 2014. Amortization of intangibles, which are principally amortized using accelerated methods, totaled $767,000 and $710,000 for the three months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.    18     Nine Months Ended September30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September30, 2014      Net service revenues from state, local and other governmental programs accounted for 77.8% and 88.6% of net service revenues for the nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Managed care organizations accounted for 18.2% and 6.8% of net service revenues for the nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with private duty and commercial payors accounting for the remainder of net service revenues.  Net service revenues increased $21,749,000, or 9.4%, to $252,055,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $230,306,000 for the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a 0.2% increase in average billable census and a 1.1% increase in revenues per billable hour. Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, increased to 27.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to 26.5% for the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to improved workers  compensation experience.  General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues increased to 20.9% for the nine months ended September30, 2015, from 19.8% for the nine months ended September30, 2014. General and administrative expenses increased to $52,617,000 as compared to $45,576,000 for the nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses was due to an increase in costs related to wages, payroll taxes and stock compensation expenses, and increased expenditures related to legal, consulting, temporary office personnel and the ongoing installation of our new human resources and payroll information system for the nine months ended September30, 2015 as compared to 2014.  Depreciation and amortization, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, increased to 1.4% from 1.2% for the nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Amortization of intangibles, which are principally amortized using accelerated methods, totaled $2,244,000 and $1,719,000 for the nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Interest Income  Legislation enacted in Illinois entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the income statement caption,  interest income . We received no prompt payment interest for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015 or 2014. We do not anticipate that we will be owed additional prompt payment interest.    19     Interest Expense, Net  Interest expense, net, decreased to $163,000 from $180,000 for the three months ended September30, 2015 as compared to September30, 2014. For the nine months ended September30, 2014 as compared to September30, 2015, interest expense, net increased to $505,000 from $484,000. The increase is primarily as a result of the capital lease agreements entered into on July12, 2014, September11, 2014 and April13, 2015. See Note 5 to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Long-Term Debt for additional information.  Income Tax Expense  Our effective tax rates for the three months ended September30, 2015 and 2014 were 29.9% and 32.3%, respectively. The principal difference between the federal and state statutory rates and our effective tax rate is attributable to federal employment opportunity tax credits.  Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014 were 33.6% and 32.6%, respectively. The principal difference between the Federal and State statutory rates and our effective tax rate is attributable to federal employment opportunity tax credits.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Overview  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility. We renewed our credit facility on the terms described below on August11, 2014. At September30, 2015 and December31, 2014, we had cash balances of $14,877,000 and $13,363,000, respectively.  As of September30, 2015 and December31, 2014, we had no balances outstanding under the revolving credit portion of our credit facility. After giving effect to approximately $13,496,000 and $15,464,000 of outstanding letters of credit as of September30, 2015 and December31, 2014, respectively, and borrowing limits based on an advanced multiple of adjusted EBITDA, we had $41,504,000 and $39,536,000 available for borrowing under the credit facility as of September30, 2015 and December31, 2014, respectively.  Cash flows from operating activities represent the inflow of cash from our payor clients and the outflow of cash for payroll and payroll taxes, operating expenses, interest and taxes. Due to its revenue deficiencies and financing issues, from time to time the State of Illinois has reimbursed us on a delayed basis with respect to our various agreements including with our largest payor, the Illinois Department on Aging. The open receivable balance from the State of Illinois increased by $1,640,000, from $44,136,000 as of December31, 2014 to $45,776,000 as of September30, 2015.  The State of Illinois  payments have been sporadic and delayed in the past. Should payments become further delayed in the future, the delays could adversely impact our liquidity and may result in the need to increase borrowings under our credit facility. Since the end of the third quarter, we collected an additional $17,005,000 in accounts receivable from the State of Illinois.  Credit Facility  On August11, 2014, we renewed our credit facility. Our credit facility provides a $55,000,000 revolving line of credit expiring November2, 2019 and includes a $27,500,000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. On November6, 2014, we amended our credit facility, with retroactive effect to September30, 2014. The credit facility was amended to (i)reduce the floating interest rate from one-month LIBOR, plus a margin of 4.6% to one-month LIBOR, plus a margin of 3.5%, (ii)reduce the interest rate for loans based on term periods of one, two or three months from the LIBOR rate, plus a margin of 4.6% to the LIBOR rate, plus a margin of 3.5% and (iii)increase the allowed capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending 2014 from $5,000,000 to $7,000,000. Substantially all of the subsidiaries of Holdings are co-borrowers, and Holdings has guaranteed the borrowers  obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in all of Holdings  and the borrowers  current and future tangible and intangible assets, including the shares of stock of the borrowers.  The availability of funds under the revolving credit portion of the credit facility, as amended, is based on the lesser of (i)the product of adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, for the most recent 12-month period for which financial statements have been delivered under the credit agreement multiplied by the specified advance multiple, up to 3.25, less the outstanding senior indebtedness and letters of credit, and (ii)$55,000,000 less the outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit. Interest on the revolving line of credit may be payable at (i)a floating rate equal to the one-month LIBOR, plus a margin of 3.5%, (ii)the LIBOR rate for term periods of one, two or three months, plus a margin of 3.5% or (iii)the base rate, plus a margin of 1.6%, where the base rate is equal to the greatest of (a)the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the  prime rate , (b)the sum of the federal funds rate, plus a margin of 0.5% and (c)the sum of the adjusted LIBOR that would be applicable to a loan with a one month interest period advanced on such day, plus a margin of 3.0%. We pay a fee equal to 0.5%per annum of the unused portion of the revolving portion of the credit facility. Issued stand-by letters of credit are charged at a rate of 2.0%per annum payable monthly. We did not have any amounts outstanding on the revolving portion of the credit facility as of September30, 2015, and the total availability under the revolving credit loan facility reduced by the outstanding letters of credit was $41,504,000 and $39,536,000, as of September30, 2015 and December31, 2014, respectively.  The credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants regarding, among other things, the maintenance of records, compliance with laws, maintenance of permits, maintenance of insurance and property and payment of taxes. The credit facility also contains certain customary financial covenants and negative covenants that, among other things, include a requirement to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a requirement to stay below a maximum senior leverage ratio and a requirement to stay below a maximum permitted amount of capital expenditures, as well as restrictions on guarantees, indebtedness, liens, distributions, investments and loans, subject to customary carve outs, a restriction on dividends (unless no default then exists or would occur as a result thereof, we are in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility after giving effect thereto, and we have an excess availability of at least 10% of the revolving credit commitment under the credit facility), restrictions on our ability to enter into transactions other than in the ordinary course of business, a restriction on the ability to consummate more than three acquisitions in any calendar year, or for the purchase price of any one acquisition to exceed $2,000,000, in each case without the consent of the lenders, restrictions on mergers, transfers of assets, acquisitions, equipment, subsidiaries and affiliate transactions, subject to customary carve outs, and restrictions on fundamental changes and lines of business.  While our growth is not entirely dependent on acquisitions, if we do not have sufficient cash resources or availability under our credit facility, or we are otherwise prohibited from making acquisitions, our growth could be limited unless we obtain additional equity or debt financing or the necessary consents from our lenders. We believe the available borrowings under our credit facility which, combined with cash from operations, will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs for at least the next 12months.    20     Cash Flows  The following table summarizes changes in our cash flows for the nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014:      Nine Months Ended September30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September30, 2014  Net cash provided by operating activities was $8,786,000 for the nine months ended September30, 2015, compared to cash provided by operations of $7,590,000 for the same period in 2014. This increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to an increase in accrued expenses which was offset by a decrease in accounts receivable during this period.  Net cash used in investing activities was $5,712,000 for the nine months ended September30, 2015 compared to cash used in investing activities of $12,012,000 for the nine months ended September30, 2014. Our investing activities for the nine months ended September30, 2015 were $1,316,000 in purchases of property and equipment to invest in our technology infrastructure, $4,250,000 for the acquisition of Priority Home Healthcare, Inc. as previously described in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) and $146,000 for the acquisition of a customer list. Our investing activities for the nine months ended September30, 2014 were purchases of property and equipment related to our new corporate headquarters in Downers Grove, IL and a new payroll system, the acquisition of Aid& Assist as described in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited), and the acquisition of a customer list.  Net cash used in financing activities was $1,560,000 for the nine months ended September30, 2015 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2,981,000 for the nine months ended September30, 2014. Our financing activities for the nine months ended September30, 2015 were a $1,000,000 payment on the CHHC contingent earn-out obligation as previously described in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited), $779,000 of payments on capital lease obligations and $86,000 payment for debt issuance costs and $305,000 of cash received for the exercise of employee stock options. Our financing activity for the nine months ended September30, 2014 was primarily related to capital lease obligations to finance purchases of property and equipment related to our corporate headquarters in Downers Grove, IL.  Outstanding Accounts Receivable  Gross accounts receivable as of September30, 2015 and December31, 2014 were approximately $82,583,000 and $72,214,000, respectively. Outstanding accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, increased by $10,062,000 as of September30, 2015 as compared to December31, 2014. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributable to delay in payment from the state of Illinois during the third quarter of 2015.  We establish our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected. Our provision for doubtful accounts is estimated and recorded primarily by aging receivables utilizing eight aging categories and applying our historical collection rates to each aging category, taking into consideration factors that might impact the use of historical collection rates or payor groups, with certain large payors analyzed separately from other payor groups. In our evaluation of these estimates, we also consider other factors including: delays in payment trends in individual states due to budget or funding issues; billing conversions related to acquisitions or internal systems; resubmission of bills with required documentation and disputes with specific payors. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that our management believes is sufficient to cover potential losses. However, actual collections could differ from our estimates.  Our collection procedures include review of account aging and direct contact with our payors. We have historically not used collection agencies. An uncollectible amount is written off to the allowance account after reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted.  The following tables detail our accounts receivable before reserves by payor category, showing Illinois governmental payors separately, and the related allowance amount at September30, 2015 and December31, 2014:        21      We calculate our days sales outstanding ( DSO ) by taking the accounts receivable outstanding net of the allowance for doubtful accounts divided by the total net service revenues for the last quarter, multiplied by the number of days in that quarter. Our DSOs were 86 days and 80 days at September30, 2015 and December31, 2014, respectively. The DSOs for our largest payor, the Illinois Department on Aging, at September30, 2015 and December31, 2014 were 92 days and 85 days, respectively. We may not receive payments on a consistent basis in the near term and our DSOs and the DSO for the Illinois Department on Aging may increase. The change in the reserve as a percentage of gross accounts receivable to 5.1% as of September30, 2015 from 5.4% as of December31, 2014 is attributable to other state, local and other governmental programs and managed care organizations increase in total accounts receivable as well as improved aging.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of September30, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet guarantees or arrangements with unconsolidated entities.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expense and related disclosures. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other sources and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider the items discussed below to be critical because of their impact on operations and their application requires our judgment and estimates.  Revenue Recognition  The majority of our revenues for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015 and 2014 are derived from Medicaid and Medicaid waiver programs under agreements with various state and local authorities. These agreements provide for a service term from one year to an indefinite term. Services are provided based on authorized hours, determined by the relevant state or local agency, at an hourly rate specified in the agreement or fixed by legislation. Services to other payors, such as private or commercial clients, are provided at negotiated hourly rates and recognized in net service revenues as services are provided. We provide for appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts at the time the services are rendered.  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  We are paid for our services primarily by state and local agencies under Medicaid or Medicaid waiver programs, managed care organizations, commercial insurance companies and private consumers. While our accounts receivable are uncollateralized, our credit risk is somewhat limited due to the significance of governmental payors to our results of operations. Laws and regulations governing the governmental programs in which we participate are complex and subject to interpretation. Amounts collected may be different than amounts billed due to client eligibility issues, insufficient or incomplete documentation, services at levels other than authorized and other reasons unrelated to credit risk.  Legislation enacted in Illinois entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the income statement caption, interest income. We did not receive any prompt payment interest for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015 or 2014.  We establish our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated and recorded primarily by aging receivables utilizing eight aging categories and applying our historical collection rates to each aging category, taking into consideration factors that might impact the use of historical collection rates or payor groups, with certain large payors analyzed separately from other payor groups. In our evaluation of these estimates, we also consider delays in payment trends in individual states due to budget or funding issues, billing conversions related to acquisitions or internal systems, resubmission of bills with required documentation and disputes with specific payors. Historically, we have not experienced any write-off of accounts as a result of a state operating with budget deficits. While we regularly monitor state budget and funding developments for the states in which we operate, we consider losses due to state credit risk on outstanding balances as remote. We believe that our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover potential losses; however, actual collections in subsequent periods may require changes to our estimates.  Goodwill  Our carrying value of goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired from various acquisitions including the acquisition of Addus HealthCare, Inc. ( Addus HealthCare ). In accordance with ASC Topic 350,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur, such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. We may use a qualitative test, known as  Step 0,  or a two-step quantitative method to determine whether impairment has occurred. We can elect to perform Step 0, an optional qualitative analysis, and based on the results skip the remaining two steps. In 2014, we elected to implement Step 0. The results of our Step 0 assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore we concluded that there were no impairments for the year ended December31, 2014. No impairment charges were recorded for the three or nine months ended September30, 2015 or 2014.    22     Long-Lived Assets  We review our long-lived assets and finite lived intangibles for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. To determine if impairment exists, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the related long-lived assets to the net carrying amount of such assets. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset, generally determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows. No impairment charge was recorded for the year ended December31, 2014 or the three or nine months ended September30, 2015 or 2014.  Indefinite-lived Assets  We also have indefinite-lived assets that are not subject to amortization expense such as licenses and in certain states certificates of need to conduct specific operations within geographic markets. Our management has concluded that these assets have indefinite lives, as management has determined that there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, economic or other factors that would limit the useful life of these intangible assets and we intend to renew the licenses indefinitely. The licenses and certificates of need are tested annually for impairment. No impairment was recorded for the year ended December31, 2014 or the three or nine months ended September30, 2015 or 2014.  Workers  Compensation Program  Our workers  compensation insurance program has a $350,000 deductible component. We recognize our obligations associated with this program in the period the claim is incurred. The cost of both the claims reported and claims incurred but not reported, up to the deductible, have been accrued based on historical claims experience, industry statistics and an actuarial analysis performed by an independent third party. We monitor our claims quarterly and adjust our reserves accordingly. These costs are recorded primarily in the cost of services caption in the condensed consolidated statement of income. Under the agreement pursuant to which we acquired Addus HealthCare, claims under our workers  compensation insurance program that related to December31, 2005 or earlier were the responsibility of the selling shareholders in the acquisition, subject to certain limitations. The responsibility of the selling shareholders for these claims was terminated on December29, 2014. In August 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No 2010-24, Health Care Entities (Topic 954),  Presentation of Insurance Claims and Related Insurance Recoveries  ( ASU 2010-24 ), which clarifies that companies should not net insurance recoveries against a related claim liability. Additionally, the amount of the claim liability should be determined without consideration of insurance recoveries. As of September30, 2015 and December31, 2014, we recorded $3,157,000 and $1,457,000 in workers  compensation insurance recovery receivables and a corresponding increase in its workers  compensation liability. The workers  compensation insurance recovery receivable is included in our prepaid expenses and other current assets on the balance sheet.  Income Taxes  We account for income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes.  The objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Deferred taxes, resulting from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities, are also adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. ASC Topic 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. ASC Topic 740, also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, ASC Topic 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions.  New Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue for which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. In July 2015, the FASB agreed to defer the effective date of the standard from January1, 2017, to January1, 2018, with an option that permits companies to adopt the standard as early as the original effective date. Early application prior to the original effective date is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December15, 2015.  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which will explicitly require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. Currently, there is no guidance in GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this update provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1)provide a definition of the term  substantial doubt , (2)require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3)provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4)require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5)require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and (6)require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this update are effective for the first annual period ending after December15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this update on its financial statements.    23
