Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation and Description of Business  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Addus HomeCare Corporation ( Holdings ) and its subsidiaries (together with Holdings, the  Company  or  we ). The Company operates as one reportable business segment and is a provider of comprehensive personal care services, which are provided principally in the home. The Company s personal care services provide assistance with activities of daily living. The Company s consumers are primarily persons who are at risk of hospitalization or institutionalization, such as the elderly, chronically ill and disabled. The Company s payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. As of March31, 2017, the Company provided personal care services to over 34,000 consumers through 111 locations across 24 states.  Principles of Consolidation  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company s investment in entities with less than 20% ownership or in which the Company does not have the ability to influence the operations of the investee are accounted for using the cost method and are included in investments in joint ventures.  Revenue Recognition  The Company generates net service revenues by providing services directly to consumers. The Company receives payments for providing services from federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers. The Company s operations are principally provided based on authorized hours, determined by the relevant agency, at an hourly rate specified in agreements or fixed by legislation and recognized as revenues at the time services are rendered. Personal care service revenues are reimbursed by state, local and other governmental programs which are partially funded by Medicaid or Medicaid waiver programs, with the remainder reimbursed through insurance programs and private pay.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  The Company establishes its allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected. The Company establishes its provision for doubtful accounts primarily by analyzing historical trends and the aging of receivables. In its evaluation, the Company considers other factors including: delays in payment trends in individual states due to budget or funding issues; billing conversions related to acquisitions or internal systems; resubmission of bills with required documentation and disputes with specific payors. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that the Company s management believes is sufficient to cover potential losses. However, actual collections could differ from the Company s estimates.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets by use of the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful lives of the property and equipment are as follows:       Goodwill  The Company s carrying value of goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired from various acquisitions including the acquisition of Addus HealthCare, Inc. ( Addus HealthCare ). In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 350,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur, such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. The Company may use a qualitative test, known as  Step 0,  or a two-step quantitative method to determine whether impairment has occurred. In Step 0, the Company can elect to perform an optional qualitative analysis and based on the results skip the two step analysis. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company elected to implement Step 0 and was not required to conduct the remaining two step analysis. The results of the Company s Step 0 assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore the Company concluded that there were no impairments for the year ended December31, 2016. No impairment charges were recorded for the three months ended March31, 2017 or 2016.  Intangible Assets  The Company s identifiable intangible assets consist of customer and referral relationships, trade names, trademarks, state licenses and non-compete agreements. Amortization is computed using straight-line and accelerated methods based upon the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which range from two to twenty-fiveyears.  Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the estimated economic benefit method over the useful life and assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company would recognize an impairment loss when the estimated future non-discounted cash flows associated with the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. An impairment charge would then be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of these intangible assets using the income approach. No impairment charge was recorded for the three months ended March31, 2017 or 2016.  The income approach, which the Company uses to estimate the fair value of its intangible assets (other than goodwill), is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, expected periods the assets will be utilized, appropriate discount rates and other variables. The Company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions the Company believes to be reasonable but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.    7     The Company also has indefinite-lived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization expense such as certificates of need and licenses to conduct specific operations within geographic markets. The Company s management has concluded that certificates of need and licenses have indefinite lives, as management has determined that there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, economic or other factors that would limit the useful life of these intangible assets, and the Company intends to renew and operate the certificates of need and licenses indefinitely. The certificates of need and licenses are tested annually for impairment. No impairment was recorded for the three months ended March31, 2017 or 2016.  Debt Issuance Costs  The Company amortizes debt issuance costs on a straight-line method over the term of the related debt. This method approximates the effective interest method. The Company has classified the debt issuance costs as current portion of long-term debt or long term debt, less current portion as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016.  Workers  Compensation Program  The Company s workers  compensation program has a $0.4million deductible component. The Company recognizes its obligations associated with this program in the period the claim is incurred. The cost of both the claims reported and claims incurred but not reported, up to the deductible, have been accrued based on historical claims experience, industry statistics and an actuarial analysis performed by an independent third party. The future claims payments related to the workers  compensation program are secured by letters of credit.  Interest Income  Illinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of income as interest income. For the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not receive any prompt payment interest. While the Company may be owed additional prompt payment interest, the amount and timing of receipt of such payments remains uncertain, and the Company has determined that it will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income when received.  Interest Expense  The Company s interest expense consists of interest and unused credit line fees on its credit facility, capital lease obligations and amortization of debt issuance costs and is reported in the statement of income when incurred.  Other Income  Other income consists of income distributions received from the investment in joint venture. The Company accounts for this income in accordance with ASC Topic 325,  Investments Other.  The Company recognizes the net accumulated earnings only to the extent distributed by the joint venture on the date received.  Income Tax Expense  The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  The objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements or tax returns. Deferred taxes, resulting from differences between the financial and tax basis of the Company s assets and liabilities, are also adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. ASC Topic 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. ASC Topic 740, also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, ASC Topic 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions.  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  ASU 2016-09 allows for simplification of several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under ASU 2016-09, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. ASU 2016-09 also requires recognition of excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. ASU 2016-09 further permits the withholding of an amount up to employees  maximum individual tax rate in the relevant jurisdiction without resulting in a liability classification. ASU 2016-09 also requires any excess tax benefits be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity and cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes to be classified as a financing activity. The Company adopted this standard on January1, 2017 on a prospective basis. As a result, for the three months ended March31, 2017, the Company recorded an excess tax benefit of $26.3 thousand within income tax expense on its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  Stock-based Compensation  The Company currently has one active stock incentive plan, the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the  2009 Plan ), that provides for stock-based employee compensation. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718,  Stock Compensation.  Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis under the 2009 Plan over the vesting period of the equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the options and restricted stock awards. From October28, 2009 to December31, 2016, the Company utilized the Enhanced Hull-White Trinomial Model to value the Company s options. Beginning January1, 2017, the Company began utilizing the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to value the Company s options, as the Company believes it is a more widely accepted and understood valuation model. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payments utilizing the Black-Scholes Model and the Enhanced Hull-White Trinomial Model is affected by the Company s stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected dividends yield, expected forfeiture rate, expected turn-over rate and the expected exercise multiple.  Diluted Net Income Per Common Share  Diluted net income per common share, calculated on the treasury stock method, is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The Company s outstanding securities that may potentially dilute the common stock are stock options and restricted stock awards.  Included in the Company s calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March31, 2017 were approximately 470,000 stock options outstanding, of which approximately 96,000 were dilutive. In addition, there were approximately 143,000 restricted stock awards outstanding, 50,000 of which were dilutive for the three months ended March31, 2017.  Included in the Company s calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March31, 2016 were approximately 758,000 stock options outstanding, of which approximately 131,000 were dilutive. In addition, there were approximately 102,000 restricted stock awards outstanding, 24,000 of which were dilutive for the three months ended March31, 2016.  Estimates  The financial statements are prepared by management in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) and include estimated amounts and certain disclosures based on assumptions about future events. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Company s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, payables and debt. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the Company s long-term debt with variable interest rates approximates fair value based on instruments with similar terms.  The Company applies fair value techniques on a non-recurring basis associated with valuing potential impairment losses related to goodwill and indefinite-lived    8     intangible assets and also when determining the fair value of contingent considerations. To determine the fair value in these situations, the Company uses Level3 inputs, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists; therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as discounted cash flows, or if available, what a market participant would pay on the measurement date.  The Company utilizes the income approach to estimate the fair value of its intangible assets derived from acquisitions. At the date of acquisition, a contingent earn-out obligation is recorded at its fair value, which is calculated as the present value of the Company s maximum obligation based on probability-weighted estimates of achievement of performance targets defined in the earn-out agreements. The Company reviews the fair valuation periodically and adjusts the fair value for any changes in the maximum earn-out obligation based on probability-weighted estimates of achievement of certain performance targets defined in the earn-out agreements. In addition, discounted cash flows were used to estimate the fair value of the Company s investment in joint ventures  Going Concern  In connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the three months ended March31, 2017, the Company conducted an evaluation as to whether there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, which raised substantial doubt as to the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the issuance, or the date of availability, of the financial statements to be issued. The evaluation concluded that there did not appear to be evidence of substantial doubt of the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  New Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP and will be effective for the Company as of January1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition method and we have not yet selected which transition method we will apply. The Company s evaluation of ASU 2014-09 is not complete. The FASB has issued and may issue in the future, interpretative guidance, which may cause the Company s evaluation to change. The Company has completed an initial review to determine the impact ASU 2014-09 and its subsequent updates through December31, 2016 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements or financial statement disclosures upon adoption. Based on the Company s preliminary review, it believes that the timing and measurement of revenue for its customers will be similar to its current revenue recognition. However, this view is preliminary and could change based on the detailed analysis associated with the conversion and implementation phases of the Company s ASU 2014-09 project. The Company will complete its assessment during 2017.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.2016-02,  Leases  which replaces existing leasing rules with a comprehensive lease measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-02 will require lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as liabilities, with corresponding  right- of-use  assets and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2018, subject to early adoption. For income statement recognition purposes, leases will be classified as either a finance or an operating lease. The Company will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Upon initial evaluation, the Company believes that the new standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets but it will not affect our liquidity. The Company is continuing to evaluate other potential impacts to its financial statements and accounting systems including whether the Company will need to secure new software to account for the change in accounting for leases.  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.2016-13,  Financial Instruments (Topic 326) Credit Losses.  ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Under the new standard, entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income are to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. An allowance for credit losses will be a valuation account that will be deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. ASU 2016-13 is effective asof January1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13.  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  This standardamends and adjusts how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless impracticable. If impracticable the Company would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date possible. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-15 will have on its statement of financial position or financial statement disclosures.   In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,  Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.  The new guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value (i.e., measure the charge based on the current Step 1). ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual and any interim impairment tests for periods beginning after December15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2017-04 to determine how its goodwill impairment testing will be impacted and whether it may elect to adopt ASU 2017-04 prior to the stated effective date.  2. Sale of Adult Day Services Centers  In order to focus on providing services to consumers in their homes, effective March1, 2017, the Company ceased the adult day services business and completed its sale of substantially all of the assets used in three adult day services centers in Illinois. The Company received proceeds of approximately $2.4million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.1million on the sale of the three adult day services centers.  3. Acquisitions  Effective February23, 2016, the Company acquired certain assets of Lutheran Social Services of Illinois ( LSSI ) for approximately $0.1million. The results of operations from the acquisition of LSSI are included in the Company s statement of income from the date of the acquisition. The LSSI acquisition accounted for $0.2million and $0.1million of net service revenues and $7.5 thousand and $3.7 thousand of net income for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In order to focus on providing services to consumers in their homes, effective March1, 2017, Addus ceased providing adult day services and sold substantially all of the assets used in our adult day services centers, including LSSI.  On April24, 2015, Addus HealthCare entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Margaret Coffey and Carol Kolar (the  South Shore Sellers ), South Shore Home Health Service Inc. ( South Shore ) and Acaring Home Care, LLC ( Acaring ), pursuant to which Addus HealthCare agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of each of South Shore and Acaring. On February5, 2016, Addus HealthCare completed its acquisition of all the outstanding securities of South Shore and Acaring for a total purchase price of $20.0million (the  South Shore Purchase Price ). The related acquisition costs, included in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income, were $1.3million and were expensed as incurred. The results of operations from South Shore and Acaring are included in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of the acquisition. Acaring was dissolved on March1, 2016, and its assets were transferred to South Shore.    9     The Company s acquisition of South Shore and Acaring has been accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations,   and the resulting goodwill and other intangible assets was accounted for under ASC Topic 350  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.  The acquisition was recorded at its fair value as of February5, 2016. Under business combination accounting, the South Shore Purchase Price was $20.0million and was allocated to South Shore s net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. Based upon management s valuation, the total purchase price has been allocated as follows:      Management s assessment of qualitative factors affecting goodwill for South Shore includes: estimates of market share at the date of purchase; ability to grow in the market; synergy with existing Company operations and the presence of managed care payors in the market.  Identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of trade names and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements. The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets was determined by the Company s management. The net intangible and identifiable intangible assets, including goodwill, are deductible for tax purposes.  The South Shore acquisition accounted for $14.3million and $8.2million of net service revenues and $1.0million and $0.3million of net income for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The following table contains unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated income statement information assuming the South Shore and Acaring acquisition closed on January1, 2015.      The pro forma disclosures in the table above include adjustments for amortization of intangible assets and tax expense and acquisition costs to reflect results that are more representative of the combined results of the transactions as if South Shore and Acaring had been acquired effective January1, 2015. This pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be indicative of the results of operations that would have actually occurred. In addition, future results may vary significantly from the results reflected in the pro forma information. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect the impact of future events that may occur after the acquisition, such as anticipated cost savings from operating synergies.  4. Goodwill and Intangible Assets  A summary of the goodwill activity for the three months ended March31, 2017 is provided below:        10     The carrying amount and accumulated amortization of each identifiable intangible asset category consisted of the following as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016:      Amortization expense related to the identifiable intangible assets amounted to $1.0million for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016. Goodwill and state licenses are not amortized pursuant to ASC Topic 350.  5. Details of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts  Prepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following:      Accrued expenses consisted of the following:           (1)  The Company provides health insurance coverage to qualified union employees providing personal care services in Illinois through a Taft-Hartley multi-employer health and welfare plan under Section302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. The Company s insurance contributions equal the amount reimbursed by the State of Illinois. Contributions are due within five business days from the date the funds are received from the State. Amounts due of $0.3million and $2.2million for health insurance reimbursements and contributions were reflected in prepaid insurance and accrued insurance as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016, respectively.    11       (2)  As a condition of the sale of substantially all of the assets used in the Company s home health business to subsidiaries of LHC Group, Inc. ( LHCG ) in February 2013, the Company is responsible for any adjustments to Medicare and Medicaid billings prior to the closing. In connection with an internal evaluation of the Company s billing processes, the Company discovered documentation errors in a number of claims that it had submitted to Medicare. Consistent with applicable law, the Company voluntarily remitted $1.8million to the U.S. government in March 2014. As of March 31, 2017, the Company, using its best judgment, has estimated a total of $0.4million for billing adjustments for 2013, 2012 and 2011 services which may be subject to Medicare audits. For the years ended December31, 2016 and 2015, the Company reduced the indemnification reserve accrual by the amounts accrued for periods no longer subject to Medicare audits of $0.2million and $0.4million, respectively. This amount is reflected as a reduction in general and administrative expense of discontinued operations.    (3)  Accrued severance represents amounts payable to terminated employees with employment and/or separation agreements with the Company.    (4)  Accrued restructuring includes reserves for lease commitments related to the closure of three adult day services centers in Illinois during the third quarter of 2016 and unused contact center office space.  6. Long-Term Debt  Long-term debt consisted of the following:      In accordance with ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  the Company has classified the debt issuance costs as current portion of long-term debt or long term debt, less current portion as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016.  Capital Leases  On July12, 2014, September11, 2014 and April13, 2015, the Company executed three 48-month capital lease agreements for $2.7million, $1.4million and $0.4million, respectively, with First American Commercial Bancorp, Inc. The capital leases were entered into to finance property and equipment at the Company s support center. The underlying assets are included in  Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These capital lease obligations require monthly payments through September2019and have implicit interest rates that range from 3.0% to 3.6%. At the end of the term of each lease agreement, the Company has the option to purchase the assets covered by such lease agreement for $1.  Effective October1, 2016, the Company entered into a 25-month capital lease agreement for $0.6million with Meridian Leasing Corporation. The capital leases were entered into to finance property and equipment for the Company s telephone systems. The underlying assets are included in  Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. These capital lease obligations require monthly payments through October 2018and have an implicit interest rate of 11.1%. At the end of the term, the Company has the option to purchase the assets for $1 per the lease agreement.  The following is an analysis of the leased property under capital leases by major classes.        12     The future minimum payments for capital leases as of March31, 2017 are as follows:           (1)  Amount necessary to reduce net minimum lease payments to present value calculated at the Company s incremental borrowing rate at lease inception.    (2)  Included in the balance sheet as $1.5million of the current portion of long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs and $0.6million of the long-term debt, less current portion, net of debt issuance costs.  Senior Secured Credit Facility  On May24, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to its credit facility with certain lenders and Fifth Third Bank, as agent and letters of credit issuer. The Company s amended credit facility provides a $100.0million revolving line of credit, a delayed draw term loan facility of up to $25.0million and an uncommitted incremental term loan facility of up to $50.0million, expiring November10, 2020 and includes a $35.0million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The amended credit facility increased the specified advance multiple from 3.25 to 3.75 to 1.00 and the maximum permitted senior leverage ratio from 3.50 to 4.00 to 1.00. Except as modified by the May24, 2016 amendment, the amended credit facility contains the same material terms as the previous agreement dated November10, 2015. Substantially all of the subsidiaries of Holdings are co-borrowers, and Holdings has guaranteed the borrowers  obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in all of Holdings  and the borrowers  current and future tangible and intangible assets, including the shares of stock of the borrowers.  The availability of funds under the revolving credit portion of the Company s credit facility, is based on the lesser of (i)the product of adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, for the most recent 12-month period for which financial statements have been delivered under the credit agreement multiplied by the specified advance multiple, up to 3.75, less the outstanding senior indebtedness and letters of credit, and (ii)$100.0million less the outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit. Interest on our credit facility may be payable at (x)the sum of (i)an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50% based on the applicable leverage ratio plus (ii)a base rate equal to the greatest of (a)the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the  prime rate,  (b)the sum of the federal funds rate plus a margin of 0.50% and (c)the sum of the adjusted LIBOR that would be applicable to a loan with an interest period of one month advanced on the applicable day plus a margin of 3.00% or (y)the sum of (i)an applicable margin ranging from 3.00% to 3.50% based on the applicable leverage ratio plus (ii)the adjusted LIBOR that would be applicable to a loan with an interest period of one, two or three months advanced on the applicable day or (z)the sum of (i)an applicable margin ranging from 3.00% to 3.50% based on the applicable leverage ratio plus (ii)the daily floating LIBOR that would be applicable to a loan with an interest period of one month advanced on the applicable day. The Company pays a fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.50%per annum based on the applicable leverage ratio times the unused portion of the revolving portion of the credit facility. Issued stand-by letters of credit are charged at a rate equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR loans payable quarterly. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company drew and subsequently repaid $20.0 million of its revolving credit line to fund on-going operations.As of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016, the Company had a total of $23.8million and $24.1million outstanding on the credit facility and the total availability under the revolving credit loan facility was $82.8million and $79.7million, respectively.  The credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants regarding, among other things, the maintenance of records, compliance with laws, maintenance of permits, maintenance of insurance and property and payment of taxes. The credit facility also contains certain customary financial covenants and negative covenants that, among other things, include a requirement to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a requirement to stay below a maximum senior leverage ratio and a requirement to stay below a maximum permitted amount of capital expenditures, as well as restrictions on guarantees, indebtedness, liens, distributions, investments and loans, subject to customary carve outs, a restriction on dividends (unless no default then exists or would occur as a result thereof, the Company is in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility after giving effect thereto, the Company has an excess availability of at least 40% of the revolving credit commitment under the credit facility and the aggregate amount of dividends and distributions paid in any fiscal year does not exceed $5.0 million), restrictions on the Company s ability to enter into transactions other than in the ordinary course of business, a restriction on the ability to consummate more than three acquisitions in any calendar year, consummate any individual acquisition with a purchase price in excess of $25.0million and consummate acquisitions with total purchase price in excess of $40.0million in the aggregate over the term of the credit facility, in each case without the consent of the lenders, restrictions on mergers, transfers of assets, acquisitions, equipment, subsidiaries and affiliate transactions, subject to customary carve outs, and restrictions on fundamental changes and lines of business.    13     7. Income Taxes  A reconciliation of the statutory federal tax rate of 35.0% for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows:      8. Commitments and Contingencies  Legal Proceedings  From time to time, the Company is subject to legal and/or administrative proceedings incidental to its business. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of pending legal and/or administrative proceedings will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position and results of operations.  On January20, 2016, the Company was served with a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the Company and Cigna Corporation by Stop Illinois Marketing Fraud, LLC, a qui tam relator formed for the purpose of bringing this action. In the action, the plaintiff alleges, inter alia, violations of the federal False Claims Act relating primarily to allegations of violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and allegedly improper referrals of patients from our home care division to our home health business, substantially all of which was sold in 2013. The plaintiff seeks to recover damages, fees and costs under the federal False Claims Act including treble damages, civil penalties and its attorneys  fees. The U.S. government has declined to intervene at this time. Plaintiff amended its complaint on April4, 2016 to include additional allegations in support of its False Claims Act claims, including alleged violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The Company and Cigna Corporation filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on June6, 2016. On February3, 2017, the Court granted Cigna Corporation s motion to dismiss in full, and granted our motion to dismiss in part allowing Plaintiff another chance to amend its complaint. Plaintiff timely filed a second amended complaint on March10, 2017, withdrawing its conspiracy claim under the Federal False Claims Act and adding an explicit claim under the Illinois False Claims Act for the same underlying kickback allegations. On April10, 2017, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint, which has not yet been ruled on by the court. The Company intends to defend the litigation vigorously and believes the case will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.  On May4, 2016, the Company, together with 59 other social service and healthcare providers in the State of Illinois, filed an action in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against certain individuals in their official capacities as agents of the Illinois Department of Human Services, the Illinois Department on Aging, the Illinois Department of Public Health, the Illinois Department of HealthCare and Family Services, the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, the Illinois Department of Corrections and the Illinois Department of Central Management Services, including the Governor of Illinois. On July20, 2016, a third amended complaint was filed by the plaintiffs, who now comprise 97 similarly situated providers and provider organizations. In the action, the plaintiffs, including the Company, allege to have entered into contracts with the various defendants based in part on the Governor s proposed budget, which provided for funding for the services to be provided by plaintiffs thereunder. The Governor subsequently vetoed all of the relevant appropriations bills on June25, 2015 and again vetoed an appropriations bill that included funding for the contracts on June10, 2016. While the defendant officer and agency heads have continued to enforce such contracts, since August1, 2016, the Company received an aggregate of approximately $65.4million in payments from the State of Illinois from the stopgap budget enacted on June30, 2016. In those actions, plaintiffs alleged the defendant officers and agency heads acted beyond the scope of their legal authority in entering into and enforcing contracts with no intent to perform under such contracts by failing to pay amounts due thereunder when due. The action also alleged that the Governor of Illinois  vetoes of appropriations for such contracts violated the Illinois Constitution. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to payment of overdue bills to prevent irreparable harm, including imperiling the State s infrastructure for delivery of human services. On August31, 2016, the Court denied plaintiffs  petitions for declaratory and injunctive relief and dismissed the actions with prejudice. Plaintiffs timely filed a notice of appeal on September30, 2016.  Employment Agreements  The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain members of senior management. The terms of these agreements are up to four years with auto-renewal provisions thereafter, and include non-compete and nondisclosure provisions, as well as provide for defined severance payments in the event of termination.  A substantial percentage of the Company s workforce is represented by the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ). The Company has a national agreement with the SEIU which is currently under negotiation, as well as numerous agreements with local SEIU affiliates which are renegotiated from time to time. These negotiations are often initiated when the Company receives increases in hourly rates from various state agencies. Upon expiration of these collective bargaining agreements, the Company may not be able to negotiate labor agreements on satisfactory terms with these labor unions.  9. Severance and Restructuring  In 2016, the Company initiated steps to streamline its operations. The Company incurred total expenses related to these initiatives of approximately $0.9 million and $3.5 million for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which is included in general and administrative expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company expects some additional restructuring and other costs to occur, however, the amount and timing cannot be determined at this time. The expenses recorded for the three months ended March31, 2017 included costs related to terminated employees. The expenses recorded for the three months ended March31, 2016 included costs related to terminated employees and other direct costs associated with implementing these initiatives. Other direct costs included contract termination costs, accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs.    14     The following provides the components of and changes in our severance and restructuring accruals:      Employee termination costs represent accrued severance payable to terminated employees with employment and/or separation agreements with the Company. The terminations resulted mainly from changes made to the executive leadership team made during the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016.  No restructuring and other costs were recorded for the three months ended March31, 2017. Restructuring and other costs comprised of fees for the termination of an employee incentive program and various contracts with outside vendors for the three months ended March31, 2016.  The aforementioned accruals are included in Accrued Expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the aforementioned expenses are included in General and Administrative Expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  10. Significant Payors  A substantial portion of the Company s net service revenues and accounts receivable are derived from services performed for federal, state and local governmental agencies. The Illinois Department on Aging accounted for 36.5% and 44.8% of the Company s net service revenues for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The related receivables due from the Illinois Department on Aging represented 52.9% and 55.4% of the Company s accounts receivable at March31, 2017 and December31, 2016, respectively.  The State of Illinois  payments have been delayed in the past and may continue to be delayed due to a budget impasse that began in 2015. The State of Illinois did not adopt a comprehensive budget for fiscal year 2016, which ended on June 30, 2016, and it has not yet adopted a comprehensive budget for fiscal year 2017, which began on July 1, 2016. Stopgap budget legislation was enacted on June 30, 2016, which appropriated funds through December 31, 2016. Without a budget, the State is not authorized to pay for the non-Medicaid consumers we serve. During the second half of 2016 and the first three months of 2017, we have been experiencing a delay in payments from the State of Illinois due to the current budget situation. Accounts receivable attributable to delayed payments from the Illinois Department on Aging totaled $58.8 million as of March 31, 2017, approximately $56.2 million thereof related to Non-Medicaid consumers and approximately $2.6 million related to Medicaid consumers. Reimbursements from the State of Illinois could be further delayed due to the lack of a budget for fiscal year 2017 and because current forecasts indicate higher state deficits in the near future.  11. Concentration of Cash  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company maintains cash with financial institutions which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash.  12. Subsequent Events  On April 24, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement to acquire Options Services, Inc. d/b/a Options Home Care ( Options Home Care ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of HB Management Group, Inc., for approximately $23.2 million. Options Home Care is a provider of personal care services in more than 20 counties in New Mexico and the acquisition will expand the footprint of the Company s existing operations in the state. The Company is expected to close on the acquisition in the third quarter, pending customary closing conditions.  On May8, 2017, the Company entered into a new credit facility and credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with certain lenders and Capital One, National Association, as a lender and swing lender and as agent for all lenders. This credit facility totals $250.0 million, replaces our previous senior secured credit facility totaling $125.0 million, and terminates our Second Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of August 11, 2014 with certain lenders and Fifth Third Bank as agent.The new credit facility includes a $125.0 million revolving loan, a $45.0 million term loan and an $80.0 million delayed draw term loan. The maturity of the new credit facility is five years, although the delayed draw term loan is only available until November 8, 2018. Under the terms of an accordion feature of the Credit Agreement, $100.0 million is also available for incremental term loans. Fundings under the delayed draw term loans and the incremental term loans are limited to financing or refinancing Permitted Acquisitions (as defined in the Credit Agreement).  Addus HealthCare is the borrower, with the Company and substantially all of the subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors under the credit facility. The credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in all of the Company s and the other credit parties  current and future tangible and intangible assets, including the shares of stock of the borrower and subsidiaries.  The availability of additional draws under the revolving credit portion of the Company s credit facility is conditioned, among other things, upon (after giving effect to such draws), the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement), less subordinated indebtedness, to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not exceeding 4.25:1.00.  Interest on the Company s credit facility may be payable at (x)the sum of (i)an applicable margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% based on the applicable senior leverage ratio (provided that the applicable margin will be 1.50% through approximately October 31, 2017) plus (ii)a base rate equal to the greatest of (a)the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the  prime rate,  (b)the sum of the federal funds rate plus a margin of 0.50% and (c)the sum of the adjusted LIBOR that would be applicable to a loan with an interest period of one month advanced on the applicable day (not to be less than 0.00%) plus a margin of 1.00% or (y)the sum of (i)an applicable margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.25% based on the applicable leverage ratio (provided that the applicable margin will be 2.50% through approximately October 31, 2017) plus (ii) the offered rate per annum for the applicable interest period that appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page. Swing loans may not be LIBOR loans.  We pay a fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.50%based on the applicable leverage ratio times the unused portion of the revolving portion of the credit facility. (provided that the fee will be 0.25% through approximately October 31, 2017).  The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants regarding, among other things, the maintenance of records, compliance with laws, maintenance of permits, maintenance of insurance and property and payment of taxes.  The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary financial covenants and negative covenants that, among other things, include a requirement to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a requirement to stay below a maximum senior leverage ratio and a requirement to stay below a maximum permitted amount of capital expenditures, as well as restrictions on guarantees, indebtedness, liens, investments and loans, subject to customary carve outs, a restriction on dividends (provided that Addus Healthcare may make distributions to the Company in an amount that does not exceed $5.0 million in any year absent of an event of default, plus limited exceptions for tax and administrative distributions), a restriction on the ability to consummate acquisitions in amounts exceeding $60.0 million individually and $80.0 million in the aggregate each year (in each case, without the consent of the lenders), restrictions on mergers, dispositions of assets, and affiliate transactions, and restrictions on fundamental changes and lines of business.  The Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties  rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.3.    15       
ITEM2.
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  You should read the following discussion together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations. Statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or that include words like  believes,   belief,   expects,   plans,   anticipates,   intends,   projects,   estimates,   may,   might,   would,   should  and similar expressions are intended to be forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described therein. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December31, 2016, filed on March15, 2017. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on any forward-looking statement as a prediction of future events. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking and we do not intend to release publicly any updates or changes in our expectations concerning the forward-looking statements or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances upon which any forward-looking statement may be based, except as required by law.  Overview  We operate as one business segment and are a provider of comprehensive personal care services, which are provided principally in the home. Our personal care services provide assistance with activities of daily living. Our consumers are primarily persons who are at risk of hospitalization or institutionalization, such as the elderly, chronically ill and disabled. Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. As of March31, 2017, we provided personal care services to over 34,000 consumers through 111 locations across 24 states. For the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, we served approximately 38,000 and 36,000 discrete consumers, respectively.  A summary of our financial results for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 is provided in the table below:      Our services are predominantly provided in the home under agreements with state and local government agencies. Our consumers are predominately  dual eligible,  meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. The federal government permits states to initiate dual eligible demonstration programs and other managed Medicaid initiatives designed to coordinate the services provided through Medicare and Medicaid, with the overall objective of improving care quality and reducing costs. States are increasingly implementing managed care programs to deliver healthcare services to Medicaid enrollees. Managed care organizations have an economic incentive to better manage the healthcare expenditures of their membership, and therefore seek to provide care in a more cost-effective setting, such as a patient s home. Managed care revenues accounted for 32.3% and 23.1% of our revenue mix during the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Our model is designed to improve consumer outcomes and satisfaction, as well as lower the cost of acute care treatment and reduce service duplication. We believe our model to be especially valuable to managed care organizations that have economic responsibility for both personal care services as well as acute care expenditures. We believe our model is a differentiator and as a result we expect to receive increased referrals from managed care organizations.  The personal care services we provide include assistance with bathing, grooming, oral care, assistance with feeding and dressing, medication reminders, meal planning and preparation, housekeeping and transportation services and other activities of daily living. We provide these non-medical services on a long-term, continuous basis, with an average duration of approximately 26 months per consumer.  We utilize home care aides to observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of early intervention in the disease process, with the goal of reducing the cost of medical services by preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions and re-admissions. We coordinate the services provided by our team with those of other healthcare agencies as appropriate. Changes in our consumers  conditions are evaluated by appropriately trained managers and may result in the condition being reported to the consumers  case manager at the managed care organization or other payor and in some cases to the consumers  primary care physicians for treatment or other follow-up. We believe this approach to the care of our consumers and the integration of our services into the broader healthcare continuum are attractive to managed care organizations and other payors who are ultimately responsible for the healthcare needs and costs of our consumers.  We utilize Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) systems and smart phone applications to communicate with the majority of our home care aides. Through these technologies our aides are able to report changes in health conditions with alerts forwarded to an appropriate manager for triage and evaluation.In addition, we use this technology to record basic transaction information about each visit, record start and end times for a scheduled shift, track mileage reimbursement, send text messages to the home care aide and communicate basic payroll information.  In addition to our focus on organic growth, we have been growing through selective acquisitions, which have expanded our presence in current markets or which have facilitated our entry into new markets where the personal care business has been moving to managed care organizations. We completed seven acquisitions during the period from December2013 through February 2016.    16     Business  As of March31, 2017, we provided our personal care services through 111 locations across 24 states.  Our payor clients are principally federal, state and local governmental agencies and, increasingly, managed care organizations. The federal, state and local programs under which the agencies operate are subject to legislative, budgetary and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates. We are experiencing a further transition of business from government payors to managed care organizations with which we are seeking to grow our business given our emphasis on coordinated care and the prevention of the need for acute care. Managed care organizations are commercial insurance carriers that are under contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide and manage a full continuum of care.  For the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 our payor revenue mix was:      We derive a significant amount of our net service revenues from our operations in Illinois, which represented 53.1% and 54.8% of our total net service revenues for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  A significant amount of our net service revenues are derived from one payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 36.5% and 44.8% of our total net service revenues for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The State of Illinois  payments have been delayed in the past and may continue to be delayed due to a budget impasse that began in 2015. The State of Illinois did not adopt a comprehensive budget for fiscal year 2016, which ended on June30, 2016, and it has not yet adopted a comprehensive budget for fiscal year 2017, which began on July1, 2016. Stopgap budget legislation was enacted on June30, 2016, which appropriated funds through December31, 2016. Without a budget, the State is not authorized to pay for the non-Medicaid consumers we serve. During the second half of 2016 and the first three months of 2017, we have been experiencing a delay in payments from the State of Illinois due to the current budget situation. Accounts receivable attributable to delayed payments from the Illinois Department on Aging totaled $58.8 million as of March31, 2017, approximately $56.2 million thereof related to Non-Medicaid consumers and approximately $2.6 million related to Medicaid consumers. Reimbursements from the State of Illinois could be further delayed due to the lack of a budget for fiscal year 2017 and because current forecasts indicate higher state deficits in the near future.  We measure the performance of our business using a number of different metrics, including billable hours, billable hours per business day, revenues per billable hour and the number of consumers, or census.  Components of our Statements of Income  Net Service Revenues  We generate net service revenues by providing our services directly to consumers and primarily on an hourly basis. We receive payment for providing such services from our payor clients, including federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers. Net service revenues are principally provided based on authorized hours, determined by the relevant agency, at an hourly rate which is either contractual or fixed by legislation and are recognized at the time services are rendered.  Cost of Service Revenues  We incur direct care wages, payroll taxes and benefit-related costs in connection with providing our services. We also provide workers  compensation and general liability coverage for our employees.  Employees are also reimbursed for their travel time and related travel costs.  General and Administrative Expenses  Our general and administrative expenses include our costs for operating our network of local agencies and our administrative offices.  Our agency expenses consist of costs for supervisory personnel, our community care supervisors and office administrative costs. Personnel costs include wages, payroll taxes, and employee benefits. Facility costs including rents, utilities, postage, telephone and office expenses. Our support center and executive office includes costs for accounting, information systems, human resources, billing and collections, contracting, marketing and executive leadership. These expenses consist of compensation, including stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, employee benefits, legal, accounting and other professional fees, travel, general insurance, rents and related facility costs.  In 2016, the Company initiated steps to streamline its operations. The Company incurred total expenses related to these initiatives of approximately $0.9million and $3.5million for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which is included in general and administrative expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company expects some additional restructuring and other costs to occur, however, the amount and timing cannot be determined at this time. The expenses recorded for the three months ended March31, 2017 included costs related to terminated employees. The expenses recorded for three months ended March31, 2016 included costs related to terminated employees and other direct costs associated with implementing these initiatives. Other direct costs included contract termination costs, accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs.  Depreciation and Amortization Expenses  We amortize our intangible assets with finite lives, consisting of customer and referral relationships, trade names, trademarks, state licenses and non-compete agreements, principally using accelerated methods based upon their estimated useful lives. Depreciable assets consist principally of furniture and equipment, network administration and telephone equipment, and operating system software. Depreciable and leasehold assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line method over their useful lives or, if less and if applicable, their lease terms.    17     Interest Income  Illinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received. For the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, we did not receive any prompt payment interest.  Interest Expense  Interest expense consists of interest and unused credit line fees on our credit facility, capital lease obligations and other debt instruments and is reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income when incurred.  Other Income  For the three months ended March31, 2017 other income of $0.1million consists of income distributions received from the cost method investment in joint venture. No distributions were received during the three months ended March31, 2016. We account for this income in accordance with ASC Topic 325,  Investments Other.  We recognize the net accumulated earnings only to the extent distributed by the joint venture on the date received.  Income Tax Expense  All of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. Our federal statutory rate was 35.0% for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016. The effective income tax rate was 33.2% and 32.9% for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The difference between federal statutory and effective income tax rates is principally due to the inclusion of state taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits that lower our effective tax rate.  Results of Operations  Three Months Ended March31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March31, 2016  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations.            (1)  Average billable census is the number of unique clients receiving a billable service during a period.    (2)  Billable hours is the total number of hours provided to clients during a period.    18     Net service revenues from federal, state, local and other governmental programs accounted for 64.9% and 73.2% of net service revenues for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Managed care organizations accounted for 32.3% and 23.1% of net service revenues for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with commercial insurance payors and private pay accounting for the remainder of net service revenues.A significant amount of our net service revenues for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 were derived from one payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 36.5% and 44.8% respectively, of our total net service revenues.  Net service revenues increased $9.0million, or 9.7%, to $101.6million for the three months ended March31, 2017 compared to $92.6million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a 8.4% increase in billable hours and a 1.3% increase in revenues per billable hour.  Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, increased to 26.9% for the first quarter of 2017, compared to 26.3% for the same period in 2016. This increase is primarily due to a $0.5 million reduction in travel wages, travel mileage and unbillable errand mileage in the three months ended March31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended March31, 2016,  General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to 20.6% for the three months ended March31, 2017, from 24.0% for the three months ended March31, 2016. General and administrative expenses decreased to $20.9million as compared to $22.2million for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $2.6million decrease in severance and restructuring costs related to our initiatives to streamline operations which began in 2016.  Depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent from the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 at $1.5million. Amortization of intangibles, which are principally amortized using accelerated methods, totaled $1.0million for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016.  Interest Income  Illinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received. For the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, we did not receive any prompt payment interest.  Interest Expense  Interest expense increased to $0.7million from $0.4million for the three months ended March31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily the result of interest on the term loan portion of the senior secured credit facility outstanding during each period. See Note 6 to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Long-Term Debt for additional information.  Other Income  For the three months ended March31, 2017, other income of $0.1million consists of income distributions received from the cost method investment in joint venture. No distributions were received during the three months ended March31, 2016. We account for this income in accordance with ASC Topic 325,  Investments Other.  We recognize the net accumulated earnings only to the extent distributed by the joint venture on the date received.  Income Tax Expense  All of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. For the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 our federal statutory rate was 35.0%. The effective income tax rate was 33.2% and 32.9% for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.The difference between our federal statutory and effective income tax rates are principally due to the inclusion of state taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits that lower our effective tax rate.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Overview  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility. As described below under New Credit Facility, we entered into a new credit facility on May8, 2017 that replaced our prior credit facility. We entered into an amendment to our prior credit facility on the terms described below on May24, 2016. At March31, 2017 and December31, 2016, we had cash balances of $19.2million and $8.0million, respectively.   As of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 we had a total of $23.8million and $24.1million outstanding on our credit facility, respectively. After giving effect to the amount drawn on our credit facility, approximately $16.7million of outstanding letters of credit as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016, and borrowing limits based on an advance multiple of adjusted EBITDA, we had $82.8million and $79.7million available for borrowing under the credit facility as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016, respectively.  Cash flows from operating activities represent the inflow of cash from our payor clients and the outflow of cash for payroll and payroll taxes, operating expenses, interest and taxes. Due to its revenue deficiencies as well as budgeting and financing issues, from time to time the State of Illinois has reimbursed us on a delayed basis with respect to our various agreements including with our largest payor, the Illinois Department on Aging. The open receivable balance from the State of Illinois decreased by $3.6million from $69.3million as of December31, 2016 to $65.7million as of March31, 2017. The decrease resulted from $40.1million in payments for Medicaid consumers made during the first quarter of 2017 offset by additional billings for services provided during the quarter.  The State of Illinois  payments have been delayed in the past and may continue to be delayed due to a budget impasse that began in 2015. The State of Illinois did not adopt a comprehensive budget for fiscal year 2016, which ended on June30, 2016, and it has not yet adopted a comprehensive budget for fiscal year 2017, which began on July1, 2016. Stopgap budget legislation was enacted on June30, 2016, which appropriated funds through December31, 2016. Without a budget, the State is not authorized to pay for the non-Medicaid consumers we serve. During the second half of 2016 and the first three months of 2017, we have been experiencing a delay in payments from the State of Illinois due to the current budget situation. Accounts receivable attributable to delayed payments from the Illinois Department on Aging totaled $58.8 million as of March31, 2017, approximately $56.2 million thereof related to Non-Medicaid consumers and approximately $2.6 million related to Medicaid consumers. Reimbursements from the State of Illinois could be further delayed due to the lack of a budget for fiscal year 2017 and because current forecasts indicate higher state deficits in the near future.  There remains uncertainty surrounding the remainder of the 2017 fiscal year and future budgets. If payments from the State of Illinois continue to be delayed in the future or become further delayed, or the Illinois State budget impasse is not resolved in the near term, the delays could adversely impact our liquidity and result in the need to increase borrowings under our credit facility or cause us to pursue other liquidity options.  New Credit Facility  On May8, 2017, we entered into a new credit facility and credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with certain lenders and Capital One, National Association, as a lender and swing lender and as agent for all lenders. This credit facility totals $250.0 million, replaces our previous senior secured credit facility totaling $125.0 million, and terminates our Second Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of November 10, 2015 with certain lenders and Fifth Third Bank as agent.The new credit facility includes a $125.0 million revolving loan, a $45.0 million term loan and an $80.0 million delayed draw term loan. The maturity of the new credit facility is five years, although the delayed draw term loan is only available until November8, 2018. Under the terms of an accordion feature of the Credit Agreement, $100.0 million is also available for incremental term loans. The availability of additional draws under the revolving credit portion of our credit facility is conditioned, among other things, upon (after giving effect to such draws), the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement), less subordinated indebtedness, to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not exceeding 4.25:1.00. The applicable margin (in addition to the Base Rate or LIBOR, as defined in the Credit Agreement) for interest payments ranges from 1.50% to 2.25% (for Base Rate Loans) and from 2.50% to 3.25% (for LIBOR Loans) based on the applicable senior leverage ratio (provided that such applicable margin will be 1.50% (for Base Rate Loans) and 2.50% (for LIBOR Loans) through approximately October31, 2017). The terms of the Credit Agreement are described in further detail under Note12 Subsequent Events to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.    19     Credit Facility Prior to May8, 2017  On May24, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility with certain lenders and Fifth Third Bank, as agent and letters of credit issuer. Our amended credit facility provides a $100.0million revolving line of credit, a delayed draw term loan facility of up to $25.0million and an uncommitted incremental term loan facility of up to $50.0million, expiring November10, 2020 and includes a $35.0million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The amended credit facility increased the specified advance multiple from 3.25 to 3.75 to 1.00 and the maximum permitted senior leverage ratio from 3.50 to 4.00 to 1.00. Except as modified by the May24, 2016, amendment, the amended credit facility contains the same material terms as the previous agreement dated November10, 2015. Substantially all of the subsidiaries of Holdings are co-borrowers, and Holdings has guaranteed the borrowers  obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in all of Holdings  and the borrowers  current and future tangible and intangible assets, including the shares of stock of the borrowers.  The availability of funds under the revolving credit portion of our credit facility is based on the lesser of (i)the product of adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, for the most recent 12-month period for which financial statements have been delivered under the credit agreement multiplied by the specified advance multiple, up to 3.75, less the outstanding senior indebtedness and letters of credit, and (ii)$100.0million less the outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit. Interest on our credit facility may be payable at (x)the sum of (i)an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50% based on the applicable leverage ratio plus (ii)a base rate equal to the greatest of (a)the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the  prime rate,  (b)the sum of the federal funds rate plus a margin of 0.50% and (c)the sum of the adjusted LIBOR that would be applicable to a loan with an interest period of one month advanced on the applicable day plus a margin of 3.00% or (y)the sum of (i)an applicable margin ranging from 3.00% to 3.50% based on the applicable leverage ratio plus (ii)the adjusted LIBOR that would be applicable to a loan with an interest period of one, two or three months advanced on the applicable day or (z)the sum of (i)an applicable margin ranging from 3.00% to 3.50% based on the applicable leverage ratio plus (ii)the daily floating LIBOR that would be applicable to a loan with an interest period of one month advanced on the applicable day. We pay a fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.50%per annum based on the applicable leverage ratio times the unused portion of the revolving portion of the credit facility. Issued stand-by letters of credit are charged at a rate equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR loans payable quarterly. During the first quarter, we drew and subsequently repaid $20.0million of our revolving credit line to fund on-going operations. As of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016, we had a total of $23.8million and $24.1million outstanding on our credit facility and the total availability under our credit facility was $82.8 and $79.7million, respectively.  The credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants regarding, among other things, the maintenance of records, compliance with laws, maintenance of permits, maintenance of insurance and property and payment of taxes. The credit facility also contains certain customary financial covenants and negative covenants that, among other things, include a requirement to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a requirement to stay below a maximum senior leverage ratio and a requirement to stay below a maximum permitted amount of capital expenditures, as well as restrictions on guarantees, indebtedness, liens, distributions, investments and loans, subject to customary carve outs, a restriction on dividends (unless no default then exists or would occur as a result thereof, we are in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility after giving effect thereto, we have an excess availability of at least 40% of the revolving credit commitment under the credit facility and the aggregate amount of dividends and distributions paid in any fiscal year does not exceed $5.0 million), restrictions on our ability to enter into transactions other than in the ordinary course of business, a restriction on the ability to consummate more than three acquisitions in any calendar year, consummate any individual acquisition with a purchase price in excess of $25.0million and consummate acquisitions with total purchase price in excess of $40.0million in the aggregate over the term of the credit facility, in each case without the consent of the lenders, restrictions on mergers, transfers of assets, acquisitions, equipment, subsidiaries and affiliate transactions, subject to customary carve outs, and restrictions on fundamental changes and lines of business. As of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our credit facility covenants.  If we do not have sufficient cash resources or availability under our credit facility, or we are otherwise prohibited from making acquisitions under the terms of our credit facility, our growth, including our ability to grow through acquisitions, could be limited unless we obtain additional equity or debt financing or the necessary consents from our lenders under our credit facility. We believe the available borrowings under our credit facility, combined with cash from operations, will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs for at least the next 12months.  Cash Flows  The following table summarizes changes in our cash flows for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016:       Three Months Ended March31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March31, 2016  Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.6million for the three months ended March31, 2017, compared to cash used in operating activities of $6.0million for the same period in 2016. This increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to payments received from the State of Illinois of $40.1million for Medicaid consumers, offset by additional billings for services provided during the quarter.  Net cash provided by investing activities was $1.2million for the three months ended March31, 2017 compared to cash used in investing activities of $20.8million for the three months ended March31, 2016. Our investing activities for the three months ended March31, 2017 were $2.4million in net proceeds from the sale of three adult day services centers and $1.2million in purchases of property and equipment related to new office space and investments in our technology infrastructure. Our investing activities for the three months ended March31, 2016 were $20.4million for the acquisition of South Shore as previously described in Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) and $0.3million in purchases of property and equipment to invest in our technology infrastructure.  Net cash provided by financing activities was $0.3million for the three months ended March31, 2017 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $31.7million for the three months ended March31, 2016. Our financing activities for the three months ended March31, 2017 were $20.0million in draws on the revolver portion of our credit facility to fund growth and on-going operations and the subsequent repayment of $20.0million, $1.0million in cash received from exercise of stock options, $0.4million of payments on capital lease obligations and $0.3million of payments on the term loan portion of our credit facility. Our financing activities for the three months ended March31, 2016 were a $32.0million draw on our credit facility to fund on-going operations and the acquisitions of South Shore, $0.3million of payments on long-term debt, $0.2million payment for debt issuance costs and $0.2million of cash received for the exercise of employee stock options.    20     Outstanding Accounts Receivable  Gross accounts receivable as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 were approximately $124.4million. Outstanding accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, decreased by $0.8million as of March31, 2017 as compared to December31, 2016. The decrease in net accounts receivable is primarily due to a $0.9 million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts for managed care organizations and acquisition transitions.  We establish our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected. We establish our provision for doubtful accounts primarily by analyzing historical trends and the aging of receivables. In our evaluation, we consider other factors including: delays in payment trends in individual states due to budget or funding issues; billing conversions related to acquisitions or internal systems; resubmission of bills with required documentation and disputes with specific payors. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that our management believes is sufficient to cover potential losses. However, actual collections could differ from our estimates.  Our collection procedures include review of account aging and direct contact with our payors. We have historically not used collection agencies. An uncollectible amount is written off to the allowance account after reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted.  The following tables detail our accounts receivable before reserves by payor category, showing Illinois governmental payors separately, and the related allowance amount at March31, 2017 and December31, 2016:      We calculate our days sales outstanding ( DSO ) by taking the accounts receivable outstanding net of the allowance for doubtful accounts divided by the total net service revenues for the last quarter, multiplied by the number of days in that quarter. Our DSOs were 103 days and 104 days at March31, 2017 and December31, 2016, respectively. The DSOs for our largest payor, the Illinois Department on Aging, at March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 were 148 days and 152 days, respectively. We may not receive payments on a consistent basis in the near term and our DSOs and the DSO for the Illinois Department on Aging may increase depending on the actions of the Illinois General Assembly and the Governor related to the fiscal year 2017 budget. The increase in the reserve as a percentage of gross accounts receivable to 6.6% as of March31, 2017 from 5.9% as of December31, 2016 is attributable to additional reserves needed for managed care organizations and acquisition transitions.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of March31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet guarantees or arrangements with unconsolidated entities.    21     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expense and related disclosures. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other sources and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider the items discussed below to be critical because of their impact on operations and their application requires our judgment and estimates.  Revenue Recognition  The majority of our revenues for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 are derived from Medicaid and Medicaid waiver programs under agreements with various state and local authorities. These agreements provide for a service term from one year to an indefinite term. Services are provided based on authorized hours, determined by the relevant state or local agency, at an hourly rate specified in the agreement or fixed by legislation and recognized in net service revenues as services are provided. Services to other payors, such as managed care organizations and commercial insurance or private clients, are provided at negotiated hourly rates and recognized in net service revenues as services are provided. We provide for appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts at the time the services are rendered.  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  We are paid for our services primarily by state and local agencies under Medicaid or Medicaid waiver programs, managed care organizations, commercial insurance companies and private consumers. While our accounts receivable are uncollateralized, our credit risk is somewhat limited due to the significance of governmental payors to our results of operations. Laws and regulations governing the governmental programs in which we participate are complex and subject to interpretation. Amounts collected may be different than amounts billed due to client eligibility issues, insufficient or incomplete documentation, services at levels other than authorized and other reasons unrelated to credit risk.  Illinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the income statement caption, interest income. We did not receive any prompt payment interest for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016.  We establish our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected. We establish our provision for doubtful accounts primarily by analyzing historical trends and the aging of receivables. In our evaluation, we consider other factors including: delays in payment trends in individual states due to budget or funding issues; billing conversions related to acquisitions or internal systems; resubmission of bills with required documentation and disputes with specific payors. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that our management believes is sufficient to cover potential losses. However, actual collections could differ from our estimates.  Goodwill  Our carrying value of goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired from various acquisitions including the acquisition of Addus HealthCare, Inc. ( Addus HealthCare ). In accordance with ASC Topic 350,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur, such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. We may use a qualitative test, known as  Step 0,  or a two-step quantitative method to determine whether impairment has occurred. We can elect to perform Step 0, an optional qualitative analysis, and based on the results skip the remaining two steps. In 2016, we elected to implement Step 0, and we were not required to conduct the remaining two steps. The results of our Step 0 assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore we concluded that there were no impairments for the year ended December31, 2016. No impairment charges were recorded for the three months ended March31, 2017 or 2016.  Long-Lived Assets  We review our long-lived assets and finite lived intangibles for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. To determine if impairment exists, we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the related long-lived assets to the net carrying amount of such assets. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset, generally determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows. No impairment charges were recorded for the year ended December31, 2016 or three months ended March31, 2017 or 2016.  Indefinite-lived Assets  We also have indefinite-lived assets that are not subject to amortization expense such as licenses and in certain states certificates of need to conduct specific operations within geographic markets. Our management has concluded that these assets have indefinite lives, as management has determined that there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, economic or other factors that would limit the useful life of these intangible assets and we intend to renew the licenses indefinitely. The licenses and certificates of need are tested annually for impairment. No impairment charges were recorded for the year ended December31, 2016 or three months ended March31, 2017 or 2016.  Workers  Compensation Program  Our workers  compensation insurance program has a $0.4million deductible component. We recognize our obligations associated with this program in the period the claim is incurred. The cost of both the claims reported and claims incurred but not reported, up to the deductible, have been accrued based on historical claims experience, industry statistics and an actuarial analysis performed by an independent third party. We monitor our claims quarterly and adjust our reserves accordingly. These costs are recorded primarily in the cost of services caption in the condensed consolidated statement of income. Under the agreement pursuant to which we acquired Addus HealthCare, claims under our workers  compensation insurance program that related to December31, 2005 or earlier were the responsibility of the selling shareholders in the acquisition, subject to certain limitations. The responsibility of the selling shareholders for these claims was terminated on December29, 2014. In August 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No 2010-24, Health Care Entities (Topic 954), Presentation of Insurance Claims and Related Insurance Recoveries ( ASU 2010-24 ), which clarifies that companies should not net insurance recoveries against a related claim liability. Additionally, the amount of the claim liability should be determined without consideration of insurance recoveries. As of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016, we recorded $0.6million and $0.7million in workers  compensation insurance recovery receivables and a corresponding increase in workers  compensation liability. The workers  compensation insurance recovery receivable is included in our prepaid expenses and other current assets on the balance sheet.  Interest Income  Illinois law entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time. As the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain, the interest income is recognized when received. For the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, we did not receive any prompt payment interest.    22     Income Taxes  We account for income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  The objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Deferred taxes, resulting from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities, are also adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. ASC Topic 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. ASC Topic 740, also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, ASC Topic 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions.  Stock-based Compensation  The Company currently has one active stock incentive plan, the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the  2009 Plan ), that provides for stock-based employee compensation. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718,  Stock Compensation.  Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis under the 2009 Plan over the vesting period of the equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the options and restricted stock awards. From October28, 2009 to December31, 2016, the Company utilized the Enhanced Hull-White Trinomial Model to value the Company s options. Beginning January1, 2017, the Company began utilizing the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to value the Company s options, as the Company believes it is a more widely accepted and understood valuation model. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payments utilizing the Black-Scholes Model and the Enhanced Hull-White Trinomial Model is affected by the Company s stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected dividends yield, expected forfeiture rate, expected turn-over rate and the expected exercise multiple.  New Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP and will be effective for us as of January1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition method and we have not yet selected which transition method we will apply. Our evaluation of ASU 2014-09 is not complete. The FASB has issued and may issue in the future, interpretative guidance, which may cause our evaluation to change. We have completed an initial review to determine the impact ASU 2014-09 and its subsequent updates through December31, 2016 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements or financial statement disclosures upon adoption. Based on our preliminary review, we believe that the timing and measurement of revenue for our customers will be similar to our current revenue recognition. However, this view is preliminary and could change based on the detailed analysis associated with the conversion and implementation phases of our ASU 2014-09 project. We will complete our assessment during 2017.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.2016-02,  Leases  which replaces existing leasing rules with a comprehensive lease measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-02 will require lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as liabilities, with corresponding  right-of-use  assets and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2018, subject to early adoption. For income statement recognition purposes, leases will be classified as either a finance or an operating lease. We will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Upon initial evaluation, we believe that the new standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets but it will not affect our liquidity. We are continuing to evaluate other potential impacts to our financial statements and accounting systems including whether we will need to secure new software to account for the change in accounting for leases.  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.2016-13,  Financial Instruments (Topic 326) Credit Losses.  ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Under the new standard, entities holding financial assets, including accounts receivables and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income are to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. An allowance for credit losses will be a valuation account that will be deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. ASU 2016-13 is effective as of January1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13.  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  This standardamends and adjusts how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.ASU 2016-15is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless impracticable. If impracticable we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date possible. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-15 will have on our statement of financial position or financial statement disclosures.  In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,  Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.  The new guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value (i.e., measure the charge based on the current Step 1). ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual and any interim impairment tests for periods beginning after December15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2017-04 to determine how our goodwill impairment testing will be impacted and whether we may elect to adopt ASU 2017-04 prior to the stated effective date.
