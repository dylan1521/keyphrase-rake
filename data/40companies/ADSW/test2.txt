Business Operations Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. (formerly ADS Waste Holdings Inc. hereafter referred to as the Company) together with its consolidated subsidiaries, as a consolidated entity, is a nonhazardous solid waste services company providing collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services to customers in the South, Midwest and Eastern regions of the United States, as well as in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The Company is wholly owned by ADS Waste Holdings Corp. (the "Parent"). The Company manages and evaluates its principal operations through three reportable operating segments on a regional basis. Those operating segments are the South, East and Midwest regions which provide collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services. Additional information related to segments can be found in Note 8. Six acquisitions were completed during the six months ended June 30, 2016 for aggregate prices consisting of a cash purchase price of $4.9 and notes payable of $0.3 , subject to net working capital adjustments, which are expected to be completed within approximately one year. Seven acquisitions were completed during the six months ended June 30, 2015 for a cash purchase price of $23.8 and notes payable of $3.3 . The results of operations of each acquisition are included in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations subsequent to the closing date of each acquisition. The Company recorded a reduction to the purchase price of prior year acquisitions during the six months ended June 30, 2016 in the amount of $0.2 . The Company is still reviewing information surrounding intangible assets and current liabilities related to acquisitions completed subsequent to June 30, 2015.  2. Basis of Presentation The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements include its wholly-owned subsidiaries of Advanced Disposal Services South, Inc. and HW Star Holdings Corp. and their respective subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements as of June30, 2016 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. In the opinion of management, these condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which, unless otherwise disclosed, are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the balance sheet, results of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows, and changes in equity for the periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. The financial statements presented herein should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2015 . In conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the Company uses estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that it uses is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In preparing the Company's financial statements, the more subjective areas that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to: accounting for long-lived assets, including recoverability; landfill development costs, final capping, closure and post-closure costs; valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets; liabilities for potential litigation; claims and assessments; liabilities for environmental remediation; stock compensation; accounting for goodwill and intangible asset impairments; deferred taxes; uncertain tax positions; self-insurance reserves; and estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that the Company uses in preparation of its financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), which simplifies the accounting for employee stock-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the timing of the adoption and the potential impact this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which will require lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding lease liability, and lessors to recognize a net lease investment. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures will also be required to increase transparency and comparability among organizations. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, however; the Company does not expect to early adopt the ASU. Lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. While the Company is still assessing the impact of this standard, it does not believe this standard will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance. The new standard requires that a company recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Companies will need to use more judgment and estimates than under the guidance currently in effect, including estimating the amount of variable revenue to recognize over each identified performance obligation. Additional disclosures will be required to help users of financial statements understand the nature, amount and timing of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date. This standard will now become effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter 2018 and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements and has not selected a transition method.  3. Landfill Liabilities Liabilities for final closure and post-closure costs for the year ended December31, 2015 and for the six months ended  June30, 2016 are shown in the table below:    4. Debt The following table summarizes the major components of debt at each balance sheet date and provides the maturities and interest rate ranges of each major category of debt: 10 Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)   All borrowings under the Term Loan B and the Revolver are guaranteed by each of the Company's current and future U.S. subsidiaries (which also guarantee the Senior Notes), subject to certain agreed-upon exemptions. The Company has one non-guarantor foreign subsidiary as disclosed in Note 11. All guarantors are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally liable. The Parent has no independent assets or operations and each subsidiary guarantor is 100% owned by the Company. There are no significant restrictions on the Company or any guarantor to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan.  Revolver and Letter of Credit Facilities As of June30, 2016 , the Company had an aggregate committed capacity of $300.0 , of which $100.0 was available for letters of credit under its credit facilities. The Company's Revolver is its primary source of letter of credit capacity and expires in October 2017. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $11.0 and $32.0 of borrowings outstanding on the Revolver, respectively. As of June30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had an aggregate of approximately $46.0 and $45.9 , respectively, of letters of credit outstanding under its credit facilities.  5. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The following table summarizes the fair values of derivative instruments recorded in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets:  The Company has not offset fair value of assets and liabilities recognized for its derivative instruments. 11  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)   Interest Rate Caps In December 2012, the Company entered into four interest rate cap agreements to hedge the risk of a rise in interest rates and associated cash flows on its variable rate debt. The Company recorded a premium of $5.0 in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and amortized the premium to interest expense based upon decreases in time value of the caps. Amortization expense was approximately $0.0 and $0.4 for the three months ending June30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.2 and $1.0 , respectively. The notional amounts of the aggregated contracts were approximately $666.6 as of June30, 2016 and expire in tranches through September 2016 . In May 2016, the Company entered into three interest rate cap agreements as economic hedges against the risk of a rise in interest rates and the associated cash flows on its variable rate debt. The Company will pay the $5.5 premium of the caps equally over eleven quarters beginning on March 31, 2017. The Company elected not to apply hedge accounting to these interest rate caps therefore changes in the fair value of the interest rate caps are recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded losses of $2.8 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. The notional value of the contracts aggregated were $800 as of June 30, 2016 and will remain constant through maturity in September 2019. Commodity Futures Contracts The Company utilizes fuel derivative instruments (commodity futures contracts) as economic hedges of the risk that fuel prices will fluctuate. The Company has used financial derivative instruments for both short-term and long-term time frames and utilizes fixed price swap agreements to manage the identified risk. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Changes in the fair value and settlements of the fuel derivative instruments are recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and were income of $2.1 and $4.8 for the three months ended June30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1.5 and ($0.2) , respectively. As of June30, 2016 , the Company has 6.7 gallons under fixed price derivative contracts with strike prices ranging from $2.20 to $2.64 per gallon. If the mean price of the high and the low exceeds the contract price per gallon, the Company receives the difference between the average price and the contract price (multiplied by the notional gallons) from the counterparty. If the mean average price is less than the contract price per gallon, the Company pays the difference to the counterparty.  6. Income Taxes The Company's effective income tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was 90.5% and 38.4% , respectively. The Company evaluates its effective income tax rate at each interim period and adjust it accordingly as facts and circumstances warrant. The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of permanently non-deductible expenses included in stock based compensation. These items had a greater impact on the Company's effective income tax rate during the three months ended June 30, 2016 than in comparable prior periods due to the Company's pre-tax earnings being near break-even for the three month period ending June 30, 2016. The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was primarily due to the mix of income in the states in which the Company operates. The Company's effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was 26.6% and 32.0% , respectively. The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of permanently non-deductible expenses and the unfavorable impact of a change in recorded valuation allowance. The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of a change in recorded valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2016, the Company has $10.0 of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. These liabilities are primarily included as a component of long-term "Other liabilities" in the condensed consolidated balance sheet because the Company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate when it would make any cash payments to settle these liabilities, but it does not believe that the ultimate settlement of the obligations will materially affect its liquidity.   12  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)   7. Commitments and Contingencies Financial Instruments The Company has obtained letters of credit, performance bonds and insurance policies for the performance of landfill final capping, closure and post-closure requirements, environmental remediation, and other obligations. Letters of credit are supported by the Company's Revolver (Note 4). The Company does not expect that any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company has not experienced any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining the required financial assurance instruments for its current operations. In an ongoing effort to mitigate risks of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity, the Company continues to evaluate various options to access cost-effective sources of financial assurance. Insurance The Company carries insurance coverage for protection of its assets and operations from certain risks including automobile liability, general liability, real and personal property, workers compensation, directors and officers liability, pollution, legal liability and other coverages the Company believes are customary to the industry. The Company's exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident deductible, or self-insured retention, under the related insurance policy. Its exposure, however, could increase if its insurers are unable to meet their commitments on a timely basis. The Company has retained a significant portion of the risks related to its automobile, general liability, workers compensation and health claims programs. For its self-insured retentions, the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, is based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from the Company's assumptions used. The Company does not expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Litigation and Other Matters In February 2009, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries were named as defendants in a purported class action suit in the Circuit Court of Macon County, Alabama. Similar class action complaints were brought against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries in 2011 in Duval County, Florida and in 2013 in Quitman County, Georgia and Barbour County, Alabama, and in 2014 in Chester County, Pennsylvania. The 2013 Georgia complaint was dismissed in March 2014. In late 2015 in Gwinnett County, Georgia, another purported class action suit was filed. The plaintiffs in those cases primarily allege that the defendants charged improper fees (fuel, administrative and environmental fees) that were in breach of the plaintiffs' service agreements with the Company and seek damages in an unspecified amount. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses against these purported class actions, which it will vigorously pursue. Given the inherent uncertainties of litigation, including the early stage of these cases, the unknown size of any potential class, and legal and factual issues in dispute, the outcome of these cases cannot be predicted and a range of loss, if any, cannot currently be estimated. In November 2014, the Attorney General of the State of Vermont filed a complaint against the Company relating to the Moretown, Vermont landfill regarding alleged odor and other environmental-related noncompliances with environmental laws and regulations and environmental permits. In the complaint, the Attorney General requested that the State of Vermont Superior Court find the Company liable for the alleged noncompliances, issue related civil penalties, and order the Company to reimburse the State of Vermont for enforcement costs. While the complaint does not specify a monetary penalty, prior correspondence from the Attorney General of the State of Vermont indicates that it may seek a penalty relating to the alleged noncompliances that is not expected to be material. Given the inherent uncertainties of litigation, including the early stage of this case, the outcome cannot be predicted and a range of loss, if any, cannot currently be estimated. The Company is subject to various other proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims and regulatory investigations arising in the ordinary course of its business. Many of these actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against the Company include commercial, customer, and employment-related claims. The plaintiffs in some actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. These actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. Although the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome and the 13  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)   range of loss cannot be currently estimated, the Company does not believe that the eventual outcome of any such action could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  Multiemployer Defined Benefit Pension Plans Approximately 13% of the Company's workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements with various local unions across its operating regions. As a result of some of these agreements, certain of the Company's subsidiaries are participating employers in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer, defined benefit pension plans for the affected employees. In connection with its ongoing renegotiation of various collective bargaining agreements, the Company may discuss and negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans. A complete or partial withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan may also occur if employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement vote to decertify a union from continuing to represent them. The Company is not aware of any such actions in connection with continuing operations. As a result of certain discontinued operations, the Company is potentially exposed to certain withdrawal liabilities. The Company does not believe that any future withdrawals, individually or in the aggregate, from the multiemployer plans to which it contributes could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or liquidity. However, such withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations for a particular reporting period, depending on the number of employees withdrawn in any future period and the financial condition of the multiemployer plan(s) at the time of such withdrawal(s).  Tax Matters  The Company has open tax years dating back to 2000 in certain jurisdictions. Prior to the acquisition, MW Star Holdings, Corp. (Veolia ES Solid Waste division) was part of a consolidated group and is still subject to IRS and state examinations dating back to 2004. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition of Veolia ES Solid Waste, Inc., the Company is entitled to certain indemnifications for Veolia ES Solid Waste Division's pre-acquisition tax liabilities. The Company maintains a liability for uncertain tax positions, the balance of which management believes is adequate. Results of audit assessments by taxing authorities are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.  8. Segment and Related Information The Company manages and evaluates its operations primarily through its South, East and Midwest regional segments. These three groups are presented below as the Company's reportable segments. The Company's three geographic operating segments provide collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services. The Company serves residential, commercial and industrial, and municipal customers throughout its operating regions. Summarized financial information concerning its reportable segments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are shown in the table below: 14  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)    Fluctuations in the Company's operating results may be caused by many factors, including period-to-period changes in the relative contribution of revenue by each line of business and operating segment and by general economic conditions. In addition, its revenues and income from operations typically reflect seasonal patterns. The Company expects its operating results to vary seasonally, with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter, higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters. This seasonality reflects the lower volume of solid waste generated during the late fall, winter and early spring in the East and Midwest segments because of decreased construction and demolition activities during winter months in these regions of the United States. In addition, some of the Company's operating costs may be higher in the winter months. Adverse winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities, resulting in higher labor and operational costs. Greater precipitation in the winter increases the weight of collected municipal solid waste, resulting in higher disposal costs, which are calculated on a per ton basis. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as hurricanes that most often impact the South region, can increase the Company's revenues in the areas affected. While weather-related and other occurrences can boost revenues through additional work, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins. Certain weather conditions, including severe 15  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)   winter storms, may result in the temporary suspension of the Company's operations, which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions. No such events have occurred during the periods presented.   9. Fair Value Measurements Assets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value In measuring fair values of assets and liabilities, the Company uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs (Level 1) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs (Level 3). The Company also uses market data or assumptions that it believes market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk when appropriate. The carrying value for certain of the Company's financial instruments approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. The Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following:  The fair values of the fuel derivative instruments and interest rate caps are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices and interest rates based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in fair value hierarchy). Fair Value of Debt The fair value of the Company's debt (Level 2) is estimated using indirectly observable market inputs, except for the Revolver for which cost approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the interest rate. Although the Company 16  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)   has determined the estimated fair value amounts using quoted market prices, considerable judgment is required in interpreting the information and in developing the estimated fair values. Therefore, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company, or holders of the instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. The fair value estimates are based on information available as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 , respectively.  The estimated fair value of the Company's debt is as follows: The carrying value of the Company's debt at June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 was approximately $2,246.5 and $2,267.5 , respectively.  10. Stock-Based Compensation Amendment to Stock Incentive Plan During the second quarter of 2016, the Board of Directors of the Parent amended the Advanced Disposal Waste Holdings Corp. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2012 Plan) to allow for the grant of performance shares, restricted shares, restricted share units, and other equity awards in addition to stock options and stock purchase rights as originally provided for under the 2012 Plan. Named Executive Officer (NEO) Grants During the second quarter of 2016, there were 637 NEO restricted stock grants under the 2012 Plan with a fair value of $1,158.29 per share. The restricted stock will vest in three equal installments over each of the first three anniversaries of the date of the grant. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, none of the NEO restricted stock was forfeited. As of June 30, 2016, there were 637 shares of restricted stock outstanding under the 2012 Plan. During the second quarter of 2016, there were 1,274 NEO performance share units (PSUs) issued under the 2012 Plan with a fair value of $1,158.29 per share. The PSU's will vest in full on the third anniversary of the date of the grant. The PSU's shall be measured based on the Parent's budget and are weighted as follows: EBITDA: 50% ; Free Cash Flow: 30% ; and Revenue: 20% . The measurement criteria begin with an attainment of 90% of the budget which results in vesting of 25% of the shares underlying the PSU's granted and ends with an attainment of 110% of the budget which results in vesting of 175% of the shares underlying the PSU's granted. Performance will be measured separately for each of the three years in the performance period and the total number of PSU's earned at the conclusion of the three year performance period will be the sum of the PSU's earned with respect to each individual year. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, none of the NEO PSU's were forfeited. As of June 30, 2016, there were 1,274 PSU's outstanding under the 2012 Plan. During the second quarter of 2016, there were 2,032 NEO option grants under the 2012 Plan. The options will vest in three equal installments over each of the first three anniversaries of the date of the grant. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, none of these NEO options were forfeited or exercised. As of June 30, 2016, there were 2,032 options outstanding under the NEO plan. The weighted average exercise price of outstanding NEO options was $1,158.29 . The weighted average remaining contractual term for the outstanding NEO options was ten years as of June 30, 2016. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company and its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), entered into an amendment to the CEO's employment agreement. The amendment adjusts the performance criteria applicable to performance-based stock options that the CEO is eligible to earn with respect to 2016. Previously, the only applicable criterion was EBITDA; the amendment provides that the number of performance-based stock options earned will be based on EBITDA ( 50% ) and free cash flow ( 50% ). The amendment also clarifies that the full potential grant of performance-based stock options (covering up to 4,000 shares of Parent's common stock) is still available to be earned by the CEO. Total unrecognized compensation expense for all of the above NEO grants (including the impact of the amendment to the CEO performance-based stock options) was approximately $3.7 as of June 30, 2016, which will be recognized over the next 3.5 years . For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, compensation expense for all of the above NEO grants 17  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)   (including the impact of the amendment to the CEO performance-based stock options) was approximately $0.0 due to the awards being granted during the last week of the second quarter. Annual Stock Option Grants During the second quarter of 2016, there were 11,656 annual grants under the 2012 Plan for employees other than the NEO's. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 , 1,803 annual options were forfeited. No annual options were exercised for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Total unrecognized compensation expense for the annual awards was approximately $4.1 as of June 30, 2016, which will be recognized over the next 3.1 years. For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, compensation expense for the annual options was approximately $1.0 and $0.2 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, compensation expense for the annual options was $1.2 and $0.7 , respectively. Strategic Stock Option Grants During the six months ended June 30, 2016, there were no strategic grant issuances under the 2012 Plan. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, 1,481 strategic options were forfeited. No strategic options were exercised for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Total unrecognized compensation expense for the strategic awards was approximately $1.6 as of June 30, 2016, which will be recognized over the next 2.9 years. For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, compensation expense for the strategic options was approximately $0.2 and $0.3 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, compensation expense for the strategic options was $0.4 and $0.5 , respectively.  11. Guarantor Financial Statements  All borrowings under the Term Loan B and the Revolver are guaranteed by each of the Company's current and future U.S. subsidiaries (which also guarantee the Senior Notes), subject to certain agreed-upon exemptions. The Company has one non-guarantor foreign subsidiary, Sanitation Services Company Limited, which exceeded 3% of pretax income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. As a result, the Company is providing the following condensed consolidating financial information in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements. Prior periods are not presented as the non guarantor subsidiary was minor.                              18  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016           19  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)   Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016                           20  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)     Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016                          21  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)    Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016  22 Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)    12. Subsequent Events  Return of Capital to the Parent   On August 3, 2016, the Board of Directors approved $10.6 of capital to be returned to the parent.  Amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement   On August 4, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement dated October 9, 2012. The amendment, among other things, extended the maturity date with respect to approximately $280.0 of the Company's $300.0 commitments under the revolving credit facility to October 2019.  23  
Item2. Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included under Item1. In addition, you should refer to our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations appearing in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. All dollar amounts are presented in millions, unless otherwise stated. Overview We are a leading integrated provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services, operating primarily in secondary markets or under exclusive arrangements. We have a presence in 16 states across the Midwest, South and East regions of the United States, serving approximately 2.8 million residential and 221,000 commercial and industrial (C&I) customers through our extensive network of 92 collection operations, 72 transfer stations, 21 owned or operated recycling facilities and 39 owned or operated landfills. We seek to drive financial performance in markets in which we own or operate a landfill or in certain disposal-neutral markets, where the landfill is owned by our municipal customer. In markets in which we own or operate a landfill, we aim to create and maintain vertically integrated operations through which we manage a majority of our customers' waste from the point of collection through the point of disposal, a process we refer to as internalization. By internalizing a majority of the waste in these markets, we are able to deliver high quality customer service while also ensuring a stable revenue stream and maximizing profitability and cash flow from operations. In disposal-neutral markets, we focus selectively on opportunities where we can negotiate exclusive arrangements with our municipal customers, facilitating highly-efficient and profitable collection operations with lower capital requirements. Geographically, we focus our business principally in secondary, or less densely populated non-urban, markets where the presence of large national providers is generally more limited. We also compete selectively in primary, or densely populated urban, markets where we can capitalize on opportunities for vertical integration through our high-quality transfer and disposal infrastructure and where we can benefit from highly-efficient collection route density. We maintain an attractive mix of revenue from varying sources, including residential collections, C&I collections, landfill gas and special waste streams, and fees charged to third parties for disposal in our network of transfer stations and landfills. Results of Operations The following table sets forth for the periods indicated our consolidated results of operations and the percentage relationship that certain items from our condensed consolidated financial statements bear to revenue (in millions and as a percentage of our revenue).  24  Three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015 Operating income increased  $22.4 or 163.5% to $36.1 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 . The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily the result of losses on disposal of businesses and impairment charges recorded in the 2015 period of $17.4 relating to strategic decisions regarding divestitures in the South segment and discontinuing the pursuit of permitting at one landfill site. Additionally, the increase was due to higher environmental fees of $2.9 due to an increased rate that went into effect in July 2015 and lower net fuel costs of $1.3 due to lower diesel fuel prices. Additional offsetting variances are described in the detailed discussion later in the MD&A.  Six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015 Operating income increased $11.4 or 30.2% to $49.1 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily the result of losses on disposal of businesses and impairment charges recorded in the 2015 period of $17.4 relating to strategic decisions regarding divestitures in the South segment and discontinuing the pursuit of permitting at one landfill site. The increase in operating income was partially offset by expenses of $7.1 related to the launch of the February initial public offering process, including the amendment of our credit agreement contingent on an initial public offering. Additional offsetting variances are described in the detailed discussion later in the MD&A. Revenue  Through our subsidiaries, we generate revenue primarily by providing collection and disposal services to commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. Our remaining revenue is generated from recycling, fuel and environmental fees, landfill gas-to-energy operations and other ancillary revenue-generating activities. Revenues from our collection operations consist of fees we receive from municipal, subscription, residential and commercial and industrial ("C&I") customers and are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the recycling, transfer station or disposal facilities and our disposal costs. Standard C&I service agreements are typically three to five years, and we have historically maintained strong relationships with our C&I customers. Our municipal customer relationships are generally supported by exclusive contracts ranging from three to ten years in initial duration with subsequent renewal periods. Certain municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as the consumer price index. We provide commercial front load and temporary and permanent rolloff service offerings to our commercial customers. While the majority of our rolloff services are provided to customers under long-term service agreements, we generally do not enter into contracts with our temporary rolloff customers due to the relatively short-term nature of most construction and demolition (C&D) projects.  Our transfer stations and landfills generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue consists of disposal or tipping fees and proceeds from the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties.  The amounts charged for collection, disposal, and recycling services may include fuel fees and environmental fees. Fuel fees and environmental fees are not designed to be specific to the direct costs and expenses to service an individual customer's account, but rather are designed to address and to help recover for changes in our overall cost structure and to achieve an operating margin acceptable to us.  Other revenue is comprised of ancillary revenue-generating activities, such as trucking, landfill gas-to-energy operations at municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills, management of third-party owned landfills, customer service charges relating to overdue payments and customer administrative fees relating to customers who request paper copies of invoices rather than opting for electronic invoices. The following table sets forth our consolidated revenues by line of business for the periods indicated (in millions and as a percentage of total services revenues).  25  Three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015 Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $358.2 , an  increase of $3.0 or 0.8% from revenue of $355.2 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 . The revenue change was impacted by the following:    Collection revenue increased by $1.9 or 0.8% of which $1.7 was from the commercial business resulting from acquisitions and pricing initiatives across all segments and $0.9 in the residential business due to acquisitions and new contracts in the South and East segments partially offset by the loss of residential contracts in the Midwest segment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 from our rolloff business due to lower shale volumes in the East segment as a result of the continued decline in the oil and gas market and lower volume in the Midwest segment.    Disposal revenue increased by $4.9 or 3.7% due to increased volume across all waste streams, except shale, most notably in our East and South segments.    Sale of recyclables decreased by $0.6 or 9.8% primarily due to a divestiture completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 which accounted for a variance of $1.0, partially offset by price increases of certain recycled commodities.    Fuel fees and environmental fees remained flat at $20.9 driven by decreased fuel fees as a result of lower diesel fuel prices offset by increased environmental fees due to an increased rate that went into effect in July 2015.    Other revenue decreased by $1.1 or 5.6% , primarily due to lower revenue related to ancillary shale related services.  Six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015 Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $692.0, an increase of $6.5 or 0.9% from revenue of $685.5 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The revenue change was impacted by the following:    Collection revenue increased by $5.6 or 1.2% of which $3.7 was from the commercial business due to acquisitions and pricing initiatives, $1.3 from the residential business due to acquisitions and new contracts in the South and East segments partially offset by the loss of residential contracts in the Midwest segment, and $0.6 from the rolloff business due to lower shale volumes in the East segment and lower volume in the Midwest segment partially offset by price and volume growth in our South segment.    Disposal revenue increased by $15.6 or 6.5% due to increased volume across all waste streams, except shale, most notably in our South and East segments.    Sale of recyclables decreased by $2.1 or 17.8%, primarily due to a divestiture completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 which accounted for $2.0 of the variance.    Fuel fees and environmental fees decreased by $1.1 or 2.7%, driven by decreased fuel fees as a result of lower diesel fuel prices which contributed $7.2 partially offset by increased environmental fees of $6.1 due to an increased rate that went into effect in July 2015.  26   Other revenue decreased by $4.9 or 11.2%, due to the sale of a small brokerage business in April 2015 which contributed $3.2 of the decline, lower trucking revenue of $1.6 due to lower volume of special waste projects and a reduction in landfill gas revenue which contributed $1.3 of the decline. Landfill gas revenue decreased due to the expiration of landfill gas credit agreements and a decline in the market price for landfill gas.  Operating Expenses The following table summarizes our operating expenses (in millions and as a percentage of our revenue).  Our operating expenses include the following:    Labor and related benefits, which consist of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits, incentive compensation and payroll taxes.    Transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations as well as transportation and subcontractor costs (which include costs for independent haulers who transport waste from transfer stations to our disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with markets outside our standard operating areas).    Maintenance and repairs expenses which include labor, maintenance and repairs to our vehicles, equipment and containers.    Fuel costs which include the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of fuel tax credits.    Franchise fees and taxes which consist of municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties.    Risk management expenses which include casualty insurance premiums and claims payments and estimates for claims incurred but not reported.    Other expenses which include expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent, leachate treatment and disposal, and other landfill maintenance costs.    Accretion expense related to landfill capping, closure and post-closure is included in operating expenses in our condensed consolidated income statements, but, it is excluded from the table below (refer to "Accretion of Landfill Retirement Obligations" for a detailed discussion of the changes in amounts).  The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, excluding accretion expense on our landfill retirement obligations (in millions and as a percentage of our revenue): 27 The cost categories shown above may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. Thus, you should exercise caution when comparing our operating expenses by cost component to that of other companies.  Three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015 Operating expenses decreased by $1.9 or 0.9% to $215.8 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $217.7 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 . The change was due to the following:    Labor and related benefits increased by $1.5 or 2.1% to $73.1 which was primarily attributable to merit increases, acquisition activity and startup costs for new municipal contracts and acquisitions. The increases were partially offset by disposals of certain businesses in the prior year and a $0.2 reduction in workers compensation costs.    Transfer and disposal costs decreased by $1.6 or 3.2% to $48.0 primarily due to increased internalization of waste in the Midwest segment and decreased trucking expense related to special waste projects.    Maintenance and repairs expense increased by $1.7 or 5.4% to $33.1 . The increase was driven primarily by the implementation of a standardized maintenance plan on our collection fleet and landfill equipment which resulted in increased labor and material costs. Additionally, costs increased $0.5 as a result of start up costs for new municipal contracts and acquisitions.    Fuel costs decreased  $4.5 or 24.3% to $14.0 primarily resulting from decreases in fuel prices and converting trucks to compressed natural gas fuel, which is less expensive than diesel fuel.    Franchise fees and taxes decreased  $1.2 or 6.6% to $17.0 primarily due to changes in the mix of waste in the Midwest segment.    Risk management expenses increased  $0.3 or 4.5% to $6.9 primarily due to the favorable settlement of a large legacy claim in the prior year quarter.    Other operating costs increased  $1.9 or 8.7% to $23.7 primarily due to increased landfill site and other facility operating expenses of $1.3.  Six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015 Operating expenses increased by $3.6 or 0.9% to $425.8 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $422.2 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The change was due to the following:  28   Labor and related benefits increased by $4.7 or 3.3% to $146.3 which was primarily attributable to merit increases, acquisition activity, startup costs for new municipal contracts and acquisitions. The increases were partially offset by disposals of certain businesses in the prior year and a $1.2 reduction in workers compensation costs.    Transfer and disposal costs decreased by $1.7 or 1.8% to $93.6 due to the sale of a small brokerage business in April 2015 which contributed $3.8 of the decline and increased internalization in the Midwest. These decreases were partially offset by increased container weights during the first quarter of 2016.    Maintenance and repairs expense increased by $5.2 or 8.7% to $65.2. The increase was driven primarily by the implementation of a standardized maintenance plan on our collection fleet and landfill equipment which resulted in increased labor and material costs. Additionally, costs increased $1.6 as a result of start up costs for new municipal contracts and acquisitions.    Fuel costs decreased $9.9 or 27.4% to $26.2 primarily resulting from decreases in fuel prices and converting trucks to compressed natural gas fuel, which is less expensive than diesel fuel.    Franchise fees and taxes decreased $0.7 or 2.2% to $31.6 primarily due to changes in the mix of waste in the Midwest segment.    Risk management expenses increased $2.5 or 19.5% to $15.3. The six months ended June 30, 2015 benefited $0.8 from the favorable settlement of a legacy claim and favorable actuarial development in our vehicle liability insurance programs which did not reoccur in the six months ended June 30, 2016.    Other operating costs increased $3.5 or 7.9% to $47.6 primarily due to increased landfill site and other facility operating expenses of $1.8 and increased costs related to leachate treatment and disposal due to wet weather in the first quarter of 2016 of $1.1. Accretion of Landfill Retirement Obligations Accretion expense was $3.3 and $3.4 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $0.1 was primarily attributable to the timing of certain capping obligations. Accretion expense was $6.5 and $6.7 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $0.2 was primarily attributable to the timing of certain capping obligations. For a discussion of factors affecting capping obligations, see the critical accounting policies in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, legal and professional fees and other expenses. Salaries expenses include salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management, field support functions, sales force, accounting and finance, legal, management information systems, and clerical and administrative departments. Other expenses include rent and office costs, fees for professional services provided by third parties, marketing, directors' and officers' insurance, general employee relocation, travel, entertainment and bank charges, but exclude any such amounts recorded as restructuring charges. The following table provides the components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated (in millions and as a percentage of our revenue):  29  Three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015   Our salaries expenses increased by $3.6 or 16.3% to $25.7 primarily attributable to increased stock based compensation of $2.4 and $1.1 of increased wages due to merit increases and acquisition activity.   Legal and professional fees decreased  $0.6 or 20.7% to $2.3 which was primarily the result of a reduction in consulting fees associated with internal control evaluation and implementation and the favorable settlement of a legal matter which contributed $0.3 to the decrease.   Other selling, general and administrative expenses increased  $0.1 or 0.9% to $11.2. Six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015   Our salaries expenses increased by $5.5 or 12.1% to $50.8 attributable to increased stock based compensation of $2.1 with the remainder primarily due to merit increases and acquisition activity.   Legal and professional fees increased $6.7 or 124.1% to $12.1 which was primarily the result of expenses related to the launch of the initial public offering process in the amount of $7.1, including the amendment of our credit agreement contingent on an initial public offering.   Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $1.0 or 4.5% to $21.2.   Depreciation and Amortization The following table summarizes the components of depreciation and amortization expense by asset type (in millions and as a percentage of our revenue). For a detailed discussion of depreciation and amortization by asset type refer to the discussion included in the following two sections herein.  Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment Depreciation, amortization and depletion expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight-line method, and amortization and depletion of landfill airspace assets under the units-of-consumption method. Refer to the footnotes of the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our accounting policies. The following table summarizes depreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the periods indicated (in millions and as a percentage of our revenue): 30 Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment remained constant at $31.8 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 , as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 . Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment remained constant at $63.4 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. Landfill depletion and amortization decreased  $1.8 to $21.9 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 , as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase in deemed permitted expansion airspace resulting from favorable developments in permitting activities at several of our landfills. The impact of increased deemed permitted airspace was partially offset by increased disposal volumes. Landfill depletion and amortization decreased $2.2 to $40.3 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase in deemed permitted expansion airspace resulting from favorable developments in permitting activities at several of our landfills. The impact of increased deemed permitted airspace was partially offset by increased disposal volumes. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Amortization of other intangible assets was $10.9 and $11.0 or as a percentage of revenue, 3.0% and 3.1% , for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in amortization expense is attributable to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. Amortization of other intangible assets was $21.7 and $21.5 or as a percentage of revenue, 3.1% and 3.1%, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in amortization expense is directly attributable to increased acquisition activity in the prior year. Acquisitions In the ordinary course of our business, we regularly evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that further enhance our vertical integration strategy.  We completed six acquisitions during the six months ended June 30, 2016 for a cash purchase price of $4.9 and notes payable of $0.3, subject to net working capital adjustments, which we expect to be completed within approximately one year. The results of operations of each acquisition are included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations subsequent to the closing date of each acquisition. Seven acquisitions were completed during the six months ended June 30, 2015 for a cash purchase price of $23.8 and notes payable of $3.3. The results of operations of each acquisition are included in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations subsequent to the closing date of each acquisition.    Impairments  The Company disposed of certain businesses in June 2015 and recorded a loss on disposal of $10.9 for the three and six months ending June 30, 2015. In connection with the sale, the Company impaired certain assets in the amount of $4.3 in the three and six months ending June 30, 2015. Further, the Company strategically allowed an inactive landfill permit to lapse and in connection with the permit lapse recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2.1 primarily for permitting costs in the three and six months ending June 30, 2015. No such amounts were recorded for the three and six months ending June 30, 2016. Other, Net 31 Changes in the fair value and settlements of the fuel derivative instruments are recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and amounted to income of $2.1 and $4.8 for the three months ended June30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.5 and ($.2), respectively. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate caps purchased in May of 2016 are recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and amounted to a loss of $2.8 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. Income from equity investee for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively was $0.5 and $0.4 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.1 and $0.8, respectively. Income from a gain on redemption of a security of $2.5 was recorded in other income (expense), net during the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.  Interest Expense The $1.4 decrease in interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 is principally due to lower average balances on the Term Loan B. The $1.2 decrease in interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 is principally due to lower average balances on the Term Loan B. Income Taxes The Company's effective income tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was 90.5% and 38.4%, respectively. We evaluate our effective income tax rate at each interim period and adjust it accordingly as facts and circumstances warrant. The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of permanently non-deductible expenses included in stock-based compensation. These items had a greater impact on the Company's effective income tax rate during the three months ended June 30, 2016 than in comparable prior periods due to the Company's pre-tax earnings being near break-even for the three month period ending June 30, 2016. The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was primarily due to the mix of income in the states in which the Company operates. The Company's effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was 26.6% and 32.0%, respectively. The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of permanently non-deductible expenses and the unfavorable impact of the change in recorded valuation allowance. The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the change in recorded valuation allowance. Reportable Segments Our operations are managed through three geographic regions (South, East and Midwest) that we designate as our reportable segments. Revenues and operating income/(loss) for our reportable segments for the periods indicated, are shown in the following tables:  32 Comparison of Reportable Segments- Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015  South Segment Revenue increased  $2.5 or 2.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in disposal revenue of $2.0 as a result of higher price and volume, an increase in residential collection revenue of $0.8 due to acquisitions in the prior year and new contract starts in the prior year partially offset by the loss of certain municipal contracts, an increase in commercial collection revenue of $0.9 due to higher volume partly due to acquisitions in the prior year partially offset by a divestiture in the prior year, an increase in rolloff revenue of $1.0 due to price and volume, and an increase in environmental fees of $0.7 due to an increased rate that went into effect in July 2015. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in recycling revenue of $1.0 due to a prior year divestiture, a decrease in fuel fee revenue of $0.8 as a result of lower diesel fuel prices, and a decrease in trucking revenue of $0.5 due to lower volume of special waste projects. Operating income from our South Segment increased by $16.4 or 292.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 . The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily the result of losses on disposal of businesses and impairment charges recorded in the 2015 period of $15.2 related to strategic divestitures. 33 Additionally, operating income increased due to the revenue increase discussed above which contributed $1.1 to the increase after direct expenses, lower disposal fees of $1.0 due to lower third party fees, and lower fuel expense of $1.9 due to lower diesel fuel prices. These increase were partially offset by higher labor costs of $1.3 due to merit increases and acquisition activity and higher repairs and maintenance expense of $1.3 due to the implementation of a standardized maintenance plan on our collection fleet and landfill equipment and acquisition activity. East Segment Revenue increased by $3.0 , or 3.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 . The increase is primarily due to an increase in commercial collection revenue of $1.0 due to prior year acquisitions and higher price, an increase in residential collection revenue of $1.5 due to acquisitions in the prior year and new contract starts, an increase in rolloff revenue of $0.5 due to higher price, an increase in C&D landfill disposal revenue of $1.3 due to higher price and volume, an increase in revenue of $0.9 related to increased special waste volumes, an increase in disposal revenue of $0.7 due to an acquired transfer station in the prior year, and an increase in environmental fees of $0.6 due to an increased rate that went into effect in July 2015. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in disposal revenue of $1.2 due to the divestiture of three transfer stations, a reduction in revenue of $1.2 from shale volumes due to the continued decline in the oil and gas market, and a reduction in fuel fees of $0.4 as a result of lower diesel fuel prices. Operating income from our East Segment increased $4.2 or 84.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 . The increase is due to not continuing to pursue permitting at one landfill site in the prior year which resulted in expense of $2.1. Additionally, operating income increased due to the revenue increase discussed above which contributed $1.3 to the increase after direct expenses and lower fuel expenses of $1.3 due to lower diesel fuel prices. These increases were partially offset by higher insurance expense of $0.5 and higher salaries and wages of $0.5.  Midwest Segment Revenue decreased  $2.5 or 1.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 . The decrease is primarily due to lower collection revenue of $2.1 due to the loss of residential contracts and lower fuel fees of $2.0 due to the reduction in diesel fuel prices. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental fees of $1.6 due to an increased rate that went into effect in July 2015. Operating income from our Midwest Segment increased by $3.5 or 20.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 . The increase in operating income is due to higher environmental fees of $1.6 due to an increased rate that went into effect in July 2015 and a reduction in wages of $1.0 due to a decrease in driver headcount. Corporate Region Operating loss increased  $1.7 or 12.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 , primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation of $2.4.  Comparison of Reportable Segments-Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 South Segment Revenue increased $1.2 or 0.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in disposal revenue of $5.1 as a result of higher price and volume, an increase in residential collection revenue of $1.2 due to acquisitions in the prior year and new contract starts in the prior year partially offset by the loss of certain municipal contracts, an increase in commercial collection revenue of $1.2 due to increased volume partly due to acquisitions in the prior year partially offset by a divestiture in the prior year, an increase in rolloff revenue of $1.9 due to price and volume, and an increase in environmental fees of $1.4 due to an increased rate that went into effect in July 2015. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue of $6.2 due to the divestiture of businesses in the prior year, a decrease in fuel fee revenue of $2.0 as a result of lower diesel fuel prices, a decrease in landfill gas revenue of $1.1 due to the expiration of landfill gas credit agreements and a decline in the market price for landfill gas, and a decrease in trucking revenue of $0.5 due to the timing of special waste projects. 34 Operating income from our South Segment increased by $13.6 or 48.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily the result of losses on disposal of businesses and impairment charges recorded in the 2015 period of $15.2 related to strategic divestitures. Additionally, operating income increased due to the revenue increase discussed above which contributed $2.1 to the increase after direct expenses and lower fuel fees of $4.1 due to lower diesel fuel prices. These increases were partially offset by higher labor costs of $3.3 due to increased headcount, merit increases, and start up costs related to acquisitions and new municipal contracts and higher repairs and maintenance expense of $2.9 due to the implementation of a standardized maintenance plan on our collection fleet and landfill equipment and acquisition activity. East Segment Revenue increased by $7.0 or 3.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase is primarily due to an increase in commercial collection revenue of $2.0 due to prior year acquisitions and higher price, an increase in residential collection revenue of $2.4 due to acquisitions in the prior year and new contract starts, an increase in rolloff revenue of $1.1 due to higher price, an increase in disposal revenue of $5.1 due to increased volume and an increase in environmental fees of $1.4 due to an increased rate that went into effect in July 2015. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in disposal revenue of $1.2 due to the divestiture of three transfer stations, a reduction in revenue of $2.5 from shale volumes due to the continued decline in the oil and gas market, and a reduction in fuel fees of $1.0 as a result of lower diesel fuel prices. Operating income from our East Segment increased $4.3 or 50.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase is due to not continuing to pursue permitting at one landfill site in the prior year which resulted in expense of $2.1. Additionally, operating income increased due to the revenue increase discussed above which contributed $2.3 to the increase after direct expenses and lower fuel expense of $2.5 due to lower diesel fuel prices. These increases were partially offset by higher insurance expense of $0.7, higher salaries and wages of $1.2 and higher repair and maintenance expense of $0.5.  Midwest Segment Revenue decreased $1.7 or 0.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower collection revenue of $0.5 due to the loss of residential contracts and lower fuel fees of $4.5 due to the reduction in diesel fuel prices. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental fees of $3.2 due to an increased rate that went into effect in July 2015. Operating income from our Midwest Segment increased by $4.0 or 14.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in operating income is due to higher environmental fees of $3.2 due to an increased rate that went into effect in July 2015 and a reduction in wages of $0.8 due to a decrease in driver headcount. Corporate Region Operating loss increased $10.5 or 38.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to $7.5 in expenses related to the launch of the initial public offering process and the evaluation of strategic alternatives, including the amendment of our credit agreement contingent on an initial public offering. Additionally, stock based compensation expense increased by $2.1. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operations, bank borrowings and debt offerings. We intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities, together with bank borrowings, to fund purchases of property and equipment, working capital, acquisitions and debt repayments. Actual debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise. We believe that our current cash balances, cash from operating activities and funds available under our Revolver will provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due. At June30, 2016 , the Company had negative working capital which was driven by purchases of property and equipment and construction and development during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as well as the use of our cash to fund debt repayments and to return capital to the parent. At December 31, 2015, we had negative working capital which was driven by repayments on the Term Loan B and cash used for acquisitions. The Company has more than adequate availability on its Revolver to fund short term working capital requirements.  35 Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents and Debt Obligations The table below presents a summary of our cash and cash equivalents and debt balances (in millions): Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following table sets forth for the periods indicated a summary of our cash flows (in millions): Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities We generated $104.4 of cash flows from operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 , compared with $129.3 during the six months ended June 30, 2015 . The decrease of $24.9 was due in part to an increase in accounts receivable in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a decrease in the comparable prior period which accounted for $11.1 of the variance. The accounts receivable increase is due to increased emphasis on collection activities starting in late 2014 that resulted in significant improvement in days sales outstanding throughout 2015. Higher capping, closure and post closure expenditures contributed $5.0 to the decrease and was due to timing of payments and an increase in required capping events in 2016 compared to 2015. Higher payments on accrued expenses of $4.8 also contributed to the decrease and was due primarily to higher bonus payments in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 2015. Cash flows from operations are used to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, interest payments and debt and capital repayments.  Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities We used $70.8 of cash in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared with $85.3 during the six months ended June 30, 2015 , a  decrease of $14.5 , which was primarily attributable to reduced capital spending of $20.5 mostly due to the timing of projects and reduced acquisition spending of $18.7 due to a large acquisition during the first quarter of 2015. These reductions in spending were partially offset by the redemption of an investment security for $15.0 during the six months ended June 30, 2015 and a reduction in proceeds from divestitures of $10.0 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities During the six months ended June 30, 2016 , net cash used in financing activities was $33.0 compared to $35.7 during the six months ended June 30, 2015 , a decrease of $2.7 . The decrease is primarily due to higher proceeds related to bank overdrafts of $12.6 due to the timing of payments partially offset by higher net payments of debt of $4.7 and a higher return of capital to the parent of $5.1. Senior Secured Credit Facilities In November 2012, we entered into (i)a $1,800.0 term loan B facility and (ii)a $300.0 Revolver and together with the Term Loan B, (the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as administrative agent, and affiliates of Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., UBS Securities LLC and 36 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, and other lenders from time to time party thereto and effected re-pricing transactions on the Term Loan B in February 2014 and February 2013, that reduced the applicable interest rate floor by 50 basis points and the applicable margin by 100 basis points, respectively. See Note 4, Debt, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 , for additional details regarding our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities can be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. As of June30, 2016 , we had an aggregate committed capacity of $300.0 , of which $100.0 was available for letters of credit. At June30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of approximately $46.0 and$45.9, respectively, of letters of credit outstanding. At June30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $11.0 and $32.0, respectively, of borrowings on the Revolver. The agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities requires us to comply with certain financial and other covenants, including a total leverage ratio for the benefit of the lenders under the Revolver that is applicable when there are outstanding loans or letters of credit under the Revolver. Compliance with these covenants is a condition to any incremental borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans (which would adversely affect our liquidity). As of June30, 2016 , we were in compliance with the covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our ability to maintain compliance with our covenants will be highly dependent on our results of operations and, to the extent necessary, our ability to implement remedial measures such as reductions in operating costs. We are subject to a total leverage ratio covenant for the applicable periods as indicated.  At June30, 2016 , the total leverage ratio was 6.02:1:00. 8 1/4% Senior Notes due 2020 On October9, 2012, we issued $550.0 aggregate principal amount of 8 1/4% Senior Notes due 2020 pursuant to an indenture between the Company, the guarantor party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. As of June30, 2016 , we were in compliance with the covenants under the Indenture. See Note 4, Debt, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the notes. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 , we had no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases, which are not classified as debt. We do not guarantee any third-party debt. Seasonality We expect our operating results to vary seasonally, with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter, higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters. This seasonality reflects the lower volume of solid waste generated during the late fall, winter and early spring in the East and Midwest segments because of decreased construction and demolition activities during winter months in these regions of the U.S. In addition, some of our operating costs may be higher in the winter months. Adverse winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities, resulting in higher labor and operational costs. Greater precipitation in the winter increases the weight of collected municipal solid waste, resulting in higher disposal costs, which are calculated on a per ton basis. Liquidity Impacts of Income Tax Items Uncertain Tax Positions-As of June30, 2016 , we have $10.0 of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. These liabilities are primarily included as a component of other long-term liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet because the Company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments 37 required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity.  Financial Assurance We must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping, closure and post-closure costs, and related to our performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts. We satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds and letters of credit. The amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations. The financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill. Generally, states require a third-party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping, closure and post-closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill. The amount of financial assurance required can, and generally will, differ from the obligation determined and recorded under U.S. GAAP. The amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract. Additionally, we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations. We do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements in the foreseeable future, although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change. These financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness. Because we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments, they are not reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. However, we record capping, closure and post-closure liabilities and self-insurance liabilities as they are incurred. The underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments, in excess of those already reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations. We do not expect this to occur. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management's most subjective judgments. A summary of significant accounting policies is disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our critical accounting policies are further described under the caption "Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Recently Issued and Proposed Accounting Standards For a description of new accounting standards that may affect us, see Note 2, Basis of Presentation, to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part 1 of this Form 10-Q.
