Business Operations Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, as a consolidated entity, is a nonhazardous solid waste services company providing collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services to customers in the South, Midwest and Eastern regions of the United States. The Company manages and evaluates its principal operations through three reportable operating segments on a regional basis. Those operating segments are the South, East and Midwest regions which provide collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services. Additional information related to segments can be found in Note 9. Eight acquisitions were completed during the six months ended June 30, 2017 for aggregate consideration consisting of a cash purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $84.3 and notes payable of $1.6 subject to net working capital adjustments and other commitments, which are expected to be completed within approximately one year. The Company assumed approximately $3.9 in closure and post-closure liabilities associated with the acquisitions. Six acquisitions were completed during the six months ended June 30, 2016 for a cash purchase price of $4.9 and notes payable of $0.3 . The results of operations of each acquisition are included in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations subsequent to the closing date of each acquisition. The Company is still reviewing information surrounding property and equipment, intangible assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities related to acquisitions completed subsequent to June 30, 2016. See Note 11, Acquisitions, to the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further details on acquisitions completed during the six months ended June 30, 2017 . During the six months ended June 30, 2017 , the Company entered into an Asset Transfer and Liability Assumption Agreement with BFI Waste Systems of North America, LLC. The Company received a cash payment of $24.0 which was recorded as an operating cash flow. In exchange for this payment, the Company assumed certain post-closure liabilities of a closed portion of a landfill and became responsible for expenditures related to a gas infrastructure system. The assumed post-closure liabilities and expenditures related to the gas infrastructure system approximate the amount of the cash payment. The payments related to the assumed post-closure liabilities and expenditures related to the gas infrastructure system will be made in future periods.  During the three and six months ended June30, 2017 , the Company divested of its collection services operation in Charlotte, North Carolina for consideration received of $8.7 . A $1.4 gain on the sale of that business is included in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 .  2. Basis of Presentation The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements include its wholly-owned subsidiaries and their respective subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements as of June30, 2017 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 are unaudited. In the opinion of management, these condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which, unless otherwise disclosed, are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the balance sheet, results of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, cash flows, and changes in equity for the periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. The financial statements presented herein should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2016 . In conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the Company uses estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that it uses is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In preparing the Company's financial statements, the more subjective areas that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to: accounting for long-lived assets, including recoverability; landfill development costs, final capping, closure and post-closure costs; valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets; liabilities for potential litigation; claims and assessments; liabilities for environmental remediation; stock compensation; accounting for goodwill and intangible asset impairments; deferred taxes; uncertain tax positions; self-insurance reserves; and estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that the Company uses in preparation of its financial statements.   Intangible Asset Impairment The Company has collection operations in South Carolina which operate in a competitor-owned disposal market that does not align with the Company's long-term market strategy of vertically integrated operations with Company-owned disposal sites or marketplace neutral disposal sites. During April of 2017, changes in facts and circumstances led the Company to evaluate the long-term market for South Carolina collection operations and re-evaluate the expected cash flows provided by this market. The Company determined it appropriate to impair certain intangible assets that were recorded as part of the purchase accounting when these entities were acquired. Based on the Company's evaluation, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment of $13.0 during the second quarter of 2017. Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-04 which simplifies the goodwill impairment test by eliminating step 2 of the quantitative assessment. Under the guidance, when a quantitative assessment is required, an entity will perform a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge will be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, entities should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. This amended guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2020 and early adoption of the standard is permitted. The Company's early adoption on January 1, 2017 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01 which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments provide a screen to determine when a set of assets and activities is not a business. If the screen is not met, the amendments require further consideration of inputs, substantive processes and outputs to determine whether the transaction is an acquisition of a business. The new update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company's early adoption on January 1, 2017 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which will require lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding lease liability, and lessors to recognize a net lease investment. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures will also be required to increase transparency and comparability among organizations. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, however; the Company does not expect to early adopt the ASU. Lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. While the Company is still assessing the impact of this standard, it does not believe this standard will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance. The new standard requires that a company recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Companies will need to use more judgment and estimates than under the guidance currently in effect, including estimating the amount of variable revenue to recognize over each identified performance obligation. Additional disclosures will be required to help users of financial statements understand the nature, amount and timing of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts. This standard will become effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter 2018 and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company anticipates adopting the standard as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  To assess the impact of the standard, the Company is using internal resources to lead the implementation efforts. The Company's internal resources reviewed the amended guidance, attended training classes and consulted with other accounting professionals to assist with interpretation of the amended guidance. The Company completed an impact assessment of the guidance changes affecting the Company and developed an approach to address each change. The Company completed a review of its municipal contracts and documented key contract terms for areas impacted by the amended guidance. The Company is in the process of sampling additional contracts based on specifically identified contract characteristics that could be accounted for differently under the amended guidance. Changes to processes and internal controls are being identified to meet the standard's reporting and disclosure requirements. The Company continues to work through an analysis of the increased disclosures required by the new guidance. The Company has determined that sales commissions previously recorded as expense in the income statement when earned will be recorded as a contract asset under the amended guidance. The Company is in process of determining the appropriate amortization period for these sales commissions. The Company is still in the process of determining if the new standard will impact the timing of revenue recognition.  3. Landfill Liabilities Liabilities for final closure and post-closure costs for the year ended December31, 2016 and for the six months ended  June30, 2017 are shown in the table below:  4. Loss Per Share  The following table sets forth the computation of basic loss per share and loss per share, assuming dilution: Basic net loss per share is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for each of the periods presented. Net loss per share, assuming dilution, is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock equivalents outstanding adjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of potentially dilutive instruments. The Company's potentially dilutive instruments are made up of equity awards, which include stock options, restricted stock awards, and performance stock awards.  10  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data) Pursuant to the FASB's Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, the Company includes additional shares in the computation of net income per share, assuming dilution. The additional shares that would be included in diluted net income per share would represent the number of shares that would be issued if all of the above potentially dilutive instruments were converted into common stock. When calculating diluted net income per share, the ASC requires the Company to include the potential shares that would be outstanding if all outstanding stock options were exercised. This number is different from outstanding stock options because it is offset by shares the Company could repurchase using the proceeds from these hypothetical exercises to obtain the common stock equivalent. Approximately 4.6 million and 0.4 million of outstanding stock awards were excluded from the diluted (loss) income per share calculation for the three months ended June30, 2017 and June30, 2016 , respectively, because their effect was antidilutive. Approximately 4.2 million and 2.2 million of outstanding stock awards were excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation for the six months ended June30, 2017 and June30, 2016 , respectively, because their effect was antidilutive.  5. Debt The following table summarizes the major components of debt at each balance sheet date and provides the maturities and interest rate ranges of each major category of debt:  All borrowings under the Term Loan B and the Revolver are guaranteed by each of the Company's current and future U.S. subsidiaries (which also guarantee the Senior Notes), subject to certain agreed-upon exemptions. All guarantors are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally liable. There are no significant restrictions on the Company or any guarantor to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan.  Revolver and Letter of Credit Facilities  As of June30, 2017 , the Company had an aggregate committed capacity of $300.0 , of which $100.0 was available for letters of credit under its credit facilities. The Company's Revolver is its primary source of letter of credit capacity and expires in 2021. As of June30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had $5.0 and $0.0 of borrowings outstanding on the Revolver, respectively. As of June30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had an aggregate of $40.9 and $42.1 , respectively, of letters of credit outstanding under its credit facilities.         11  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data) 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The following table summarizes the fair values of derivative instruments recorded in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets: The Company has not offset fair value of assets and liabilities recognized for its derivative instruments. Interest Rate Caps In December 2012, the Company entered into four interest rate cap agreements to hedge the risk of a rise in interest rates and associated cash flows on its variable rate debt. The interest rate caps expired in various tranches through fiscal 2016. The Company recorded a premium of $5.0 in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and amortized the premium to interest expense based upon decreases in the time value of the caps. Amortization expense was approximately $0.0 and $0.2 for the three and six months ending June 30, 2016 , respectively. In May 2016, the Company entered into three interest rate cap agreements as economic hedges against the risk of a rise in interest rates and the associated cash flows on its variable rate debt. The Company is paying the $5.5 premium of the caps equally over eleven quarters beginning on March 31, 2017. The Company elected not to apply hedge accounting to these interest rate caps therefore changes in the fair value of the interest rate caps are recorded in other (expense) income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded a loss of $2.0 and $2.8 for the three months ending June30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively and $3.3 and $2.8 for the six months ended  June30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Of the recorded losses, $0.5 and $1.0 for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 , respectively, were realized losses. The notional value of the contracts aggregated were $800.0 as of June30, 2017 and will remain constant through maturity in September 2019. Commodity Futures Contracts Prior to fiscal 2017, the company utilized fuel derivative instruments (commodity futures contracts) as economic hedges of the risk that fuel prices would fluctuate. The Company has used financial derivative instruments for both short-term and long-term time frames and utilized fixed price swap agreements to manage the identified risk. The Company does not currently have plans to enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All fuel derivative contracts entered into by the Company expired prior to fiscal 2017. Changes in the fair value and settlements of the fuel derivative instruments were recorded in other (expense) income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded income of $2.1 and $1.5 , respectively, for the three and six months ended  June30, 2016 .  7. Income Taxes  The Company's effective income tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 was 33.3% and 90.5% , respectively. The Company evaluates its effective income tax rate at each interim period and adjusts it accordingly as facts and circumstances warrant. The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2017 is materially consistent with the federal statutory rate of 35% . The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of permanently non-deductible expenses included in stock-based compensation. These items had a greater impact on the Company's effective income tax rate during the three months ended June 30, 2016 than in comparable prior periods due to the Company's pre-tax earnings being near break-even for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The Company's effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 was 40.0% and 26.7% , respectively. The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was primarily due to the favorable impact of recorded valuation allowance and the favorable 12  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data) impact of state and local taxes. The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of permanently non-deductible expenses and the unfavorable impact of a change in recorded valuation allowance.  As of June30, 2017 , the Company had $10.5 of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. These liabilities are primarily included as a component of long-term "Other liabilities" in the condensed consolidated balance sheet because the Company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate when it would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but the Company does not believe that the ultimate settlement of its obligations will materially affect its liquidity.  8. Commitments and Contingencies Financial Instruments The Company has obtained letters of credit, performance bonds and insurance policies for the performance of landfill final capping, closure and post-closure requirements, environmental remediation, and other obligations. Letters of credit are supported by the Company's Revolver (Note 5). The Company does not expect that any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company has not experienced any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining the required financial assurance instruments for its current operations. In an ongoing effort to mitigate risks of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity, the Company continues to evaluate various options to access cost-effective sources of financial assurance. Insurance The Company carries insurance coverage for protection of its assets and operations from certain risks including automobile liability, general liability, real and personal property, workers' compensation, directors and officers liability, pollution, legal liability and other coverages the Company believes are customary to the industry. The Company's exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per incident deductible, or self-insured retention, under the related insurance policy. Its exposure, however, could increase if its insurers are unable to meet their commitments on a timely basis. The Company has retained a significant portion of the risks related to its automobile, general liability, workers' compensation and health claims programs. For its self-insured retentions, the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, is based on an actuarial valuation and internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from the Company's assumptions used. The Company does not expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Litigation and Other Matters In February 2009, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries were named as defendants in a purported class action suit in the Circuit Court of Macon County, Alabama. Similar class action complaints were brought against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries in 2011 in Duval County, Florida and in 2013 in Quitman County, Georgia and Barbour County, Alabama, and in 2014 in Chester County, Pennsylvania. The 2013 Georgia complaint was dismissed in March 2014. In late 2015 in Gwinnett County, Georgia, another purported class action suit was filed. The plaintiffs in those cases primarily allege that the defendants charged improper fees (fuel, administrative and environmental fees) that were in breach of the plaintiffs' service agreements with the Company and seek damages in an unspecified amount. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses against these purported class actions, which it will vigorously pursue. Given the inherent uncertainties of litigation, including the early stage of these cases, the unknown size of any potential class, and legal and factual issues in dispute, the outcome of these cases cannot be predicted and a range of loss, if any, cannot currently be estimated. In November 2014, the Attorney General of the State of Vermont filed a complaint against the Company relating to the Moretown, Vermont landfill regarding alleged odor and other environmental-related noncompliances with environmental laws and regulations and environmental permits. In the complaint, the Attorney General requested that the State of Vermont Superior Court find the Company liable for the alleged noncompliances, issue related civil penalties, and order the Company to reimburse the State of Vermont for enforcement costs. While the complaint does not specify a monetary penalty, prior 13  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data) correspondence from the Attorney General of the State of Vermont indicates that it may seek a penalty relating to the alleged noncompliances that is not expected to be material. Given the inherent uncertainties of litigation, including the early stage of this case, the outcome cannot be predicted and a range of loss, if any, cannot currently be estimated.  In February 2017, a waste slide occurred in one cell at the Company's Greentree Landfill in Kersey, Pennsylvania.During the six months ended June30, 2017 , the Company recorded a charge in operating expenses of $5.4 , representing the Company's current estimate of probable costs to relocate displaced material and restore infrastructure, net of estimated insurance recoveries; this amount could increase or decrease as a result of actual costs incurred to completion and insurance recoveries. The Company has incurred $2.4 and $3.9 for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 , respectively. The Company is subject to various other proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims and regulatory investigations arising in the ordinary course of its business. Many of these actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against the Company include commercial, customer, and employment-related claims. The plaintiffs in some actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. These actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. Although the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome and the range of loss cannot be currently estimated, the Company does not believe that the eventual outcome of any such action could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  Multiemployer Defined Benefit Pension Plans Approximately 12.7% of the Company's workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements with various local unions across its operating regions. As a result of some of these agreements, certain of the Company's subsidiaries are participating employers in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer, defined benefit pension plans for the affected employees. In connection with its ongoing renegotiation of various collective bargaining agreements, the Company may discuss and negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans. A complete or partial withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan may also occur if employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement vote to decertify a union from continuing to represent them. The Company is not aware of any such actions in connection with continuing operations. As a result of certain discontinued operations, the Company is potentially exposed to certain withdrawal liabilities. The Company does not believe that any future withdrawals, individually or in the aggregate, from the multiemployer plans to which it contributes could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or liquidity. However, such withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations for a particular reporting period, depending on the number of employees withdrawn in any future period and the financial condition of the multiemployer plan(s) at the time of such withdrawal(s).  Tax Matters  The Company has open tax years dating back to 2000 in certain jurisdictions. Prior to the acquisition, MW Star Holdings, Corp. (Veolia ES Solid Waste division) was part of a consolidated group and is still subject to IRS and state examinations dating back to 2004. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition of Veolia ES Solid Waste, Inc., the Company is entitled to certain indemnifications for Veolia ES Solid Waste Division's pre-acquisition tax liabilities. The Company maintains a liability for uncertain tax positions, the balance of which management believes is adequate. Results of audit assessments by taxing authorities are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.  9. Segment and Related Information The Company manages and evaluates its operations primarily through its South, East and Midwest regional segments. These three groups are presented below as the Company's reportable segments. The Company's three geographic operating segments provide collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services. The Company serves residential, commercial and industrial, and municipal customers throughout its operating segments. As disclosed in the Company's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company reorganized its internal structure during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 by moving two business units from the East segment to the South segment. Segment revenue, operating income and depreciation and amortization for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 have been reclassified to reflect these changes to the Company's operating segments. As a result, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, $5.7 of segment revenue was reclassified from the East to the South, $1.0 of operating income was reclassified from the East to the South and $0.3 of depreciation and amortization was reclassified from the East to the South. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, $11.1 of segment revenue was reclassified from the East to the South, $1.8  14  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data) of operating income was reclassified from the East to the South and $0.8 of depreciation and amortization was reclassified from the East to the South. Revenues, operating income/(loss) and depreciation and amortization for our reportable segments for the periods indicated, are shown in the following tables:  Fluctuations in the Company's operating results may be caused by many factors, including period-to-period changes in the relative contribution of revenue by each line of business and operating segment and by general economic conditions. In addition, its revenues and income from operations typically reflect seasonal patterns. The Company expects its operating results to vary seasonally, with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter, higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters. This seasonality reflects the lower volume of solid waste generated during the late fall, winter and early spring in the East and Midwest segments because of decreased construction and demolition activities during winter months in these regions of the United States. In addition, some of the Company's operating costs may be higher in the winter months. Adverse winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities, resulting in higher labor and operational costs. Greater precipitation in the winter increases the weight of collected municipal solid waste, resulting in higher disposal costs, which are calculated on a per ton basis. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as hurricanes that most often impact the South region, can increase the Company's revenues in the areas affected. While weather-related and other 15  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data) occurrences can boost revenues through additional work, as a result of significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue sometimes generates earnings at comparatively lower margins. Certain weather conditions, including severe winter storms, may result in the temporary suspension of the Company's operations, which can significantly affect the operating results of the affected regions. No such events have occurred during the periods presented.  10. Fair Value Measurements Assets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value In measuring fair values of assets and liabilities, the Company uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs (Level 1) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs (Level 3). The Company also uses market data or assumptions that it believes market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk when appropriate. The carrying value for certain of the Company's financial instruments approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. The Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following: The fair value of the interest rate caps are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about interest rates based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in fair value hierarchy). Fair Value of Debt The fair value of the Company's debt (Level 2) is estimated using indirectly observable market inputs, except for the Revolver for which cost approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the interest rate. Although the Company has determined the estimated fair value amounts using quoted market prices, considerable judgment is required in interpreting the information and in developing the estimated fair values. Therefore, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company, or holders of the instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. The fair value estimates are based on information available as of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 , respectively. 16  Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data) The estimated fair value of the Company's debt is as follows: The carrying value of the Company's debt at June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 was $1,897.5 and $1,905.0 , respectively.  11. Acquisitions Eight acquisitions were completed during the six months ended June 30, 2017 for aggregate consideration consisting of a cash purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $84.3 and notes payable of $1.6 , subject to net working capital adjustments and other commitments, which are expected to be completed within approximately one year. The goodwill recognized of $25.4 represents long-term growth potential and the synergies from the combined operations of the acquired entities and the Company. The Company is still reviewing information surrounding property and equipment, intangible assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities resulting from the acquisitions, which may result in changes to the Company's preliminary purchase price allocation during subsequent periods. Transaction costs related to these acquisitions were not significant for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 . The results of operations of each acquisition are included in the consolidated statements of operations of the Company subsequent to the closing date of each acquisition.  The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired, net of cash acquired, year to date as of: The following table presents the allocation of the purchase price to other intangible assets: The amount of goodwill recorded related to these acquisitions for the South Segment, East Segment, and Midwest Segment was $0.8 , $24.6 , and $0.0 , respectively. The amount of goodwill deductible for tax purposes related to these acquisitions is $0.9 . The weighted average life of other intangible assets in years is as follows:   17 Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions, except share data)  12. Subsequent Events  Acquisitions  During July 2017, the Company completed two acquisitions of waste collection companies. The Company paid consideration of $20.0 for these acquisitions. The Company has not yet completed its initial purchase price allocation.  Asset Purchase  On May 1, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to lease a 22,500 square foot building and related improvements near Orlando, FL. In June 2017, the Lessor communicated their intention to sell the facility. The Company has exercised its right of first offer pursuant to the lease agreement and is in process of finalizing the agreement to purchase the leased assets for cash consideration of $8.5 .   18    
Item2. Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included under Item1. In addition, you should refer to our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations appearing in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. All dollar amounts are presented in millions, unless otherwise stated. Overview We are a leading integrated provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services, operating primarily in secondary markets or under exclusive arrangements. We have a presence in 16 states across the Midwest, South and East regions of the United States, serving approximately 2.8 million residential and over 200,000 commercial and industrial (C&I) customers through our extensive network of 91 collection operations, 73 transfer stations, 22 owned or operated recycling facilities and 40 owned or operated landfills. We operate 5 landfill gas and renewable energy projects and have an additional 12 third party owned landfill gas and renewable energy projects. We also have post-closure responsibility for 5 closed landfills. We seek to drive financial performance in markets in which we own or operate a landfill or in certain disposal-neutral markets, where the landfill is owned by our municipal customer. In markets in which we own or operate a landfill, we aim to create and maintain vertically integrated operations through which we manage a majority of our customers' waste from the point of collection through the point of disposal, a process we refer to as internalization. By internalizing a majority of the waste in these markets, we are able to deliver high quality customer service while also ensuring a stable revenue stream and maximizing profitability and cash flow from operations. In disposal-neutral markets, we focus selectively on opportunities where we can negotiate exclusive arrangements with our municipal customers, facilitating highly efficient and profitable collection operations with lower capital requirements. Geographically, we focus our business principally in secondary, or less densely populated non-urban, markets where the presence of large national providers is generally more limited. We also compete selectively in primary, or densely populated urban, markets where we can capitalize on opportunities for vertical integration through our high-quality transfer and disposal infrastructure and where we can benefit from highly efficient collection route density. We maintain an attractive mix of revenue from varying sources, including residential collections, C&I collections, landfill gas and special waste streams, and fees charged to third parties for disposal in our network of transfer stations and landfills. Results of Operations The following table sets forth for the periods indicated our consolidated results of operations and the percentage relationship that certain items from our condensed consolidated financial statements bear to revenue (in millions and as a percentage of our revenue).   19   Three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2016 Operating income decreased  $12.0 or 33.2% to $24.1 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 . The decrease was primarily the result of the following:   As discussed in Note 2 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of$13.0during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating income, net of the $13.0 million impairment described above, increased $1.0 or 2.8% to $37.1 for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily the result of the following:   An increase in service revenues of $24.9 as detailed further in the "Revenue" section below. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was partially offset by the following:   An increase in operating costs of $21.1 which includes higher disposal and transportation costs of $8.5 to support the increase in our service revenue, an increase in salary and wage expense of $4.4 due to merit increases, acquisition activity, higher healthcare costs and higher workers' compensation cost, an increase in fuel expense of $2.1 due to the increase in diesel fuel prices, an increase in maintenance costs for landfill gas control, leachate and sulfate treatment of $1.8, an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of $1.6 due to acquisition activity, an increase in sales and marketing expense of $1.2 due to hiring additional sales representatives and an increase in insurance expenses of $0.6 due to higher automobile and property insurance costs.   An increase in depreciation and amortization of $2.9 as a result of acquisition activity. Six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2016 Operating income decreased $13.7 or 27.9% to $35.4 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Operating income, net of the $13.0 intangible asset impairment and $5.4 of costs associated with the Greentree landfill waste slide, increased $4.7 or 9.6% to $53.8 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily the result of the following:   An increase in service revenues of $38.5 as detailed further in the "Revenue" section below. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was partially offset by the following:   An increase in operating costs of $31.4, net of the $5.4 in costs associated with the Greentree landfill waste slide, which includes higher disposal and transportation costs of $10.2 to support the increase in our service revenue, an increase in salary and wage expense of $6.7 due to merit increases, acquisition activity, higher healthcare costs and higher workers' compensation cost, an increase in fuel expense of $5.7 due to the increase in diesel fuel prices, an increase in maintenance costs for landfill gas control, leachate and sulfate treatment of $2.7, an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of $2.7 due to acquisition activity, an increase in sales and marketing expense of $1.7 due to hiring additional sales representatives and an increase in insurance expenses of $1.3 due to higher automobile and property insurance costs;   An increase in depreciation and amortization of $3.5 as a result of acquisition activity. Revenue  Through our subsidiaries, we generate revenue primarily by providing collection and disposal services to commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. Our remaining revenue is generated from recycling, fuel and environmental fees, landfill gas-to-energy operations and other ancillary revenue-generating activities. Revenues from our collection operations consist of fees we receive from municipal, subscription, residential and C&I customers and are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the recycling, transfer station or disposal facilities and our disposal costs. Standard C&I service agreements are typically three to five years, and we have historically maintained strong relationships with our C&I customers. Our municipal customer relationships are generally supported by exclusive contracts ranging from three to ten years in initial duration with subsequent renewal periods. Certain municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as the consumer price index (CPI). We provide commercial front load and temporary and permanent rolloff service 20   offerings to our commercial customers. While the majority of our rolloff services are provided to customers under long-term service agreements, we generally do not enter into contracts with our temporary rolloff customers due to the relatively short-term nature of most construction and demolition (C&D) projects.  Our transfer stations and landfills generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of fees which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue consists of disposal or tipping fees and proceeds from the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties.  The amounts charged for collection, disposal, and recycling services may include fuel fees and environmental fees. Fuel fees and environmental fees are not designed to be specific to the direct costs and expenses to service an individual customer's account, but rather are designed to address and to help recover changes in our overall cost structure and to achieve an operating margin acceptable to us.  Other revenue is comprised of ancillary revenue-generating activities, such as trucking, landfill gas-to-energy operations at municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills, management of third-party owned landfills, customer service charges relating to overdue payments and customer administrative fees relating to customers who request paper copies of invoices rather than opting for electronic invoices. The following table sets forth our consolidated revenues by line of business for the periods indicated (in millions and as a percentage of total service revenues).  The following table reflects changes in components of our revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016: Average yield is defined as aggregate contribution of price changes excluding recycled commodities and fuel fee revenue. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we experienced the following changes in components of our revenue as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016: 21     Average yield increased revenue by 1.4% driven by positive open market price yield in our commercial and roll-off collection lines of business along with higher price yield in our municipal residential business due to the positive impact of higher CPI contract resets but offset somewhat from lower C&D pricing;   Recycling revenue increased revenue by 1.2% due to an increase in recycling commodity prices;   Fuel fee revenue increased revenue by 0.5%. These fees fluctuate in response to changes in prices for diesel fuel on which the surcharge is based and, consequently, any increase in fuel prices results in an increase in our revenue. Our fuel surcharge fees reset on a monthly basis therefore an increase in our fuel fee revenue is delayed in comparison to the increase in our fuel expense when diesel fuel prices increase;   Organic volume increased revenue by 0.6% primarily due to an increase in landfill disposal volumes and an increase in third party trucking revenue due to special waste project activity. Volumes in the commercial and rolloff collection business were flat with residential volume decreasing as we continue to cycle through certain municipal contract losses and contract losses from our business rationalization strategy;   Acquisitions increased revenue by 3.4% due to our execution of acquisition opportunities that further enhance our vertical integration strategy;   Divestitures decreased revenue by 0.1% due to our strategic decisions to divest low margin businesses in fiscal 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we experienced the following changes in components of our revenue as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016:   Average yield increased revenue by 2.0% as we achieved positive open market price yield in our collection and disposal operations and higher price yield in our municipal residential business due to the positive impact of higher CPI contract resets. Average yield in our disposal business increased with price growth for MSW and special waste volumes partially offset by lower prices for C&D volumes due in part to mix changes;   Recycling revenue increased revenue by 1.3% due to an increase in recycling commodity prices;   Fuel fee revenue increased revenue by 0.4%. These fees fluctuate in response to changes in prices for diesel fuel on which the surcharge is based and, consequently, any increase in fuel prices results in an increase in our revenue. Our fuel surcharge fees reset on a monthly basis therefore an increase in our fuel fee revenue is delayed in comparison to the increase in our fuel expense when diesel fuel prices increase;   Organic volume decreased revenue by 0.5% primarily due to a decrease in residential collection volumes as we continue to cycle through certain municipal contract losses and contract losses from our business rationalization strategy and a reduction in shale related volumes. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in C&D disposal volumes and an increase in third party trucking revenue due to special waste project activity;   Acquisitions increased revenue by 2.6% due to our execution of acquisition opportunities that further enhance our vertical integration strategy;   Divestitures decreased revenue by 0.2% due to our strategic decisions to divest low margin businesses in fiscal 2016.  Operating Expenses The following table summarizes our operating expenses (in millions and as a percentage of our revenue):    22   Our operating expenses include the following:    Labor and related benefits, which consist of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits, incentive compensation and payroll taxes;    Transfer and disposal costs which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations as well as transportation and subcontractor costs (which include costs for independent haulers who transport waste from transfer stations to our disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with markets outside our standard operating areas);    Maintenance and repairs expenses which include labor, maintenance and repairs to our vehicles, equipment and containers;    Fuel costs which include the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of fuel tax credits;    Franchise fees and taxes which consist of municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties;    Risk management expenses which include casualty insurance premiums, claims payments, estimates for claims incurred but not reported and casualty losses;    Other expenses which include expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent, leachate and sulfate treatment and disposal, and other landfill maintenance costs;    Accretion expense related to landfill capping, closure and post-closure is included in operating expenses in our condensed consolidated statement of operations, but, it is excluded from the table below (refer to "Accretion of Landfill Retirement Obligations" for a detailed discussion of the changes in amounts).  The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, excluding accretion expense on our landfill retirement obligations (in millions and as a percentage of our revenue): The cost categories shown above may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. Thus, you should exercise caution when comparing our operating expenses by cost component to that of other companies. Three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2016 Operating expenses increased by $20.6 or 9.5% to $236.4 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from $215.8 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 . The change reflects the following:  23     Labor and related benefits increased by $4.5 or 6.2% to $77.6 which was primarily attributable to merit increases, acquisition activity, higher health care costs due to an increase in the severity and frequency of medical claims and higher workers' compensation costs due to less favorable actuarial development;    Transfer and disposal costs increased by $6.1 or 12.7% to $54.1 as a result of increased disposal volumes, acquisition activity, increased third party trucking costs, increased container weights and higher recycling rebates due to the increase in recycling commodity prices;    Maintenance and repairs expense increased by $1.6 or 4.8% to $34.7 . The increase was driven by increased labor costs primarily attributable to merit increases, acquisition activity and higher health care costs;    Fuel costs increased  $2.1 or 15.0% to $16.1 primarily resulting from increases in diesel fuel prices and the expiration of certain natural gas fuel excise tax credits as of December 31, 2016;    Franchise fees and taxes increased $1.1 or 6.5% to $18.1 primarily due to changes in the mix of waste in the South segment;    Risk management expense increased $0.8 or 11.6% to $7.7 primarily due to higher automobile and property insurance costs and less favorable actuarial development;    Other operating costs increased  $4.4 or 18.6% to $28.1 due to an increase in maintenance costs related to landfill gas control, leachate and sulfate treatment and increased costs to operate an asphalt plant associated with a recent acquisition. Six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2016 Operating expenses increased by $35.9 or 8.4% to $461.7 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 from $425.8 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The change reflects the following:    Labor and related benefits increased by $6.7 or 4.6% to $153.0 which was primarily attributable to merit increases, acquisition activity, higher health care costs due to an increase in the severity and frequency of medical claims and higher workers' compensation costs;    Transfer and disposal costs increased by $8.1 or 8.7% to $101.7 as a result of increased disposal volumes, acquisition activity, increased third party trucking costs, increased container weights and higher recycling rebates due to the increase in recycling commodity prices;    Maintenance and repairs expense increased by $2.5 or 3.8% to $67.9. The increase was driven by increased labor costs primarily attributable to merit increases, acquisition activity and higher health care costs;    Fuel costs increased $5.7 or 21.8% to $31.9 primarily resulting from increases in diesel fuel prices and the expiration of certain natural gas fuel excise tax credits as of December 31, 2016;    Franchise fees and taxes increased $0.8 or 2.5% to $32.4 primarily due to changes in the mix of waste in the South segment;    Risk management expense increased $1.5 or 9.8% to $16.8 primarily due to higher automobile and property insurance costs and less favorable actuarial development;    Other operating costs increased $5.0 or 10.5% to $52.6 primarily due to an increase in maintenance costs related to a landfill gas control system and increased costs to operate an asphalt plant associated with a recent acquisition;    We recorded $5.4 of costs, net of estimated insurance recoveries, associated with the Greentree landfill waste slide. Accretion of Landfill Retirement Obligations Accretion expense was $3.8 and $3.3 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase of $0.5 was primarily attributable to the assumption of post-closure responsibility at one of our landfills during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and the acquisition of a landfill during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Accretion expense was $7.4 and $6.5 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase of $0.9 was primarily attributable to the assumption of post-closure responsibility at one of our landfills during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and the acquisition of a landfill during the 24   first quarter of fiscal 2017. For a discussion of factors affecting capping obligations, see the critical accounting policies in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, legal and professional fees and other expenses. Salaries expenses include salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management, field support functions, sales force, accounting and finance, legal, management information systems, and clerical and administrative departments. Other expenses include rent and office costs, fees for professional services provided by third parties, marketing, directors' and officers' insurance, general employee relocation, travel, entertainment and bank charges, but exclude any such amounts recorded as restructuring charges. The following table provides the components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated (in millions and as a percentage of our revenue):   Three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2016   Our salaries expenses decreased by $0.2 or 0.8% to $25.5 primarily due to a reduction in bonus accruals of $1.4 and a decrease in stock based compensation expense of $0.8. Stock based compensation expense decreased as our annual stock options were issued during the first quarter in fiscal 2017 compared to the second quarter in fiscal 2016 and these options vest 20% on the date of grant resulting in 20% of stock compensation expense being recorded on the date of grant. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in wages and benefits of $2.1 primarily due to merit increases and higher severance expense.   Legal and professional fees increased  $0.4 or 17.4% to $2.7 primarily due to an increase in professional fees associated with internal projects.   Other selling, general and administrative expenses increased  $1.2 or 10.7% to $12.4 primarily due to increased bad debt expense, increased software maintenance cost and increased bank processing charges. Six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2016   Our salaries expenses increased by $4.2 or 8.3% to $55.0 primarily attributable to a $3.0 increase in stock based compensation expense due to our compensation structure shifting more towards equity based compensation and the impact of initial public offering related awards and an increase in wages and benefits of $3.0 as a result of merit increases, higher severance expense and higher healthcare costs. These increases were partially offset by lower bonus accruals of $1.8.   Legal and professional fees decreased $6.2 or 51.2% to $5.9 primarily due to $7.1 of expenses incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016 related to the launch of the initial public offering process that was not completed that did not recur in the six months ended June 30, 2017. This decrease was partially offset by $0.7 of costs associated with being a public company.   Other selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3.6 or 17.0% to $24.8 primarily due to increased bad debt expense, increased software maintenance cost, increased bank processing charges and various other costs.   25   Depreciation and Amortization The following table summarizes the components of depreciation and amortization expense by asset type (in millions and as a percentage of our revenue). For a detailed discussion of depreciation and amortization by asset type refer to the discussion included in the following two sections herein. Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment Depreciation, amortization and depletion expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight-line method, and amortization and depletion of landfill airspace assets under the units-of-consumption method. Refer to the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our accounting policies. The following table summarizes depreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the periods indicated (in millions and as a percentage of our revenue):  Three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2016   Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased $2.6 or 8.2% to $33.4 due mainly to acquisition activity.   Landfill depletion and amortization increased  $1.8 or 8.2% to $23.7 due to acquisition activity.  Six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2016   Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased $2.5 or 3.9% to $65.9 due mainly to acquisition activity.   Landfill depletion and amortization increased $1.9 or 4.7% to $42.2 due to acquisition activity. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Amortization of other intangible assets was $10.4 and $10.9 or as a percentage of revenue, 2.7% and 3.0% , for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in amortization expense is attributable to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized partially offset by increased acquisition activity in the current year. Amortization of other intangible assets was $20.8 and $21.7 or as a percentage of revenue, 2.8% and 3.1%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, 26   respectively. The decrease in amortization expense is attributable to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized partially offset by increased acquisition activity in the current year. Acquisitions and Divestitures In the ordinary course of our business, we regularly evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that further enhance our vertical integration strategy. We also regularly evaluate our current operations and consider divesting of those operations that do not provide us with an acceptable profit margin.  We completed eight acquisitions during the six months ended June 30, 2017 for a cash purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $84.3 and notes payable of $1.6, subject to net working capital adjustments, which we expect to be completed within approximately one year. Six acquisitions were completed during the six months ended June 30, 2016 for a cash purchase price of $4.9 and notes payable of $0.3. The results of operations of each acquisition are included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations subsequent to the closing date of each acquisition.  During the three and six months ended June30, 2017 , we divested of our collection services operation in Charlotte, North Carolina for consideration received of $8.7 . A $1.4 gain on the sale of that business is included in our statements of operations for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 . Intangible Asset Impairment The Company has collection operations in South Carolina which operated in a competitor-owned disposal market that does not align with the Company's long-term market strategy of vertically integrated operations with Company owned disposal sites or marketplace neutral disposal sites. During April of fiscal 2017, changes in facts and circumstances led the Company to evaluate the long-term market for South Carolina collection operations and re-evaluate the expected cash flows provided by this market. The Company determined it appropriate to impair certain intangible assets that were recorded as part of the purchase accounting when these entities were acquired. Based on the Company's evaluation, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment of $13.0 during the second quarter of 2017.  Other, Net Changes in the fair value and settlements of derivative instruments are recorded in other (expense) income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and amounted to losses of $2.0 and $0.7 for the three months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changes in the fair value and settlements of derivative instruments amounted to losses of $3.3 and $1.3 for the six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Income from equity investee for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively was $0.2 and $0.5. Income from equity investee for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively was $0.6 and $1.1.  Interest Expense Interest expense decreased by $11.1 or 32.4% to $23.1 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from $34.2 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Interest expense decreased by $23.0 or 33.5% to $45.6 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 from $68.6 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decreases were due to the benefit from lower debt levels as a result of paying down debt with our initial public offering proceeds and lower interest rates due to refinancing our debt structure in November of fiscal 2016. See Note 12, Long Term Debt, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our debt refinancing. Cash paid for interest was $27.6 and $40.4 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash paid for interest was $42.4 and $58.2 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Income Taxes The Company's effective income tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 was 33.3% and 90.5%, respectively. We evaluate our effective income tax rate at each interim period and adjust it accordingly as facts and circumstances warrant. The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2017 is materially consistent with the federal statutory rate of 35%. The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of permanently non-deductible 27   expenses included in stock based compensation. These items had a greater impact on the Company's effective income tax rate during the three months ended June 30, 2016 than in comparable prior periods due to the Company's pre-tax earnings being near break-even for the three month period ending June 30, 2016. The Company's effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 was 40.0% and 26.7%, respectively. The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was primarily due to the favorable impact of recorded valuation allowance and the favorable impact of state and local taxes. The difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate of 35% and reported income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the change in recorded valuation allowance. Cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $0.3 and $1.2 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $0.6 and $1.3 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.                                28   Reportable Segments Our operations are managed through three geographic regions (South, East and Midwest) that we designate as our reportable segments. As disclosed in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we reorganized our internal structure during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 by moving two business units from the East segment to the South segment. Segment revenue, operating income and depreciation and amortization for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 have been reclassified to reflect these changes to our operating segments. As a result, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, $5.7 of segment revenue was reclassified from the East to the South, $1.0 of operating income was reclassified from the East to the South and $0.3 of depreciation and amortization was reclassified from the East to the South. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, $11.1 of segment revenue was reclassified from the East to the South, $1.8 of operating income was reclassified from the East to the South and $0.8 of depreciation and amortization was reclassified from the East to the South. Revenues, operating income/(loss) and depreciation and amortization for our reportable segments for the periods indicated, are shown in the following tables:    29   Comparison of Reportable Segments- Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2016  South Segment Revenue increased  $9.8 or 7.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 . The increase in revenue was due to an increase in acquisition related revenue of $3.0, an increase in prices in our collection operations of $2.6, an increase in volumes in our landfill disposal operations of $1.7, an increase in revenue from transfer station disposal operations of $1.7 and an increase in environmental fees of $0.8 due to a rate increase that went into effect in July of 2016.  Operating income from our South Segment increased by $1.0 or 4.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 . The increase was primarily due to the revenue increase as described above. The increase was partially offset by an increase in disposal and transportation costs of $3.6 to support the increase in our service revenue, an increase in salary and wages of $1.7 due to merit increases, higher healthcare costs and higher workers' compensation costs, an increase in fuel costs of $1.0 due to an increase in diesel fuel prices, an increase in depletion expense of $0.8 due to increased disposal volumes, an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of $0.5 due to acquisition activity and an increase in insurance expenses of $0.5 due to higher automobile and property insurance costs. East Segment Revenue increased by $9.7 , or 10.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in acquisition related revenue of $9.0, an increase in third party trucking revenue of $2.0 due to special waste project activity, an increase in special waste volumes of $0.9, an increase in residential and rolloff collection volumes of $0.9 and an increase in recycling revenue of $0.5 due to an increase in recycling commodity prices. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in shale related revenue of $1.7, a decrease in MSW disposal volumes of $1.7 and a decrease in prices in our collection operations of $0.8. Operating income from our East Segment decreased $13.5 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 . Operating income from our East Segment, net of the $13.0 South Carolina intangible asset impairment, decreased $0.5 or 6.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in disposal and transportation costs of $2.8 to support the increase in our service revenue, an increase in salary and wages of $2.3 due to merit increases, higher healthcare costs and higher workers' compensation costs, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.7 due to acquisition activity, an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of $0.9 due to acquisition activity and an increase in fuel expense of $0.8 due to an increase in diesel fuel prices. The decrease was partially offset by the increase to revenue as described above.  Midwest Segment Revenue increased  $5.4 or 3.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in recycling revenue of $3.2 due to an increase in recycling commodity prices, higher C&D disposal volumes of $1.6, an increase in environmental fees of $1.2 due to a rate increase that went into effect in July of fiscal 2016, higher prices in our collection operations of $0.9 and an increase in fuel surcharge revenue of $0.8 due to the increase in diesel fuel prices. The increases were partially offset by a reduction in residential revenue of $2.6 due to the loss of municipal contracts in fiscal 2016. Operating income from our Midwest Segment increased by $0.1 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 . The revenue increase of $5.4 above was partially offset by higher disposal and transportation cost of $2.1 to support the increase in our service revenue, an increase in maintenance costs of $1.0 related to landfill gas control, leachate and sulfate treatment, higher salary and wages of $0.4 due to merit increases and higher healthcare costs and higher depletion expense of $0.4 due to increased disposal volumes. Corporate Operating loss decreased  $0.4 or 2.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation expense of $0.8. 30   Comparison of Reportable Segments-Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 South Segment Revenue increased $16.7 or 6.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in revenue was due to an increase in acquisition related revenue of $4.8, an increase in prices in our collection operations of $5.0, an increase in revenue from transfer station disposal operations of $2.9, an increase in environmental fees of $1.9 due to a rate increase that went into effect in July of 2016, an increase in MSW disposal volume of $1.7 and an increase fuel surcharge revenue of $1.0 due to the increase in diesel fuel prices.  Operating income from our South Segment increased by $2.5 or 5.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue as described above partially offset by an increase in disposal and transportation costs of $5.4 to support the increase in our service revenue, an increase in salary and wages of $3.3 due to merit increases, higher healthcare costs and higher workers' compensation costs, an increase in fuel costs of $2.6 due to an increase in diesel fuel prices, an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of $1.3 due to acquisition activity and an increase in depletion expense of $1.2 due to an increase in disposal volumes. East Segment Revenue increased by $12.8, or 7.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in acquisition related revenue of $13.2, an increase in third party trucking revenue of $3.6 due to special waste project activity and an increase in special waste volumes of $0.9. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in shale related revenue of $3.9, a decrease in MSW disposal volumes of $2.3 and a decrease in revenue from divestitures of $1.2. Operating income from our East Segment decreased $18.9 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. Operating income from our East Segment, net of the $13.0 South Carolina intangible asset impairment and $5.4 of costs associated with the Greentree landfill waste slide, decreased $0.5 or 4.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in salary and wages of $3.0 due to merit increases, higher healthcare costs and higher workers' compensation costs, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 due to acquisition activity, an increase in fuel costs of $1.9 due to the increase in diesel fuel prices, an increase general and administrative expenses of $1.8 due to increased bad debt expense and higher shared service center costs, an increase in disposal and transportation costs of $1.5 to support the increase in our service revenue, an increase in maintenance costs for landfill gas control, leachate and sulfate treatment of $1.3 and an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of $0.8 due to acquisition activity. The decrease was partially offset by the increase to revenue as described above.  Midwest Segment Revenue increased $9.0 or 3.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in recycling revenue of $6.2 due to an increase in recycling commodity prices, higher prices in our residential and rolloff collection operations of $3.1, an increase in environmental fees of $3.0 due to a rate increase that went into effect in July of fiscal 2016, an increase in fuel surcharge revenue of $1.5 due to the increase in diesel fuel prices and higher C&D disposal volumes of $1.4. The increases were partially offset by a reduction in residential revenue of $5.6 due to the loss of municipal contracts in fiscal 2016. Operating income from our Midwest Segment decreased by $0.1 or 0.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to higher disposal and transportation cost of $3.3 to support the increase in our service revenue, an increase in fuel expense of $1.2 due to the increase in diesel fuel prices, an increase in maintenance costs of $1.6 related to a landfill gas control system and leachate and sulfate treatment and an increase in sales and marketing expense of $0.8 due to hiring additional sales representatives. The decrease was partially offset by the increase to revenue as described above. Corporate Operating loss increased $2.8 or 7.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to expenses incurred of $7.1 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 related to the launch of the initial public 31   offering process that was not completed that did not recur in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The positive impact was partially offset by higher stock compensation expense of $3.0 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operations, bank borrowings, debt offerings and equity offerings. We intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities, together with bank borrowings, to fund purchases of property and equipment, working capital, acquisitions and debt repayments. Actual debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise. We believe that our current cash balances, cash from operating activities and funds available under our Revolver will provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due. At June30, 2017 , the Company had negative working capital which was driven by purchases of property and equipment and landfill construction and development during the six months ended June 30, 2017 as well as the use of our cash to fund acquisitions. At December 31, 2016, we had negative working capital which was driven by repayments on the Term Loan B and cash used for initial public offering costs. The Company has more than adequate availability on its Revolver to fund short term working capital requirements.  Summary of Cash and Cash Equivalents and Debt Obligations The table below presents a summary of our cash and cash equivalents and debt balances (in millions): Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following table sets forth for the periods indicated a summary of our cash flows (in millions): Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities We generated $172.8 of cash flows from operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2017 , compared with $104.4 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 . The variance was primarily due to the following:   During the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company entered into an Asset Transfer and Liability Assumption Agreement with BFI Waste Systems of North America, LLC. The Company received a cash payment of $24.0 which was recorded as an operating cash flow. In exchange for this payment, the Company assumed certain post-closure liabilities of a closed portion of a landfill and became responsible for expenditures related to a gas infrastructure system. The assumed post-closure liabilities and expenditures related to the gas infrastructure system approximate the amount of the cash payment. The payments related to the assumed post-closure liabilities and expenditures related to the gas infrastructure system will be made in future periods;   A larger increase in accounts payable of $18.1 mainly due to the timing of landfill tax payments; 32     A decrease in our net loss by $19.8, after adding back the $13.0 South Carolina intangible asset impairment, due to improved operating results;   A decrease in the fair value of derivative instruments of $2.4 compared to an increase of $7.0 in the prior year period. This is primarily due to gains related to fuel derivatives during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and losses related to interest rate caps during the six months ended June 30, 2017. Cash flows from operating activities are used to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, interest payments and debt. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities We used $154.5 of cash in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $70.8 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 , an  increase of $83.7 . The variance was primarily due to the following:   An increase of $79.2 in cash expenditures used to fund acquisitions;   Higher cash expenditures of $10.7 used to fund the purchase of property and equipment and landfill construction and development; The increase in cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was partially offset by the following:   Higher proceeds from the sale of businesses of $6.2 due to the disposition of our Charlotte, North Carolina collection operations during the six months ended June 30, 2017. Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities During the six months ended June 30, 2017 , net cash used in financing activities was $16.6 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $33.0 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 , a decrease of $16.4 . The variance was primarily due to the following:   A decrease in capital returned to the former parent of $12.6;   An decrease in net payments on debt instruments of $10.6 due to proceeds needed to fund acquisitions;   An increase in proceeds from stock option exercises of $4.7; The decrease in cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was partially offset by the following:   A decrease in bank overdrafts of $11.3. Senior Secured Credit Facilities  On November10, 2016, we entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Agreement") by and among the Company, the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders") and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent (respectively, the "Administrative Agent" and the "Collateral Agent"), pursuant to which the Credit Agreement, by and among the Company, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, among others, dated as of October9, 2012 (as amended and restated in accordance with the Amended and Restated Agreement) was amended and restated.  The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $1.5 billion Term Loan B facility maturing 2023, and a $300.0 Revolver maturing 2021 (together, our "Senior Secured Credit Facilities"). The Revolver allows for up to $100.0 million of letters of credit outstanding. At the Company's option, borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will bear interest at an alternate base rate or adjusted LIBOR rate in each case plus an applicable margin. The alternate base rate is defined as the greater of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or the adjusted LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points. The LIBOR base rate is subject to a 0.75% floor.  In the case of the Term Loan B, the applicable margin is 1.75% per annum for ABR Loans and 2.75% per annum for Eurodollar Loans. In the case of the Revolver, the applicable margin is 1.75% per annum for ABR Loans and 2.75% per annum for Eurodollar Loans if our total net leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 4.00:1.00. If our total net leverage ratio is less than 4.00:1.00, the applicable margin on the Revolver is 1.25% per annum for ABR Loans and 2.25% per annum for Eurodollar Loans.  33   Obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions) and are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all our personal property assets, and certain real property assets, including all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of our domestic subsidiaries (in each cases, subject to certain limited exceptions).  Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may be prepaid at any time without premium. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations and warranties, and usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on liens, additional indebtedness, investments, restricted payments, asset sales, mergers, affiliate transactions and other customary limitations, as well as a total net leverage ratio financial covenant (for the benefit of lenders under the Revolver only). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains usual and customary events of default, including non-payment of principal, interest, fees and other amounts, material breach of a representation or warranty, nonperformance of covenants and obligations, default on other material debt, bankruptcy or insolvency, material judgments, incurrence of certain material ERISA liabilities, impairment of loan documentation or security and change of control. Compliance with these covenants is a condition to any incremental borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans (which would adversely affect our liquidity). The Term Loan B has principal payments due quarterly of $3.75 with mandatory prepayments due to the extent net cash proceeds from the sale of assets exceed $25.0 in any fiscal year and are not reinvested in the business within 365 days from the date of sale, upon notification of our intent to take such action or in accordance with Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Further prepayments are due when there is Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  Borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities can be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2017 and December31, 2016, we had $5.0 and $0.0 in borrowings outstanding under our Revolver, respectively. As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of approximately $40.9 and $42.1 of letters of credit outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, respectively. As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had remaining capacity under our Revolver of $254.1 and $257.9, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our ability to maintain compliance with our covenants will be highly dependent on our results of operations and, to the extent necessary, our ability to implement remedial measures such as reductions in operating costs. The Revolver has an annual commitment fee equal to 0.50% per annumif the total net leverage ratio is greater than 4.00:1.00, orif otherwise, 0.375% per annum. The amount of commitment fees for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were not significant. We are subject to a maximum total net leverage ratio of 6.75:1.00. The actual total net leverage ratio at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was 4.64:1.00 and 4.76:1.00, respectively. 5.625% Senior Notes due 2024  On November10, 2016, we closed a 144A offering (the "Notes Offering") exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), of $425.0 aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2024 (the "Notes").  We issued the Notes under an indenture dated November10, 2016 (the "Indenture") among the Company, the guarantors party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.625%per year. Interest on the Notes is payable on May15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May15, 2017. The Notes mature on November15, 2024. Before November15, 2019, we may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. At any time on or after November15, 2019, we may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued interest. In addition, before November15, 2019, we may, from time to time, redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 105.625% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The redemption prices set forth in the indenture for the twelve month periods beginning on November 15 of the years indicated below are as follows: 34    The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; pay dividends (subject to certain exceptions) or make certain redemptions, repurchases or distributions or make certain other restricted payments or investments; create liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; transfer and sell assets; and create restrictions on dividends or other payments by our restricted subsidiaries. Certain covenants will cease to apply to the Notes for so long as the Notes have investment grade ratings. The Notes will be unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by all of our current and future U.S. subsidiaries that guarantee the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Indenture. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 , we had no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases, which are not classified as debt. We do not guarantee any third-party debt. Seasonality We expect our operating results to vary seasonally, with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter, higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters. This seasonality reflects the lower volume of solid waste generated during the late fall, winter and early spring in the East and Midwest segments because of decreased construction and demolition activities during winter months in these regions of the U.S. In addition, some of our operating costs may be higher in the winter months. Adverse winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities, resulting in higher labor and operational costs. Greater precipitation in the winter increases the weight of collected municipal solid waste, resulting in higher disposal costs, which are calculated on a per ton basis. Liquidity Impacts of Income Tax Items As of June30, 2017 , we have $10.5 of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest. These liabilities are primarily included as a component of other long-term liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet because the Company generally does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities, but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity.  Financial Assurance We must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping, closure and post-closure costs, and related to our performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts. We satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds and letters of credit. The amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations. The financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill. Generally, states require a third-party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping, closure and post-closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill. The amount of financial assurance required can, and generally will, differ from the obligation determined and recorded under U.S. GAAP. The amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract. Additionally, we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations. We do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements in the foreseeable future, although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change. These financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness. Because we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments, they are not reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. However, we record capping, closure and post-closure liabilities and self-insurance liabilities as they are incurred. The underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments, in excess of those already reflected in our 35   condensed consolidated balance sheets, would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations. We do not expect this to occur. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management's most subjective judgments. A summary of significant accounting policies is disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our critical accounting policies are further described under the caption "Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Recently Issued and Proposed Accounting Standards For a description of new accounting standards that may affect us, see Note 2, Basis of Presentation, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part 1 of this Form 10-Q.
