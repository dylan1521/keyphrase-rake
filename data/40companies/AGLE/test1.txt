   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as the audited consolidated financial statements and notes and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Prospectus dated April 6, 2016 filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4), which we refer to as the "Prospectus". This discussion and other parts of this Quarterly Report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section of this report entitled "Risk Factors."  Overview  We are a biotechnology company committed to developing enzyme-based therapeutics in the field of amino acid metabolism that we believe will transform the lives of patients with inborn errors of metabolism and cancer. Our engineered human enzymes are designed to reduce the level of specific amino acids in the blood. In inborn errors of metabolism, or IEM, a subset of rare genetic metabolic diseases, we are seeking to reduce the toxic levels of amino acids in patients. In oncology, we are seeking to reduce amino acid blood levels below the normal range where we believe we will be able to exploit the dependence of certain cancers on specific amino acids.  Our lead product candidate, AEB1102, is engineered to degrade the amino acid arginine and is being developed to treat two extremes of arginine metabolism, including arginine excess in patients with Arginase I deficiency, an IEM, as well as some cancers which have shown to have a metabolic dependence on arginine. AEB1102 has demonstrated the ability to reduce blood arginine levels in nonclinical and clinical studies supporting its use as a potential treatment of both Arginase I deficiency and those cancers predicted to be dependent on arginine for survival.  Since inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to identifying and developing product candidates, conducting nonclinical studies, initiating and conducting clinical trials, recruiting personnel and raising capital. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, the initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, completed on April 12, 2016, and collection of a research grant. We have no recorded revenue from product sales and all of our revenue to date has been grant revenue. Since our inception, and through March 31, 2016, we have raised an aggregate of $54.7 million to fund our operations through sale and issuance of convertible preferred and common equity securities and collected of $5.3 million in grant proceeds.  As of March 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $29.0 million. In April 2016, we completed our IPO and sold 5,481,940 shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately $47.3 million net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.  We have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $4.5 million and $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative expenses associated with our operations. As of March 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $28.1 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we continue our clinical and diagnostic development activities for our lead product candidate, AEB1102; concurrently develop our pipeline product candidates; expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.  Recent Developments  On April 12, 2016, we closed an IPO of our common stock, which resulted in the sale of 5,481,940 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $10.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions, including 481,940 shares of common stock issued upon the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds from the IPO of approximately $47.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.  16   In March 2016, our investigational new drug app lication ( IND ) for AEB1102 for t he treatment of patients with hematological malignancies was declared effective by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration  ( FDA ) . In the first half of 2016, we intend to initiate a Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AEB1102. In April 2016, our clinical trial application ( CTA ) for AEB1102 for the treatment of patients with hematological malignancies was declared effective by Health Canada , which will enable us to use clinical site s in Canada for this trial.  In January 2016, our IND application for AEB1102 for the treatment of Arginase I deficiency, a urea cycle disorder that results in elevated levels of the amino acid arginine was declared effective by the FDA. In the first half of 2016, we intend to initiate a Phase 1 dose escalation study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AEB1102 in patients with this IEM.  Components of Operating Results  Revenue  To date, we have recognized revenue solely from a research grant from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, or CPRIT, and have not generated any revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates. Our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for several years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and eventual commercialization of our product candidates.  In June 2015, we entered into a grant agreement with CPRIT for $19.8 million covering a three year period from June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2017. The grant allows us to receive funds in advance of costs and allowable expenses being incurred. We record the revenue as qualifying costs are incurred and there is reasonable assurance that the conditions of the award have been met for collection. Proceeds received prior to the costs being incurred are recognized as deferred revenue until the services are performed.  On a quarterly basis, we are required to submit a financial reporting package outlining the nature and extent of reimbursable costs paid and requesting reimbursement under the grant. At the end of each period, expenses paid prior to reimbursement result in the recognition of a grant receivable.  Research and development expenses  Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the discovery and development of our product candidates, most notably, our lead product candidate AEB1102. Since we currently do not have internal laboratory or manufacturing capabilities, we contract with external providers for nonclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing services. Our research and development costs include:              costs from acquiring clinical trial materials and services performed for contracted services with our strategic manufacturing partner;              fees paid to clinical trial sites, clinical research organizations, contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, nonclinical research companies, and academic institutions;              employee and consultant-related expenses incurred, which include salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation; and              expenses incurred under license agreements with third parties.  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods or services to be rendered in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.  Research and development costs have historically represented the largest component of our total operating expenses. We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product candidates.  17   Our expenditures on current and future nonclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates w ill depend on a variety of factors, including:              the scope, rate of progress, and expenses of our ongoing research activities as well as any additional clinical trials and other research and development activities;              future clinical trial results;              uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rates or drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;              potential safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;              significant and changing government regulation; and              the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals, if any.  The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain FDA and other regulatory approval is costly and time consuming and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. The risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report titled "Risk Factors." As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.  General and administrative expenses  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, and human resources functions. Other significant costs include legal fees relating corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services.  We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities, potential commercialization of our product candidates and the increased costs of operating as a public company. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, we expect to incur increased costs associated with being a public company, including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with NASDAQ listing rules and SEC requirements, insurance and investor relations costs.  Interest income  Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.  Income taxes  Since inception in December 2013, through March 10, 2015, we were a Delaware LLC and elected to file as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes through the year ended December 31, 2014. On March 10, 2015, we converted from a Delaware LLC to a Delaware corporation, and will file a corporate income tax return for the year ended December 31, 2015. For tax purposes, we elected to be treated as a corporation under Subchapter C of Chapter 1 of the United States Internal Revenue Code, effective January 1, 2015. We therefore, were subject to federal and state tax expense beginning January 1, 2015.  We serve as a holding company for our seven wholly-owned subsidiary corporations. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we and our seven wholly-owned subsidiaries will file a consolidated corporate federal income tax return. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets to reduce their carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent along with the related valuation allowance. Due to our lack of earnings history, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.  18   We recognize benefits of uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained upon examination based solely on the technical merits, as the largest amount of benefits that is more likely than not to be realized upon the ultimate settlement. Our policy is to recognize i nterest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. To date, there have been no interest or penalties recognized in relation to the unrecognized tax benefits.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Our critical accounting policies are those policies which require the most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to accrued research and development costs and stock-based compensation.  There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operations included in our Prospectus dated April 6, 2016 filed with the SEC, except for the determination of the fair value of our common stock, which was used in estimating the fair value of stock-based awards at grant date. Prior to IPO, our stock was not publicly traded, therefore we estimated the fair value of our common stock as discussed in the Prospectus. Following our IPO, we established a policy, using the closing sale price per share of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market on the date of grant for purposes of determining the exercise price per share of our share-based awards to purchase common stock.  Results of Operations  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 and 2015  The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage:              *   Percentage not meaningful  Grant Revenues .We recorded grant revenue of $859,000 and $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The CPRIT grant agreement was executed in June 2015 and was not in effect during the three months ended March 31, 2015.  19   Research and Development Expenses .Research and development expenses increased by $2.0 million to $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 122%. Included in the research and development expenses are costs directly associated with our lead product candidate AEB1102, which increased to $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to:              Higher nonclinical expenses, which increased by $0.9 million as a result of increased toxicology study costs in preparation for multi-dose clinical trials related to AEB1102 and additional research with the University of Texas at Austin;              Higher personnel-related expenses, which increased by $0.5 million as a result of increased headcount to expand our internal regulatory and development capabilities and for the initiation of clinical trials for AEB1102 in patients with advanced solid tumors;              Higher clinical development expenses, which increased by $0.6 million primarily as a result of initiating our Phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with advanced solid tumors for AEB1102 in the second half of 2015 and preparing for our Phase 1 clinical trials for patients with hematological malignancies and Arginase I deficiency in the first quarter of 2016;  General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $1.0 million to $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 116%. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $0.3 million in employee compensation, recruiting, and travel expenses and $0.7 million in professional services, audit and legal fees associated with preparing to be a public company and the development of administrative functions.  Interest Income .Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The increase in interest income to $26,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from $1,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 was primarily due to funds invested from closing the Series B convertible preferred stock financing in March 2015 and purchased cash equivalents and marketable securities in September 2015.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Sources of liquidity  We are an early stage biotechnology company with a limited operating history, and due to our significant research and development expenditures, we have generated operating losses since our inception and have not generated any revenue from the sale of any products. Since our inception and through March 31, 2016, we have funded our operations by raising an aggregate of $54.7 million of gross proceeds from the sale and issuance of convertible preferred and common equity securities and collected $5.3 million in grant proceeds. Additionally, we entered into an agreement with our strategic manufacturing partner in 2013 to provide convertible preferred shares in exchange for services performed, with the obligation fully satisfied in June 2015.  In April 2016, we completed an IPO and sold 5,481,940 shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of $47.3 million net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Since we completed our IPO in April 2016, such proceeds are not reflected in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of March 31, 2016.  In June 2015, we entered into a Cancer Research Grant Contract with CPRIT, or the Grant Contract, under which we expect to generate up to $19.8 million in grant funding to fund our development of AEB1102. Through March 31, 2016, we have collected $5.3 million in grant proceeds with $14.5 million available for future collection under the grant contract. As of March 31, 2016, we have a grant receivable outstanding of $1.6 million.  Our primary use of cash is to fund the development of our lead product candidate, AEB1102. This includes both the research and development costs and the general and administrative expenses required to support those operations. Since we are an early stage company, we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and we anticipate such losses, in absolute dollar terms, to increase as we continue our clinical trials in AEB1102 and expand our development efforts in our pipeline of nonclinical candidates.  As of March 31, 2016, we had available cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $29.0 million. We believe that we have sufficient resources to fund our operations through March 31, 2018 with our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in conjunction with the proceeds received from our IPO.  20   Future funding requirements and operational plan  Our operational plan for the current and upcoming fiscal years ending December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, respectively, is to commence and continue clinical trials for our lead product candidate AEB1102 in three separate indications, solid tumor, hematological malignancy, and Arginase I deficiency, and to expand development for at least one additional product candidate. As such, we plan to increase our research and development expenditures for the foreseeable future with nonclinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing and an integrated biomarker strategy. We expect our principal expenditures during this time period to include expenses for the following:              funding the continuing development of AEB1102;              funding the advancement of additional product candidates; and              funding working capital, including general operating expenses.  We anticipate that we will continue to generate losses into the foreseeable future as we develop our lead product candidates, seek regulatory approval of those candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products. Until such time as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity or debt financings, research grants, collaborations, or other sources. We currently have no debt or debt facility or additional committed capital. To the extent that we raise additional equity, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be diluted.  Due to our significant research and development expenditures, we have generated substantial losses in each period since inception. We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $28.1 million through March 31, 2016. We expect to incur substantial losses in the future as we expand our research and development capabilities. Based on those plans, we expect that the net proceeds from the IPO, together with our existing cash, cash equivalent, and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, however, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect.  Cash flows  The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):          Cash used in operating activities  Cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $4.0 million and reflected a net loss of $4.5 million. Our net loss was offset in part by non-cash expenses of $0.1 million for stock-based compensation. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payables of $0.3 million and accrued and other liabilities of $0.5 million driven by an increase in accrued research and development costs, offset by a $0.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets driven by an increase in sponsored research and prepaid research and development costs.  Cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2015 was $2.5 million and reflected a net loss of $2.5 million. Included in the change in operating cash were offsetting changes from non-cash expenses of $0.2 million for services performed by our strategic manufacturing partner for previously issued convertible preferred stock and an increase of $0.2 million in prepaid expenses and other assets driven by an increase in sponsored research and deferred offering costs.  Cash used in investing activities  Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $1.2 million and consisted of $3.0 million in purchases of marketable securities offset by $1.8 million in maturities of marketable securities.  21   Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2015 was $20,000 and consisted of $10,000 in purchases of property and equipment and a $10,000 increase in restricted cash.  Cash provided by financing activities  Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $0.1 million from offering cost payments related to our IPO of our common stock.  Cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2015 was $43.7 million resulting from the $44.0 million closing of the Series B financing in March 2015, offset by $0.3 million in Series B issuance costs.  Contractual Obligations  In November 2014, we entered into an operating lease agreement to occupy office space in Austin, TX. The lease commenced in January 2015 and will continue through December 2017. The total of the estimated rent payments over the term of the lease are approximately $419,000.  In January 2016, we amended our research agreement with the University of Texas at Austin to increase the maximum limitation of funding by $82,000 for additional purchases with no increase in the term of the agreement. The effective agreement as of March 31, 2016 expires on August 31, 2016 with no remaining payment obligations.  Contingent contractual obligations  The terms of the CPRIT Grant Contract require that we pay tiered royalties in the low- to mid-single digit percentages on revenues from sales and license or products or services that are based upon, utilize, are developed from or materially incorporate the intellectual property resulting from the grant-funded activities for AEB1102. Such royalties reduce to less than one percent after a mid-single digit multiple of the grant funds have been repaid to CPRIT in royalties. Such royalties are payable for so long as we have marketing exclusivity or patents covering the applicable product or service (or twelve years from commercial sale of product or service in certain countries if there is no such exclusivity or patent protection).  On December 24, 2013, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, AECase, Inc. (AECase) and AEMase, Inc. (AEMase) entered into license agreements with the University of Texas at Austin (the University) under which the University has granted to AECase and AEMase exclusive, worldwide, sublicenseable licenses. The University granted the AECase license under a patent application relating to the right to use technology related to our AEB3103 product candidate. The University granted the AEMase license under a patent relating to the right to use technology related to our AEB2109 product candidate.  The licenses have substantially identical terms. With respect to each product candidate covered by a license with the University, AECase or AEMase could be required to pay the University up to $6.4 million milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development milestones, including clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the majority of which are due upon the achievement of later development milestones, including a $5.0 million payment due on regulatory approval of a product and a $500,000 payment payable on final regulatory approval of a product for a second indication. AECase and AEMase are also required to pay an annual license fee, ranging from $5,000 to $25,000. In addition, AECase and AEMase will pay the University a low single digit royalty on worldwide-net sales of products covered under each license agreement, together with a revenue share on non-royalty consideration received from sublicensees. The rate of the revenue share depends on the date the sublicense agreement is signed. The rate is 30% for agreements signed in 2014, 25% for agreements signed in 2015, 20% for agreements signed in 2016, 15% for agreements signed in 2017 and 6.5% for agreements signed in 2018 and thereafter. The University may terminate the agreement for breach by AECase or AEMase that is not cured within 30 or 60 days of notice (depending on the type of breach) and three or more financial breaches in any nine month period which, even if cured, were not cured within 30 days of notice, or if AECase or AEMase or any of their respective affiliates or sublicensees participates in any proceeding to challenge the licensed patent rights (unless, with respect to sublicensees, AECase or AEMase terminates the applicable sublicense).  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC regulations.  22   Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to continue as a Going Concern, which provides guidance on the presentation of management's plans, when conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The new standard is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , which establishes a comprehensive new lease accounting model. The new standard: (a) clarifies the definition of a lease; (b) requires a dual approach to lease classification similar to current lease classifications; and, (c) causes lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with a lease-term of more than twelve months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires modified retrospective application. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
