Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements        1. The Company and Basis of Presentation  Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc. ("Aeglea" or the "Company") is a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to developing enzyme-based therapeutics in the field of amino acid metabolism to treat rare genetic diseases and cancer. The Company was formed as a Limited Liability Company (LLC) in Delaware on December 16, 2013 under the name Aeglea BioTherapeutics Holdings, LLC and was converted from a Delaware LLC to a Delaware corporation (the "LLC Conversion") on March 10, 2015. The Company operates in one segment and has its principal offices in Austin, Texas.  Initial Public Offering  On April 6, 2016, the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-205001) relating to the initial public offering ("IPO") of its common stock was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The IPO closed on April 12, 2016, and 5,481,940 shares of common stock were sold at a public offering price of $10.00 per share, including 481,940 shares of common stock issued upon the partial exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The Company received $47.3 million in aggregate cash proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.8 million and offering costs of $3.7 million incurred by the Company.  Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, all shares of outstanding convertible preferred stock were automatically converted, at a ratio of one share of common stock for each share of convertible preferred stock, into 7,172,496 shares of common stock with the related carrying value of $58.3 million reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital.  In connection with the IPO, the Company amended its Restated Certificate of Incorporation to change the authorized capital stock to 510,000,000 shares of which 500,000,000 shares are designated as common stock and 10,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock, all with a par value of $0.0001 per share. There are no shares of preferred stock outstanding as of March 31, 2017.  Liquidity  As of March 31, 2017, the Company had working capital of $56.3 million, an accumulated deficit of $51.5 million, and cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $57.9 million. The Company has not generated any product revenues and has not achieved profitable operations. There is no assurance that profitable operations will ever be achieved, and, if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis. In addition, development activities, clinical and nonclinical testing, and commercialization of the Company's products will require significant additional financing.  The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other life science companies, including, but not limited to, risks related to the successful discovery and development of product candidates, raising additional capital, development of competing drugs and therapies, protection of proprietary technology and market acceptance of the Company's products. As a result of these and other factors and the related uncertainties, there can be no assurance of the Company's future success.  Based upon the Company's current operating plan, the Company believes that it has sufficient resources to fund operations through March 31, 2019 with its existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The Company will need to secure additional funding in the future, in order to carry out all of its planned research and development activities. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing or generate license or product revenue, the lack of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future prospects.  Unaudited Interim Financial Information  The interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this document are unaudited. The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature that are necessary for a fair statement of the Company's financial position as of March 31, 2017, and its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2017 or for any other future annual or interim period. The December 31, 2016 balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally  5      accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). These financial state ments should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 as filed with the SEC.        2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such management estimates include those related to accruals of research and development related costs, fair values of preferred and common stock, stock-based compensation, and certain company income tax related items. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and relevant assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds and debt securities and are stated at fair value.  Marketable Securities  All investments have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at estimated fair value as determined based upon quoted market prices or pricing models for similar securities. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt securities at the time of purchase. The Company may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than one year until maturity. All available-for-sale securities are considered available to support current operations and are classified as current assets.  Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of accumulated comprehensive loss. Realized gains and losses and declines in fair value judged to be other than temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are included in other income  (expense). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. There were no realized gains or losses on marketable securities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Interest on marketable securities is included in interest income.  Concentration of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The Company's investment policy limits investments to high credit quality securities issued by the U.S. government, U.S. government-sponsored agencies and highly rated banks, subject to certain concentration limits and restrictions on maturities. The Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held by financial institutions in the United States that management believes are of high credit quality. Amounts on deposit may at times exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents and its accounts are monitored by management to mitigate risk. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions holding its cash and cash equivalents and bond issuers.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Repairs and maintenance that do not extend the life or improve an asset are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of disposed assets and their related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the balance sheet. Any gain or loss is credited or charged to operations.  6      The useful lives of the prop erty and equipment are as follows:         Laboratory equipment       5 years     Furniture and office equipment       5 years     Computer equipment       3 years     Software       3 years     Leasehold improvements       Shorter of remaining lease term or estimated useful life       Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Long-lived assets are reviewed for indications of possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent an asset group is not recoverable, and the carrying amount exceeds the projected discounted future cash flows arising from these assets. There were no impairments of long-lived assets for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.  Accrued Research and Development Costs  The Company records the costs associated with research nonclinical studies, clinical trials, and manufacturing development as incurred. These costs are a significant component of the Company's research and development expenses, with a substantial portion of the Company's on-going research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers, including contract research and manufacturing organizations.  The Company accrues for expenses resulting from obligations under agreements with contract research organizations ("CROs"), contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs"), and other outside service providers for which payment flows do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to the Company. Accruals are recorded based on estimates of services received and efforts expended pursuant to agreements established with CROs, CMOs, and other outside service providers. These estimates are typically based on contracted amounts applied to the proportion of work performed and determined through analysis with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services. The Company makes significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each reporting period. In the event advance payments are made to a CRO, CMO, or outside service provider, the payments will be recorded as a prepaid asset which will be amortized as the contracted services are performed. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its accruals. Inputs, such as the services performed, the number of patients enrolled, or the study duration, may vary from the Company's estimates, resulting in adjustments to research and development expense in future periods. Changes in these estimates that result in material changes to the Company's accruals could materially affect the Company's results of operations. The Company has not experienced any material deviations between accrued and actual research and development expenses.  Leases  The Company entered into lease agreements for its office and laboratory facilities. The leases are classified as operating leases. The Company records rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases and, accordingly records the difference between cash rent payments and the recognition of rent expense as a deferred rent liability. Incentives granted under the Company's facilities leases, including allowances to fund leasehold improvements, are deferred and are recognized as adjustments to rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. The accounting standards define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and require disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact are considered along with assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.  7      The accounting standard for fair value establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, the first two of which are considered observable and the la st unobservable, that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:          Level1:   Observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.          Level2:   Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.          Level3 :   Valuations based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and including data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances.  Financial instruments carried at fair value include cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The carrying amount of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities.  Revenue Recognition  The Company's sole source of revenue is grant revenue related to a $19.8 million research grant received from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas ("CPRIT"), covering a four-year period from June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2018. Grant revenue is recognized when qualifying costs are incurred and there is reasonable assurance that the conditions of the award have been met for collection. Proceeds received prior to the costs being incurred or the conditions of the award being met are recognized as deferred revenue until the services are performed and the conditions of the award are met (see Note 5).  Research and Development Costs  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs include, but are not limited to, salaries, benefits, travel, share-based compensation, consulting costs, contract research service costs, laboratory supplies, contract manufacturing costs, and costs paid to other third parties that conduct research and development activities on the Company's behalf. Amounts incurred in connection with license agreements are also included in research and development expense.  Certain research and development costs incurred were settled contractually by the Company issuing a variable number of the Company's shares determined by dividing the fixed monetary amount of costs incurred by the issuance-date fair value of the issuable shares. The Company recorded research and development expense for these costs and accrued for the fixed monetary amount as an accrued liability as the services were rendered until the amount was settled. In June 2015, the remaining Company obligation to settle these costs with Company shares was converted to a cash-based payment through a contract amendment with the service provider.  Advance payments for goods or services to be rendered in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as a prepaid asset and expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company recognizes the cost of stock-based awards granted to employees based on the estimated grant-date fair values of the awards. The value of the award is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes the compensation costs for awards that vest over several years on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur, which may result in the reversal of compensation costs in subsequent periods as the forfeitures arise. The Company recognizes the cost of stock-based awards granted to nonemployees at their then-current fair values as services are performed, and are remeasured through the counterparty performance date.  8      Income Taxes  Effective January 1, 2015, the Company, for tax purposes, converted from a partnership to a corporation and continues to serve as a holding company for seven wholly-owned subsidiary corporations. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company filed a consolidated corporate federal income tax return. The Company and its subsidiaries use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets to reduce their carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent along with the related valuation allowance. Due to a lack of earnings history, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.  The Company recognizes benefits of uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained upon examination based solely on the technical merits, as the largest amount of benefits that is more likely than not be realized upon the ultimate settlement. The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.  Comprehensive Loss  Comprehensive loss is the change in stockholders' equity from transactions and other events and circumstances other than those resulting from investments by stockholders and distributions to stockholders. The Company's other comprehensive income (loss) is currently comprised of changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities.  Reclassification  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation. These reclassifications did not have an impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , which establishes a comprehensive new lease accounting model. The new standard: (a) clarifies the definition of a lease; (b) requires a dual approach to lease classification similar to current lease classifications; and, (c) causes lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with a lease-term of more than twelve months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires modified retrospective application. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements, but expect the impact to be limited to the operating lease agreements for the office and laboratory spaces in Austin, Texas.        3. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  The following tables summarize the estimated fair value of the Company's cash equivalents and marketable securities and the gross unrealized gains and losses (in thousands):       9             The reverse repurchase agreements are settled in cash nightly, and as such are classified as cash equivalents.  As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company held 22 and nine debt securities, respectively, that were in an unrealized loss position for less than one year. The aggregate fair value of debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $41.1 million and $15.8 million, respectively, with no individual securities in a significant unrealized loss position. The Company evaluated its securities for other-than-temporary impairment and considered the decline in market value for the securities to be primarily attributable to current economic and market conditions and would not be required to sell the securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis. Based on this analysis, these marketable securities were not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.  The following tables summarizes the contractual maturities of the Company's marketable securities at estimated fair value (in thousands):          The Company may sell investments at any time for use in current operations even if they have not yet reached maturity. As a result, the Company classifies marketable securities, including securities with maturities beyond twelve months as current assets.        4. Accrued and Other Current Liabilities  Accrued and other current liabilities consist of the following (in thousands):             5. Grant Revenues  In June 2015, the Company entered into a Cancer Research Grant Contract ("Grant Contract") with CPRIT, under which CPRIT awarded a grant not to exceed $19.8 million for use in developing cancer treatments by exploiting the metabolism of cancer cells. The Grant Contract covers a four-year period from June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2018.  10      Upon commercialization of the product, the terms of the Grant Contract require the Company to pay tiered royalties in the low to mid-single digit percentages. Such royalties reduce to less than one percent after a mid-single-digit multiple of the grant funds have been paid to CPRIT in royalties.  The Company recognized grant revenue of $982,000 and $859,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for qualified expenditures under the grant. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had an outstanding grant receivable of $981,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, for the grant expenditures that were paid but had not been reimbursed and deferred revenue of $51,000 and $71,000, respectively, for proceeds received but for which the costs had not been incurred or the conditions of the award had not been met.        6. Stock-Based Compensation  The 2016 Equity Incentive Plan ("2016 Plan") provides for an automatic annual increase in the number of shares available for issuance thereunder, to be added on the first day of each fiscal year, beginning on January 1, 2017 and continuing through 2023, up to 4% of the outstanding number of shares of the Company's common stock on the December 31 immediately prior to the date of increase, provided that an increase is only effective if the Company's board of directors either confirmed the automatic increase or approved the increase of a lesser number of shares prior to January 1 of each relevant year . As a result of this provision, on January 1, 2017, an additional 537,233 shares became available for issuance under the 2016 Plan.  The Company granted equity awards under its 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("2015 Plan") until April 2016 when it was terminated as to future awards, although it continues to govern the terms of awards that remain outstanding under the 2015 Plan. In connection with the Company's adoption of the 2016 Plan, all remaining shares available for future issuance under the 2015 Plan were transferred to the 2016 Plan.  During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 772,800 and 84,417 options, respectively, to purchase common stock under its equity incentive plans for an aggregate fair value of $4,161,205 and $332,000, respectively. Additionally, the Company issued and sold 18,184 shares under the 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("2016 ESPP") for aggregate cash proceeds of $78,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2017. There were no shares issued and sold under the 2016 ESPP during the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Total stock-based compensation expense related to the Company's equity incentive plans and 2016 ESPP was as follows (in thousands):          11      The following table summarizes the weighted-average Black-Scholes option pricing model assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted under the equity incentive plans and the shares purchasable under the 2016 ESPP during the periods p resented:             7. Fair Value Measurements  The Company measures and reports certain financial instruments as assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. The following tables sets forth the fair value of the Company's financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis based on the three-tier fair value hierarchy (in thousands):               The Company measures the fair value of money market funds on quoted prices in active markets for identical asset or liabilities. The Level 2 assets include reverse repurchase agreements and U.S. government and agency securities and are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are derived from observable market data.  The Company evaluates transfers between levels at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the periods presented.        8. Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders  The Company computed net loss attributable per common stockholder using the two-class method required for participating securities through the date of the IPO. Immediately prior to the IPO, all outstanding convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock (see Note 1). The Company considered convertible preferred stock to be participating securities. In the event that the Company had paid out distributions, holders of convertible preferred stock would have participated in the distribution.  12      The two-class method is an earnings (loss) allocation method under whi ch earnings (loss) per share is calculated for common stock and participating security considering a participating security's rights to undistributed earnings (loss) as if all such earnings (loss) had been distributed during the period. The convertible pre ferred stock did not have an obligation to fund losses and are therefore excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per share. The Company's SeriesA and B convertible preferred stock were entitled to receive noncumulative dividends and in preference to any dividends on shares of the Company's common stock.  Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period. For periods in which the Company generated a net loss, the Company does not include the potential impact of dilutive securities in diluted net loss per share, as the impact of these items is anti-dilutive.  The following weighted-average equity instruments were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented:             9. Research and License Agreements  University Research Agreement  In December 2013, the Company entered into a research agreement with the University of Texas at Austin (the "University"). Under the terms of this research agreement, the Company engaged the University to perform certain nonclinical research activities related to the systemic depletion of amino acids for cancer therapy and rare disease therapy.  Under the research agreement, the Company was required to pay the University an annual amount not to exceed $386,000 during the one year term of the agreement from the effective date. Pursuant to subsequent amendments to the research agreement, the term and maximum expenditure limitation were extended and increased through August 31, 2017 for a combined $1.8 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company paid $188,000 and $457,000, respectively, the University under the research agreement.  License Agreements  In December 2013, two of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries, AECase, Inc. ("AECase") and AEMase, Inc. ("AEMase"), entered into license agreements with the University under which the University granted to AECase and AEMase exclusive, worldwide, sublicenseable licenses. The University granted the AECase license under a patent application relating to the right to use technology related to the Company's AEB3103 product candidate. The University granted the AEMase license under a patent relating to the right to use technology related to the Company's AEB2109 product candidate.  In January 2017, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement (the "Restated License") with the University which consolidated the two license agreements, revised certain obligations, and licensed additional patent applications and invention disclosures to the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Restated License, the Company may be required to pay the University up to $6.4 million milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development milestones, including clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the majority of which are due upon the achievement of later development milestones, including a $5.0 million payment due on regulatory approval of a product and a $500,000 payment payable on final regulatory approval of a product for a second indication. In addition, the Company is required to pay the University a low single-digit royalty on worldwide-net sales of products covered under the Restated License, together with a revenue share on non-royalty consideration received from sublicensees. The rate of the revenue share ranges from 6.5% to 25% depending on the date the sublicense agreement is signed.        13      10 .  Related Party Transactions  The spouse of the Company's Chief Executive Officer previously provided consulting services to the Company. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, there were no payments made to the spouse in consulting fees. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company paid $129,000 to the spouse in consulting fees, which were recorded in Research and Development expenses. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had no outstanding liability to the related party.  One of the founders, a non-employee member of the Company's Board of Directors, entered into a consulting agreement with the Company in 2014 under which the founder would receive $50,000 per year for a fixed number of hours of consulting and advisory services and receive equity incentive shares, which converted into 43,290 restricted stock awards and 13,852 stock options upon the LLC Conversion, with the vesting contingent on time and performance milestones being achieved. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, there were no payments made to the Founder under the consulting agreement. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company paid $13,000 to the Founder under the consulting agreement. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had no outstanding liability to the related party.        11. Commitments and Contingencies  The Company leases office space in Austin, Texas under an operating lease that commenced in January 2015. The lease was amended in September 2016 to increase office space and extend the term to December 31, 2020.   Under the terms of the amended office lease agreement, the security deposit requirement was set at $39,000 until the expiration of the lease. The lessor is entitled to retain all or any part of the security deposit for payment in the event of any uncured default by the Company under the terms of the lease.  In February 2017, the Company entered into a lease agreement for laboratory facilities in Austin, Texas under an operating lease, which will expire in December 2017.   The following table summarizes the Company's future minimum lease commitments as of March 31, 2017 (in thousands):          For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company incurred $76,000 and $35,000, respectively, in rent expense under noncancellable operating leases.  12. Subsequent Events  On April 21, 2017, the Company appointed a member of its board of directors as interim chief medical officer ("interim CMO"). Under the employment agreement, the interim CMO will receive a salary of $27,000 per month and an option to purchase 24,000 shares of common stock, subject to a service condition.  On May 1, 2017, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for the potential offering, issuance and sale by the Company of up to $150 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants to purchase common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subscription rights to purchase common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, and units consisting of all or some of these securities. The shelf registration statement has not been declared effective by the SEC. Up to $20 million of the maximum aggregate offering price of $150 million under the registration statement, if declared effective by the SEC, may be issued and sold pursuant to an "at-the-market" offering for sales of the Company's common stock pursuant to a sales agreement between the Company and JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC.        14          Item2 .     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as the audited consolidated financial statements and notes and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on March 23, 2017. This discussion and other parts of this Quarterly Report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section of this report entitled "Risk Factors."  Overview  We are a biotechnology company committed to developing enzyme-based therapeutics in the field of amino acid metabolism to treat rare genetic diseases and cancer. Our engineered human enzymes are designed to degrade specific amino acids in the blood to target these diseases. In inborn errors of metabolism, or IEM, a subset of rare genetic diseases, we are seeking to reduce the toxic levels of amino acids in patients to the normal range. In oncology, we are seeking to reduce amino acid blood levels below the normal range where we believe we will be able to exploit the dependence of certain cancers on specific amino acids.  Our lead product candidate, AEB1102, is engineered to degrade the amino acid arginine and is being developed to treat two extremes of arginine metabolism, including arginine excess in patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency, an IEM, as well as some cancers which have been shown to have a metabolic dependence on arginine. AEB1102 has demonstrated clinical proof-of-mechanism in both scenarios. In a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency, a dose-proportional reduction in plasma arginine levels was observed in two patients. A reduction in blood arginine levels was also observed in Phase 1 clinical trials for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors and the hematological malignancies relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS. These preliminary results support its potential use as a therapeutic of both Arginase 1 Deficiency and certain cancers associated with abnormal amino acid metabolism.  We are conducting three clinical trials for AEB1102, consisting of one Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of Arginase 1 Deficiency and two Phase 1 clinical trials for the treatment of certain cancers.              Arginase 1 Deficiency . Following completion of dosing for the first two adult patients in our Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency, we submitted a protocol amendment in November 2016 to broaden the scope of our Phase 1 trial into a Phase 1/2 trial. The amended protocol includes dosing of pediatric patients (two and older) and weekly repeat dosing, with the intent to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical response of AEB1102 in patients with this IEM. In the first quarter of 2017, we received Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval for the Phase 1/2 protocol for the treatment of patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency at multiple IRBs. In March 2017, we received an information request from the FDA which included comments and recommendations on the protocol amendment and a request for supporting documents based on their review of our completed toxicology studies, our dose escalation plan and our information to support the inclusion of pediatric patients. As recommended by the FDA, we replied with supporting information and completed a follow-up meeting. At this time, we believe our Phase 1/2 protocol provides an appropriate path to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AEB1102 in pediatric patients, and pending FDA feedback, we plan to initiate dosing in pediatric patients in the middle of 2017. In March 2017, we announced results from the first two adult patients in our Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of Arginase 1 Deficiency at the 2017 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Annual Clinical Genetics Meeting, or ACMG Annual Meeting. We intend to continue enrollment of adult patients and plan to dose additional adult patients in the middle of 2017. Topline data from this trial is expected in the first half of 2018.  15                    Advanced Solid Tumors . In Oc tober 2015, we initiated enrollment for a Phase 1 dose escalation trial for cancer patients with advanced solid tumors. In this ongoing trial, AEB1102 i s well-tolerated and patients have demonstrated a reduction in blood arginine levels, providing proof-of -mechanism. We expect to announce results of this Phase 1 dose escalation in patients with advanced solid tumors and anticipate initiating expansion arms in specific solid tumor types, potentially in combination with existing or emerging standards of care, in the fourth quarter of 2017 or the first quarter of 2018.              Hematological Malignancies . In July 2016, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with the hematological malignancies AML and MDS in the United States and Canada. As demonstrated in the trial for patients with advanced solid tumors, the first three cohorts of this trial have demonstrated proof-of-mechanism. We expect to announce results of the Phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with AML and MDS in the fourth quarter of 2017 or the first quarter of 2018.  We are also building a pipeline of additional product candidates targeting key amino acids and other metabolites, including homocystine, a target for another IEM as well as cysteine, and its oxidized form cystine, and methionine, for cancer indications.   Since inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to identifying and developing product candidates, conducting nonclinical studies, initiating and conducting clinical trials, recruiting personnel and raising capital. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, the initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, completed on April 12, 2016, and collection of a research grant.  We have not recorded revenue from product sales and all of our revenue to date has been grant revenue. Since our inception, and through March 31, 2017, we have raised an aggregate of $109.7 million to fund our operations through sale and issuance of convertible preferred and common equity securities and collected $10.8 million in grant proceeds. As of March 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $57.9 million.  We have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $6.2 million and $4.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative expenses associated with our operations. As of March 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $51.5 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we continue our clinical and diagnostic development activities for our lead product candidate, AEB1102; concurrently develop our pipeline product candidates; expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel. In addition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.  Recent Developments  In April 2017, we presented preclinical data at the 2017 American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting, which demonstrated that reducing systemic arginine with AEB1102 in preclinical models did not suppress the immune response induced by anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1, and exerted an additive anti-tumor and synergistic survival benefit.  Components of Operating Results  Revenue  To date, we have recognized revenue solely from a research grant from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, or CPRIT, and have not generated any revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates. Our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for several years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and eventual commercialization of our product candidates.  In June 2015, we entered into a grant agreement with CPRIT, or the Grant Contract, for $19.8 million for use in developing cancer treatments by exploiting the metabolism of cancer cells. The Grant Contract covers a four year period from June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2018. The grant allows us to receive funds in advance of costs and allowable expenses being incurred. We record the revenue as qualifying costs are incurred and there is reasonable assurance that the conditions of the award have been met for collection. Proceeds received prior to the costs being incurred or the conditions of the award being met are recognized as deferred revenue until the services are performed and the conditions of the award are met.  16      On a quarterly basis, we are required to submit a financial reporting package outlining the nature and extent of reimbursable costs paid and requesting reimbursement under the grant. At th e end of each period, qualifying costs paid prior to reimbursement result in the recognition of a grant receivable.  Research and development expenses  Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the discovery and development of our product candidates, most notably, our lead product candidate AEB1102. Since we currently do not have manufacturing capabilities and did not have an internal research laboratory before February 2017, we contracted with external providers for nonclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing services. Our research and development expenses include:              costs from acquiring clinical trial materials and services performed for contracted services with a contract manufacturing organization;              fees paid to clinical trial sites, clinical research organizations, contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, nonclinical research companies, and academic institutions;              employee and consultant-related expenses incurred, which include salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation; and              expenses incurred under license agreements with third parties.  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods or services to be rendered in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.  Research and development expenses have historically represented the largest component of our total operating expenses. We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product candidates.  Our expenditures on current and future nonclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:              the scope, rate of progress, and expenses of our ongoing research activities as well as any additional clinical trials and other research and development activities;              future clinical trial results;              uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rates or drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;              potential safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;              significant and changing government regulation; and              the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals, if any.  The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain FDA and other regulatory approval is costly and time consuming and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. The risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report titled "Risk Factors." As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.  General and administrative expenses  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, operations, and human resources functions. Other significant costs include legal fees relating to corporate matters and fees for insurance, accounting, consulting, and recruiting services.  17      We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our continued research and development activ ities, and the potential commercializ ation of our product candidates . These increases will likely include higher costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, among other expenses. Additionall y, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased costs associated with being a public company, including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with NASDAQ listing rules and SEC requirements, insurance and investor relations costs.  Interest income  Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.  Income taxes  We serve as a holding company for our seven wholly-owned subsidiary corporations and file consolidated corporate federal income tax returns. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets to reduce their carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent along with the related valuation allowance. Due to our lack of earnings history, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.  We recognize benefits of uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained upon examination based solely on the technical merits, as the largest amount of benefits that is more likely than not to be realized upon the ultimate settlement. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Our critical accounting policies are those policies which require the most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with our most critical accounting policies are those relating to accrued research and development costs and stock-based compensation.  There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  18      Results of Operations  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016  The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage:              *   Percentage not meaningful  Grant Revenues .Grant revenues increased by $0.1 million, or 14%, to $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to additional research and development costs associated with the clinical trials for AEB1102 in patients with advanced solid tumors and the hematological malignancies AML and MDS, for which we received grant revenue pursuant to the Grant Contract.  Research and Development Expenses .Research and development expenses increased by $1.3 million, or 38%, to $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The change in research and development expenses was primarily due to:              Higher personnel-related expenses, which increased by $0.8 million as a result of additional employee headcount to expand our internal regulatory, research laboratory, and clinical development capabilities;              Higher manufacturing expenses, which increased by $0.6 million as a result of scaling-up the development and clinical manufacturing for AEB1102 and manufacturing activities for pipeline development;              Higher clinical development expenses, which increased by $0.3 million as a result of initiating our Phase 1 dose escalation trial for AEB1102 in patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency in June 2016 and our Phase 1 trial for AEB1102 in patients with hematological malignancies in July 2016;              Higher intellectual property-related expenses, which increased by $0.2 million as a result of amending and consolidating license agreements with the University of Texas at Austin for our product candidates AEB3103 and AEB2109; and              Lower nonclinical expenses, which decreased by $0.6 million as a result of completing toxicology studies in 2016 for the preparation of multi-dose clinical trials related to AEB1102.  General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $0.5 million, or 29%, to $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $0.4 million in employee compensation, recruiting, and travel expenses and $0.1 million in insurance and other administrative costs associated with being a public company.  Interest Income .Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The increase in interest income to $95,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $26,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was primarily due to the investment of additional funds received as a result of our IPO in April 2016.  19      Liquidity and Capital Resources  Sources of liquidity  We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a limited operating history, and due to our significant research and development expenditures, we have generated operating losses since our inception and have not generated any revenue from the sale of any products. Since our inception and through March 31, 2017, we have funded our operations by raising an aggregate of $109.7 million of gross proceeds from the sale and issuance of convertible preferred and common equity securities and collecting $10.8 million in grant proceeds. Additionally, we entered into an agreement with a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, in 2013 whereby we issued convertible preferred shares to the CMO in exchange for services performed, with the obligation fully satisfied in June 2015.  In April 2016, we completed our IPO and sold 5,481,940 shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of $47.3 million net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.  In June 2015, we entered into the Grant Contract with CPRIT, under which we expect to generate up to $19.8 million in grant funding to fund our development of AEB1102. Through March 31, 2017, we have collected $10.8 million in grant proceeds with $9.0 million available for future collection under the grant contract. As of March 31, 2017, we have a grant receivable outstanding of $1.0 million.  Our primary use of cash is to fund the development of our lead product candidate, AEB1102. This includes both the research and development costs and the general and administrative expenses required to support those operations. Since we are a clinical-stage biotechnology company, we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and we anticipate such losses, in absolute dollar terms, to increase as we continue our clinical trials in AEB1102 and expand our development efforts in our pipeline of nonclinical candidates.  As of March 31, 2017, we had available cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $57.9 million. Under our current operating plan, we believe that we have sufficient resources to fund our operations through March 31, 2019 with our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.  Future funding requirements and operational plan  Our operational plan for the near future is to continue clinical trials for our lead product candidate AEB1102 in three separate indications: Arginase 1 Deficiency, advanced solid tumors, and the hematological malignancies AML and MDS, and to expand development for at least one additional product candidate. As such, we plan to increase our research and development expenditures for the foreseeable future with nonclinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing and an integrated biomarker strategy. We expect our principal expenditures during this time period to include expenses for the following:              funding the continuing development of AEB1102;              funding the advancement of additional product candidates; and              funding working capital, including general operating expenses.  We anticipate that we will continue to generate losses into the foreseeable future as we develop our product candidates, seek regulatory approval of those candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products. Until such time as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity or debt financings, research grants, collaborations, or other sources. We currently have no debt or debt facility or additional committed capital. To the extent that we raise additional equity, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be diluted.  Due to our significant research and development expenditures, we have generated substantial losses in each period since inception. We have an accumulated deficit of $51.5 million as of March 31, 2017. We expect to incur substantial losses in the future as we expand our research and development capabilities. Based on those plans, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalent, and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least through March 31, 2019. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, however, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect.  20      Cash flows  The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):          Cash used in operating activities  Cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $5.4 million and reflected a net loss of $6.2 million. Our net loss was offset in part by non-cash expenses of $0.4 million for stock-based compensation and by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.4 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the collection and recognition of $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in grant accounts receivable under the Grant Contract during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and increased manufacturing and clinical activities resulting in decreased prepaid expenses of $0.2 million.  Cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $4.0 million and reflected a net loss of $4.5 million. Our net loss was offset in part by non-cash expenses of $0.1 million for stock-based compensation and by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.4 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in nonclinical and clinical activities in preparation for multi-dose clinical trials and conducting our Phase 1 dose escalation trial for AEB1102 in patients with advanced solid tumors which resulted in increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $0.7 million and decreased prepaid expenses of $0.4 million.  Cash used in investing activities  Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $25.6 million and primarily consisted of $32.8 million in purchases of marketable securities and $0.3 million in purchases of property and equipment to develop an internal research laboratory, offset by $7.4 million in maturities of marketable securities.  Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $1.2 million and consisted of $3.0 million in purchases of marketable securities offset by $1.8 million in maturities of marketable securities.  Cash provided by financing activities  Cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $0.1 million and was a result of the sale of common stock under our 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the exercise of stock options.  Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $0.1 million from offering cost payments related to our IPO of our common stock.  Contractual Obligations  In September 2016, we amended our operating lease agreement for office space in Austin, Texas. The amended lease increased the office space and extended the lease term through December 31, 2020. The total estimated rent payments over the remaining term of the lease as of March 31, 2017 is approximately $1.1 million.  In February 2017, we entered into a separate lease agreement for laboratory space in Austin, Texas, which will expire on December 31, 2017. The total estimated rent payments over the remaining term of the lease as of March 31, 2017 is approximately $52,000.  21      In August 2016, we amended our research agreement with the University. The scope and term under the agreement were extended through August 31, 2017 with a $750,000 increase in the maximum expenditure limitation. As of March 31, 2017 , the research agreement, as amended, expires on August 31, 2017 with no remaining payment obligations after such date.  Contingent contractual obligations  The terms of the Grant Contract require that we pay CPRIT tiered royalties in the low- to mid-single digit percentages on revenues from sales and license or products or services that are based upon, utilize, are developed from or materially incorporate the intellectual property resulting from the grant-funded activities for AEB1102. Such royalties reduce to less than one percent after a mid-single digit multiple of the grant funds have been repaid to CPRIT in royalties. Such royalties are payable for so long as we have marketing exclusivity or patents covering the applicable product or service (or twelve years from commercial sale of product or service in certain countries if there is no such exclusivity or patent protection).  On December 24, 2013, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, AECase, Inc., or AECase, and AEMase, Inc., or AEMase, entered into license agreements with the University under which the University granted to AECase and AEMase exclusive, worldwide, sublicenseable licenses. The University granted to AECase a license under a patent application relating to the right to use technology related to our AEB3103 product candidate. The University granted to AEMase a license under a patent relating to the right to use technology related to our AEB2109 product candidate. On January 31, 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement, or the Restated License, with the University which consolidated the two license agreements dated December 24, 2013, revised certain obligations, and licensed additional patent applications and invention disclosures to Aeglea.  With respect to each product candidate covered by the Restated License, we could be required to pay the University up to $6.4 million in milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development milestones, including clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the majority of which are due upon the achievement of later development milestones, including a $5.0 million payment due on regulatory approval of a product and a $500,000 payment payable on final regulatory approval of a product for a second indication. In addition, we are required to pay the University a low single digit royalty on worldwide-net sales of products covered under the Restated License, together with a revenue share on non-royalty consideration received from sublicensees. The rate of the revenue share ranges from 6.5% to 25% depending on the date the sublicense agreement is signed. The University may terminate the agreement under certain circumstances, including for a breach by us that is not cured within 30 or 60 days of notice (depending on the type of breach), or if we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees participate in any proceeding to challenge the licensed patent rights (unless, with respect to sublicensees, we terminate the applicable sublicense).  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  Through March 31, 2017, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC regulations.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which establishes a comprehensive new lease accounting model. The new standard: (a) clarifies the definition of a lease; (b) requires a dual approach to lease classification similar to current lease classifications; and, (c) causes lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with a lease-term of more than twelve months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires modified retrospective application. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements, but expect the impact to be limited to the operating lease agreement for office and laboratory space in Austin, Texas.
