  Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Accuray Incorporated  Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  (in thousands, except share amounts and par value)  (Unaudited)        (1)  The condensed consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2015 has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements.    The accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed consolidated financial statements.    3           Accuray Incorporated  Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss  (in thousands, except per share amounts)  (Unaudited)       The accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed consolidated financial statements.    4           Accuray Incorporated  Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows  (in thousands)  (Unaudited)       The accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed consolidated financial statements.    5           Accuray Incorporated  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  (Unaudited)    1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    Description of Business    Accuray Incorporated (together with its subsidiaries, the  Company  or  Accuray ) is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Sunnyvale, California. The Company designs, develops and sells advanced radiosurgery and radiation therapy systems for the treatment of tumors throughout the body. The Company has offices in the United States, Switzerland, China and Japan and conducts its business worldwide.    Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation    The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.    The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), pursuant to the rulesand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).Certain information and note disclosures have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rulesand regulations.The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the periods presented. The results for the three and six months ended December31, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending June30, 2016, for any other future interim period or future year.    These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended June30, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form10-K filed with the SEC on August28, 2015. The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to those audited consolidated financial statements and there have been no material changes to such policies.    Recent Accounting Standard Update Not Yet Effective    In May2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing GAAP including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. On July9, 2015, FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective period for ASU 2014-09. The standard will be effective for the Company for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, but entities will be permitted to early adopt the standard as of the original effective date, which would be the first quarter of fiscal 2018 for the Company. The Company may adopt either of two methods: (i)retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (ii)retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU 2014-09. The Company has not yet selected a transition method, has not yet determined whether it will select early adoption and is currently evaluating the impact of pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.    Use of Estimates    The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements. Key estimates and assumptions made by the Company relate to revenue recognition, assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of inventories, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, allowance for doubtful accounts, loss contingencies and corporate bonus expenses. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.    6           Concentration of Credit and Other Risks    The Company s cash, cash equivalents and investments are deposited with several major financial institutions. At times, deposits in these institutions exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe that it is exposed to any significant risk of loss on these balances.    For the three months ended December31, 2015 and 2014, there were no customers that represented 10% or more of total net revenue. For the six months ended December31, 2015, there was one customer that represented 11% of total net revenue. For the six months ended December31, 2014, there were no customers that represented 10% or more of total net revenue. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company s total accounts receivable as of December31, 2015. One customer accounted for 18% of the Company s total accounts receivable as of June30, 2015.    Accounts receivable are typically not collateralized. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains reserves for potential credit losses. Accounts receivable are deemed past due in accordance with the contractual terms of the agreement. Accounts are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once collection efforts are unsuccessful.    Single source suppliers presently provide the Company with several components. In most cases, if a supplier was unable to deliver these components, the Company believes that it would be able to find other sources for these components subject to any regulatory qualifications, if required.    Revenue Recognition    The Company earns revenue from the sale of products and related services. The Company records its revenues net of any value added or sales tax. For arrangements with multiple elements, the Company allocates arrangement fees to products and services based upon Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value of the respective elements, Third-Party Evidence ( TPE ), or Best Estimate of Selling Price ( BESP ), using the relative selling price method.    Product and Service Revenue    The majority of product revenue is generated from sales of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems. If the Company is responsible for installation, the Company recognizes revenue after installation and acceptance of the system. Otherwise, revenue is recognized upon delivery, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.    The Company offers its systems with post-contract customer support ( PCS ) contracts, installation services, training and professional services. PCS contracts provide planned and corrective maintenance services, software updates, bug fixes, as well as call-center support. Service revenue is generated primarily from PCS (warranty period services and post warranty services), installation services, training, parts and upgrades that are sold under service contracts and professional services. PCS revenue is deferred and recognized over the service period. Installation service revenue is recognized concurrent with system revenue. Training and professional service revenues that are not deemed essential to the functionality of the systems are recognized as such services are performed.    Costs associated with service revenue are expensed when incurred, except when those costs are related to parts or system upgrades where revenue recognition has been deferred. In those cases, the costs are deferred and are recognized over the period of revenue recognition.    Net Loss Per Common Share    Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.    7           A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share follows (in thousands):       The potentially dilutive shares of the Company s common stock resulting from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the vesting of Restricted Stock Units (RSU), Market Stock Units (MSU) and Performance Stock Units (PSU), and the purchase of shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP), as determined under the treasury stock method, are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Additionally, the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due August1, 2016 (the  3.75% Convertible Notes ), the 3.50% Convertible Senior Notes due February1, 2018 (the  3.50% Convertible Notes ) and the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes (the  3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes ) due February1, 2018 (together, the  Convertible Notes ) are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share only if their inclusion is dilutive. For the three months ended December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, the potentially dilutive shares under the Convertible Notes were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. The following table sets forth all potentially dilutive securities excluded from the computation in the table above because their effect would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands):       Outstanding Convertible Notes Diluted Share Impact    The 3.75% Convertible Notes and 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes have an optional physical (share), cash or combination settlement feature and contain certain conditional conversion features. Due to the optional cash settlement feature and management s intent to settle the principal amount thereof in cash, the conversion shares underlying the outstanding principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Notes and the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes, totaling approximately 10.6million shares and 13.2million shares, respectively, were not included in the potentially diluted share count table above. The Company s average stock price did not exceed the conversion price of the 3.75% Convertible Notes as of December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2.8 and 3.9million potentially dilutive shares of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes as of December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, included in the table above represent the premium over the principal amount due to the higher average share price above the conversion price. The number of premium shares included in the Company s diluted share count will vary with fluctuations in the Company s share price. Higher actual share prices result in a greater number of premium shares.    Segment Information    The Company has determined that it operates in only one segment, as it only reports profit and loss information on an aggregate basis to its chief operating decision maker. Revenue by geographic region is based on the shipping addresses of the Company s customers. The following summarizes revenue by geographic region (in thousands):       8           Information regarding geographic areas in which the Company has long lived tangible assets is as follows (in thousands):       2. Balance Sheet Components    Financing receivables    A financing receivable is a contractual right to receive money, on demand or on fixed or determinable dates, that is recognized as an asset in the Company s balance sheet. The Company s financing receivables, consisting of its accounts receivable with contractual maturities of more than one year, totaled $8.1million and $1.6million at December31, 2015 and June30, 2015, respectively, and are included in Other Assets in the consolidated balance sheets. There was no balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to such financing receivables as of December31, 2015 and June30, 2015, respectively, as revenue is recognized on a cash basis for these receivables.    Inventories    Inventories consisted of the following (in thousands):       Property and equipment, net    Property and equipment, net consisted of the following (inthousands):       Depreciation expense related to property and equipment for the three and six months ended December31, 2015 was $2.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively. Depreciation expense related to property and equipment for the three and six months ended December31, 2014 was $3.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively .    9           3. Goodwill and Intangible Assets    Goodwill    Activity related to goodwill consisted of the following (in thousands):       In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test. Based on this analysis, the Company determined that there was no impairment to goodwill. The Company will continue to monitor its recorded goodwill for indicators of impairment.    Intangible Assets    The Company s unamortized intangible assets associated with completed acquisitions at December31, 2015 and June30, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):       The Company did not identify any triggering events that would indicate potential impairment of its definite-lived intangible and long-lived assets as of December31, 2015 and June30, 2015.    Amortization expense related to intangible assets for the three and six months ended December31, 2015 was $2.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively. Amortization expense related to intangible assets for the three and six months ended December31, 2014 was $2.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively.    The estimated future amortization expense of purchased intangible assets as of December31, 2015 is as follows (in thousands):       4. Financial Instruments    The Company considers all highly liquid investments held at major banks, certificates of deposit and other securities with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.    The Company classifies all of its investments as available-for-sale at the time of purchase because it is management s intent that these investments are available for current operations and includes these investments on its balance sheet as short-term investments. Investments with original maturities longer than three months include commercial paper, U.S. agency securities, non-U.S. government securities and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a    10           component of stockholders  equity. Realized gains and losses are recorded based on specific identification of each security s cost basis.    The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy contains three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, as follows:    Level1  Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.    Level2  Other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly or indirectly, including:       Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;     Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets;     Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and     Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data.    Level3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and require the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions.    The following tables summarize the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value by significant investment category for cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (in thousands):       11              The Company s Level2 investments in the table above are classified as Level2 items because quoted prices in an active market are not readily accessible for those specific financial assets, or the Company may have relied on alternative pricing methods that do not rely exclusively on quoted prices to determine the fair value of the investments.    The Company had investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December31, 2015. The Company determined that (i)it does not have the intent to sell any of these investments and (ii)it is not likely that it will be required to sell any of these investments before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. The Company reviews its investments quarterly to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible impairment. As of December31, 2015, the Company anticipates that it will recover the entire carrying value of such investments and has determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the six months ended December31, 2015.    Contractual maturities of available-for-sale securities at December31, 2015 were as follows (inthousands):       The following table summarizes the carrying values and estimated fair values of our short-term and long-term debt (in thousands):       The short-term and long-term debt is measured on a non-recurring basis using Level 2 inputs based upon observable inputs of the Company s underlying stock price and the time value of the conversion option, since an observable quoted price of the Convertible Notes is not readily available.    5. Commitments and Contingencies    The Company s contractual obligations were presented in the Annual Report on Form10-K for the previous annual reporting period ended June30, 2015. There have been no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business in those obligations during the three months ended December31, 2015.    12           Litigation    From time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. The Company records a provision for a loss when it believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Currently, management believes the Company does not have any probable and estimable losses related to any current legal proceedings and claims. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, except as described in the matters below, management does not believe that an adverse determination with respect to any of these claims would individually or in the aggregate materially and adversely affect the Company s financial condition or operating results. For certain legal proceedings, management believes that there is a reasonable possibility that material losses may be incurred; however, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible losses with respect to these matters. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company s control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, the Company could incur significant charges related to legal matters that could have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position and cash flows.    Rotary Systems    On April28, 2011, a former supplier to TomoTherapy, Rotary Systems Incorporated ( Rotary Systems ), filed suit in Minnesota state court, Tenth Judicial District, Anoka County, against TomoTherapy alleging misappropriation of trade secrets, as well as several other counts alleging various theories of injury. Rotary Systems alleges TomoTherapy misappropriated Rotary Systems  trade secrets pertaining to a component previously purchased from Rotary Systems, which TomoTherapy now purchases from a different supplier. The suit alleges TomoTherapy improperly supplied the alleged trade secrets to its present supplier, Dynamic Sealing TechnologiesInc. (also a named defendant in the suit). Rotary Systems has made an unspecified claim for damages of greater than $50,000. TomoTherapy moved to dismiss the case and, on August29, 2011, the court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to all counts other than the count alleging misappropriation of trade secrets. On May21, 2012, the court gave Rotary Systems sixty days to identify the alleged trade secrets with specificity or face dismissal of its claim with prejudice. The court held a hearing on September20, 2012 to review Rotary Systems  amended complaint. TomoTherapy filed a motion for summary judgment on the trade secret claim, the court ruled in favor of TomoTherapy on December5, 2013, and Rotary Systems appealed. On December22, 2014, the Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed the district court s dismissal of Rotary Systems  trade secrets claim and remanded it to the district court but affirmed the dismissal of Rotary Systems  other claims. In late October2015, a final scheduling order was confirmed for the remanded claims and the parties are currently in the process of conducting discovery.    Cowealth Medical    On February27, 2014, Cowealth Medical HoldingCo.,Ltd. ( Cowealth ), Accuray s former distributor in China, submitted a request for binding arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce International Court of Arbitration ( ICC ) alleging, among other matters, that Accuray breached its distributor agreement with Cowealth by wrongfully terminating Cowealth as its distributor and misappropriated certain of Cowealth s confidential information. Cowealth was seeking damages of approximately $170.0 million and injunctive relief. Accuray filed counterclaims for damages of approximately $35.0 million. Accuray s answer and counterclaim were submitted to the ICC on May12, 2014, and Cowealth served its reply on June27, 2014. A hearing was held in Hong Kong between January26, 2015 and February6, 2015. The parties filed closing submissions and reply closing submissions in March2015. On October29, 2015, the ICC ruled that Accuray was liable for certain damages and awarded Cowealth approximately $3.4 million. On November 27, 2015, Cowealth applied for a correction to the award to revise the amount of damages upwards to approximately $5.5 million. On January 21, 2016, the arbitrator granted Cowealth s application for a correction on the grounds that the original award amount was a clerical error on the part of the arbitrator. Interest on the final award amount will accrue at a rate of 5% per annum starting 30 days after the date the corrected award was issued until payment. Accordingly, management recorded a charge of $3.4 million for the first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2015, and an additional $2.1 million for the second fiscal quarter ending December 30, 2015. The parties filed cost submissions and reply cost submissions in December 2015. The ICC will subsequently issue a separate ruling as to legal costs and associated expenses; however, management does not believe the likelihood of an award of legal fees to Cowealth is probable or estimable as of December 31, 2015, so no additional amount has been recorded. Prior to the ruling of the ICC, no accrual was established in the Company s consolidated financial statements because management did not believe the likelihood of an award of damages to Cowealth was probable or estimable. In addition, the Company won several of its counterclaims including the right to be assigned the existing service contracts between Cowealth and Accuray customers, transfer to Accuray any regulatory clearances, licenses or permits obtained and held for the purposes of selling the CyberKnife System in China and deliver any consigned parts in their possession.    Software License Indemnity    Under the terms of the Company s software license agreements with its customers, the Company agrees that in the event the software sold infringes upon any patent, copyright, trademark, or any other proprietary right of a third-party, it will indemnify its    13           customer licensees against any loss, expense, or liability from any damages that may be awarded against its customer. The Company includes this infringement indemnification in all of its software license agreements and selected managed services arrangements. In the event the customer cannot use the software or service due to infringement and the Company cannot obtain the right to use, replace or modify the license or service in a commercially feasible manner so that it no longer infringes, then the Company may terminate the license and provide the customer a refund of the fees paid by the customer for the infringing license or service. The Company has not recorded any liability associated with this indemnification, as it is not aware of any pending or threatened actions that represent probable losses as of December31, 2015.    6. Share-Based Compensation    The following table summarizes the share-based compensation charges included in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):       7. Debt    3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due August2016    On August1, 2011, the Company issued the 3.75% Convertible Notes to certain qualified institutional buyers, or QIBs. The 3.75% Convertible Notes were offered and sold to the QIBs pursuant to Rule144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), or Rule144A. The net proceeds from the $100million offering, after deducting the initial purchaser s discount and commission and the related offering costs, were approximately $96.1million. The offering costs and the initial purchaser s discount and commission (which are recorded in Other Assets) are both being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over five years. The 3.75% Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.75% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on February1 and August1 of each year, beginning on February1, 2012. The 3.75% Convertible Notes will mature on August1, 2016, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. A portion of these notes were redeemed in January2016, as noted in Note 9 below.    The 3.75% Convertible Notes were issued under an Indenture between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Holders of the 3.75% Convertible Notes may convert their 3.75% Convertible Notes at any time on or after May1, 2016 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. Prior to May1, 2016, holders of the 3.75% Convertible Notes may convert their 3.75% Convertible Notes only under the following circumstances: (1)during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending September30, 2011, and only during such calendar quarter, if the closing sale price of the Company s common stock for each of 20 or more trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2)during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading-day period (such five consecutive trading-day period, the  Note Measurement Period ) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Notes for each trading day of that Note Measurement Period was equal to or less than 98% of the product of the closing sale price of shares of the Company s common stock and the applicable conversion rate for such trading day; (3)if the Company calls any or all of the 3.75% Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4)upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions as described in the Indenture. Upon conversion by holders of the 3.75% Convertible Notes, the Company will have the right to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock of the Company or a combination thereof, at the Company s election. At any time on or prior to the 33rdbusiness day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Company may irrevocably elect to (a)deliver solely shares of common stock of the Company in respect of the Company s conversion obligation or (b)pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock of the Company or a combination thereof in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Notes being converted. The initial conversion rate is 105.5548 shares of the Company s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $9.47 per share of the Company s common stock). The conversion rate, and thus the conversion price, are subject to adjustment as further described below.    14           Holders of the 3.75% Convertible Notes who convert their 3.75% Convertible Notes in connection with a  make-whole fundamental change,  as defined in the Indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a  fundamental change,  as defined in the Indenture, holders of the 3.75% Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their 3.75% Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date.    Prior to the maturity date, the Company may redeem for cash all or a portion of the 3.75% Convertible Notes if the closing sale price of its common stock exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price (the initial conversion price is approximately $9.47 per share of common stock) of such 3.75% Convertible Notes for at least 20 trading days during any consecutive 30trading-day period (including the last trading day of such period).    In accordance with ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, the Company separately accounts for the liability and equity conversion components of the 3.75% Convertible Notes. The principal amount of the liability component of the 3.75% Convertible Notes was $75.9million as of the date of issuance based on the present value of its cash flows using a discount rate of 10%, our approximate borrowing rate at the date of the issuance for a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature. The carrying value of the equity conversion component was $24.1million. A portion of the initial purchaser s discount and commission and the offering costs totaling $0.9million was allocated to the equity conversion component. The liability component is being accreted to the principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Notes using the effective interest method over five years. A portion of these notes were repurchased in January2016, please refer to Note 9 below.    3.50% Convertible Senior Notes due February2018    In February2013, the Company issued $115.0million aggregate principal amount of its 3.50% Convertible Notes to certain QIBs. The 3.50% Convertible Notes were offered and sold to the QIBs pursuant to Rule144A. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the initial purchaser s discount and commission and the related offering costs, were approximately $110.5million. The offering costs and the initial purchaser s discount and commission (which are recorded in Other Assets) are both being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over five years. The 3.50% Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on February1 and August1 of each year, which began on August1, 2013. The 3.50% Convertible Notes will mature on February1, 2018, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted.    In April2014, through a series of transactions, the Company refinanced approximately $70.3million aggregate principal amount of the 3.50% Convertible Notes with approximately $70.3million aggregate principal amount of the Company s new 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the  3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes ).    The 3.50% Convertible Notes were issued under an Indenture between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Holders of the 3.50% Convertible Notes may convert their 3.50% Convertible Notes at any time until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. The 3.50% Convertible Notes are convertible, as described below into common stock of the Company at an initial conversion rate equal to 187.6877 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.50% Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $5.33 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment.    Holders of the 3.50% Convertible Notes who convert their 3.50% Convertible Notes in connection with a  make-whole fundamental change , as defined in the Indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a  fundamental change,  as defined in the Indenture, holders of the 3.50% Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their 3.50% Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of 3.50% Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date.    In accordance with guidance in ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options and ASC815-15, Embedded Derivatives, the Company determined that the embedded conversion components of the 3.50% Convertible Note do not require bifurcation and separate accounting. The remaining $44.7million principal amount of the 3.50% Convertible Note has been recorded in Long-term Debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2015.    3.50% SeriesA Convertible Senior Notes due February2018    On April17, 2014, the Company entered into note exchange agreements with certain holders (the  Participating Holders ) of the 3.50% Convertible Notes to refinance approximately $70.3million aggregate principal amount of the 3.50% Convertible Notes    15           with approximately $70.3million aggregate principal amount of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes. Pursuant to the note exchange agreements, the Company also paid the Participating Holders an aggregate of approximately $0.4million in cash in connection with such transactions. The principal amount of 3.50% Convertible Notes refinanced for each $1,000 principal amount of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes was $1,000 and the amount in cash paid per $1,000 principal amount of such 3.50% Convertible Notes delivered was determined in individual negotiations between the Company and each Participating Holder. The SeriesA Convertible Notes have the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as the 3.50% Convertible Notes, except that the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes are convertible into cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company s option.    The 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes were issued under an Indenture between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Holders of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes may convert their Securities at any time on or after November1, 2017 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. Prior to November1, 2017, holders of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes may convert their Securities only under the following circumstances: (1)during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending September30, 2014, and only during such calendar quarter, if the closing sale price of the Company s common stock for each of 20 or more trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2)during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading-day period (such five consecutive trading-day period, the  Note Measurement Period ) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes for each trading day of that Securities Measurement Period was equal to or less than 98% of the product of the closing sale price of shares of the Company s common stock and the applicable conversion rate for such trading day; or (3)upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions as described in the Indenture. Upon conversion by holders of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes, the Company will have the right to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock of the Company or a combination thereof, at the Company s election. At any time on or prior to the 17thbusiness day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Company may irrevocably elect to (a)deliver solely shares of common stock of the Company in respect of the Company s conversion obligation or (b)pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock of the Company or a combination thereof in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes being converted. The initial conversion rate is 187.6877 shares of the Company s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $5.33 per share of the Company s common stock). The conversion rate, and thus the conversion price, are subject to adjustment as further described below.    Holders of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a  make-whole fundamental change , as defined in the Indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a  fundamental change,  as defined in the Indenture, holders of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their 3.50% Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date.    In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, the Company separately accounts for the liability and equity conversion components of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes. The principal amount of the liability component of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes was $62.5million as of the date of issuance based on the present value of its cash flows using a discount rate of 7%, our approximate borrowing rate at the date of the issuance for a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature. The carrying value of the equity conversion component was $7.9million. In addition, the portion of the cash amount paid to the Participating Holders totaling $0.4 million was allocated to the debt discount with the remaining $47,000 to the equity component. The liability component is being accreted to the principal amount of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes using the effective interest method through the maturity in February2018.    The following table presents the carrying values of all Convertible Notes as of December31, 2015 (in thousands):       16           A summary of interest expense on the Convertible Notes is as follows (in thousands):       8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss    The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss consist of net loss, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, changes in foreign currency exchange rate translation and net changes related to defined benefit pension plan. These components are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of stockholders  equity. The foreign currency translation adjustment results from those subsidiaries not using the United States dollar as their functional currency since the majority of their economic activities are primarily denominated in their applicable local currency. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities related to these operations are translated at the current exchange rates at the end of each period. The resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded directly to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account in stockholders  equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the period.    The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the equity section of the balance sheets are as follows (in thousands):       9. Subsequent Events    New Debt Financing    On January11, 2016, the Company closed a $70.0 million straight debt financing agreement with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P (the  Financing Agreement ). The net proceeds of the loan are required to be used, in addition to $30.0 million of cash funded by the Company, to retire $100.0 million of convertible notes at the earlier of August2016 or when otherwise redeemed. This financing consists of a $70.0 million first lien senior secured term loan with a 700 basis point margin and 1 percent LIBOR floor. The loan will be amortized at an effective rate of 5% annually with final payment due in 5 years and is subject to certain maintenance-based covenants. The covenants in the Financing Agreement include:       Secured leverage  defines the maximum amount of secured leverage that can be on the Company s books at a given point in time calculated by the total secured debt divided by the last twelve months  adjusted EBITDA;     Total leverage  defines the maximum amount of total leverage that can be on the Company s books at a given point in time calculated by the total debt divided by the last twelve months  adjusted EBITDA;     Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio   designed to ensure that the Company s cash fixed charges are met with adequate free cash flow based on a minimum coverage ratio to be set and maintained;     Minimum EBITDA   defines the minimum amount of adjusted EBITDA the Company must maintain and generate;     Maximum CapEx   defines how much cash the Company can use annually to pursue capital projects, purchase PP&amp;E and other related activities during the life of the loan; and     Affirmative and negative covenants   defining reporting requirements, subsidiary asset restrictions, dividend distribution and repayment requirements among other general requirements.    3.75% Convertible Senior Notes partial Repurchase    In January2016, the Company repurchased approximately $63.4 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due August2016 for $66.6 million in cash. As $63.4 million of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes were settled in cash, a total of 6.7 million potentially dilutive shares are no longer potentially outstanding from an EPS perspective, these shares were already noted in Note 1 above as being excluded due to being anti-dilutive in the current fiscal quarter of 2016. Following such transactions, approximately $44.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.50% Convertible Notes, approximately $36.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Notes and approximately $70.3 million of the 3.50% SeriesA Convertible Notes remained outstanding. The Company expects to record a charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 of approximately $1.0 million associated with the repurchase of the notes.    Cowealth Medical Litigation    In Februaryof 2014, Cowealth submitted a request for binding arbitration with the ICC alleging, among other matters, that Accuray breached its distributor agreement with Cowealth by wrongfully terminating Cowealth as its distributor and misappropriated certain of Cowealth s confidential information. Cowealth was seeking damages of approximately $170.0 million and injunctive relief. On October29, 2015, the ICC ruled that Accuray was liable for certain damages and awarded Cowealth approximately $3.4 million, while denying Cowealth s claim for injunctive relief.    On November27, 2015, Cowealth applied for a correction to the award dated October29, 2015, to revise the amount of damages upwards to approximately $5.5 million from the previously issued award of $3.4 million. On January21, 2016, the arbitrator granted Cowealth s application for a correction on the grounds that the original award amount was a clerical error on the part of the arbitrator. As the legal matter arose before December31, 2015, management recorded the additional charge of $2.1 million into accrued liabilities and general and administrative expenses. After the initial award assessment of $3.4 million in October2015, no additional accrual had been recorded in the Company s consolidated financial statements because management did not believe the likelihood of an additional award of damages to Cowealth was probable or estimable. Under the terms of the ICC Rules of Arbitration all awards are binding and cannot be appealed by either party. Further issues relating to costs remain to be finalized in the arbitration, none of which will affect the binding outcome under the interim and corrected award. The ICC will subsequently issue a separate ruling as to legal costs and associated expenses; however, management does not believe the likelihood of an award of legal fees to Cowealth is probable or estimable as of the date of the financials, so no additional amount has been recorded.    17

In this report,  Accuray,  the  Company,   we,   us,  and  our  refer to Accuray Incorporated and its subsidiaries.    18           Overview    Products and Markets    We are a radiation oncology company that develops, manufactures, sells and supports precise, innovative treatment solutions which set the standard of care, with the aim of helping patients live longer, better lives. Our leading edge technologies, the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy Systems, are designed to deliver advanced radiation therapy including radiosurgery, stereotactic body radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy, image-guided radiation therapy and adaptive radiation therapy tailored to the specific needs of each patient. The CyberKnife and TomoTherapy Systems are complementary offerings serving separate patient populations treated by the same medical specialty, radiation oncology, with advanced capabilities that offer increased treatment flexibility to meet the needs of an expanding patient population.    The CyberKnife Systems are robotic systems designed to deliver radiosurgery treatments to cancer tumors anywhere in the body. The CyberKnife Systems are the only dedicated, full-body robotic radiosurgery systems on the market. Radiosurgery is an alternative to traditional surgery for tumors and is performed on an outpatient basis in one to five treatment sessions. It enables the treatment of patients who otherwise would not be treated with radiation, who may not be good candidates for surgery, or who desire non-surgical treatments. The use of radiosurgery with CyberKnife Systems to treat tumors throughout the body has grown significantly in recent years, but currently only a small portion of the patients who develop tumors treatable with CyberKnife Systems are treated with these systems. A determination of when it may or may not be appropriate to use a CyberKnife System for treatment is at the discretion of the treating physician and depends on the specific patient. However, the CyberKnife Systems are generally not used to treat (1)very large tumors, which are considerably wider than the radiation beam that can be delivered by CyberKnife Systems, (2)diffuse wide-spread disease, as is often the case for late stage cancers, because they are not localized (though CyberKnife Systems might be used to treat a focal area of the disease) and (3)systemic diseases, like leukemia and lymphoma, which are not localized to an organ, but rather involve cells throughout the body. The addition of the multi-leaf collimator, or InCise MLC, now makes it faster and more efficient to treat a wider range of tumor types with the CyberKnife M6, including larger tumors and those with multiple sites of disease.    Our CyberKnife M6 SeriesSystems have the option of: fixed collimator, iris collimator and/or InCise MLC. The InCise MLC is designed specifically for the M6 Series. With the addition of the InCise MLC, clinicians can deliver the same precise radiosurgery treatments they have come to expect with the CyberKnife System, faster and for a wider range of tumor types. The InCise MLC was commercially launched in the third fiscal quarter of 2015.    We believe the long term success of the CyberKnife Systems is dependent on a number of factors including the following:       Continued adoption of our CyberKnife M6 Series Systems;       Production and shipment of MLC that meets the standards that we, and our customers, expect in our products;       Change in medical practice leading to utilization of stereotactic body radiosurgery more regularly as an alternative to surgery or other treatments;       Greater awareness among doctors and patients of the benefits of radiosurgery with the CyberKnife Systems;       Continued evolution in clinical studies demonstrating the safety, efficacy and other benefits of using the CyberKnife Systems to treat tumors in various parts of the body;       Continued advances in our technology that improve the quality of treatments and ease of use of the CyberKnife Systems;       Receipt of regulatory approvals in various countries which is expected to improve access to radiosurgery with the CyberKnife Systems in such countries;       Medical insurance reimbursement policies that cover CyberKnife System treatments; and       Our ability to expand sales of CyberKnife Systems in countries throughout the world.    The TomoTherapy Systems are advanced, fully integrated and versatile radiation therapy systems for the treatment of a wide range of cancer types. The TomoTherapy Systems are the only radiation therapy systems designed for image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT). The TomoTherapy H SeriesSystems come in configurations of TomoH TM , TomoHD TM  and    19           TomoHDA TM . Based on a CT scanner platform, the systems provide continuous delivery of radiation from 360 degrees around the patient, or delivery from clinician-specified beam angles. These unique features, combined with daily 3D image guidance, enable physicians to delivery highly accurate, individualized dose distributions which precisely conform to the shape of the patient s tumor while minimizing dose to normal, healthy tissue, resulting in fewer side effects for patients. The TomoTherapy Systems are capable of treating all standard radiation therapy indications including breast, prostate, lung and head and neck cancers, in addition to complex treatments such as total marrow irradiation. Radiation therapy has been widely available and used in developed countries for decades, though many developing countries do not currently have a sufficient number of radiation therapy systems to adequately treat their domestic cancer patient populations. The number of radiation therapy systems in use and sold each year is currently many times larger than the number of radiosurgery systems. We believe the TomoTherapy Systems offer clinicians and patients significant benefits over other radiation therapy systems in the market. We believe our ability to capture more sales will be influenced by a number of factors including the following:       Continued adoption of our TomoTherapy H Series Systems;       Greater awareness among doctors and patients of the benefits of radiation therapy using TomoTherapy Systems;       Advances in our technology which improve the quality of treatments and ease of use of TomoTherapy Systems;       Greater awareness among doctors of the now-established reliability of TomoTherapy Systems; and       Our ability to expand sales of TomoTherapy Systems in countries throughout the world.    Sale of Our Products    Generating revenue from the sale of our systems is a lengthy process. Selling our systems, from first contact with a potential customer to a signed sales contract that meets our backlog criteria (as discussed below) varies significantly and generally spans six months to two years. The time from receipt of a signed contract to revenue recognition is governed generally by the time required by the customer to build, renovate or prepare the treatment room for installation of the system.    In the United States, we primarily market directly to customers, including hospitals and stand-alone treatment facilities, through our sales organization and we also market to customers through sales agents and group purchasing organizations. Outside the United States, we market to customers directly and through distributors and some sales agents. In addition to our offices in the United States, we have sales and service offices in many countries in Europe, Japan and other countries in Asia, South America, and throughout the world.    Backlog    For orders that cover both products and services, only the portion of the order that is recognizable as product revenue is reported as backlog. The portion of the order that is recognized as service revenue (for example, Post Contract Customer Support (PCS), installation, training and professional services) is not included in reported backlog. Product backlog totaled $366.7million as of December31, 2015.    In order for the product portion of a CyberKnife or TomoTherapy System sales agreement to be counted as backlog, it must meet the following criteria:       The contract is signed and properly executed by both the customer and us. A customer purchase order that is signed and incorporates the terms of our contract quote will be considered equivalent to a signed and executed contract;       The contract is non-contingent - it either has cleared all its contingencies or contains no contingencies when signed;       We have received a minimum deposit or a letter of credit; the sale is a direct channel sale to a government entity, or the product has shipped to a customer with credit sufficient to cover the minimum deposit;       The specific end customer site has been identified by the customer in the written contract or written amendment;       For orders in our Latin America region, unless the system has already shipped and collection is reasonably assured, we request supporting evidence that the end customer has commenced construction to place our products if a site does not already exist; and    20              Less than 2.5 years have passed since the contract met all the criteria above.    Although our backlog includes only contractual agreements with our customers for the purchase of CyberKnife Systems, TomoTherapy Systems and related upgrades, due to factors outside of our control, we cannot provide assurance that we will convert backlog into recognized revenue. The amount of backlog recognized into revenue is primarily impacted by three items: cancellations, age-outs and foreign currency fluctuations. Orders could be cancelled for reasons including, without limitation, changes in customers  needs or financial condition, changes in government or health insurance reimbursement policies, changes to regulatory requirements, or other reasons. In addition to cancellations, after 2.5 years, if we have not been able to recognize revenue on a contract, we remove the revenue associated with the contract from backlog and the order is considered aged out. Contracts may age-out for many reasons, including inability of the customer to pay, inability of the customer to adapt their facilities to accommodate our products in a timely manner, inability to timely obtain licenses necessary for customer facilities or operation of our equipment among other reasons for delays. Our backlog also includes amounts not denominated in U.S. Dollars and therefore fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar as compared to other currencies will impact backlog. Generally, strengthening in the U.S. Dollar will negatively impact backlog.    Gross orders are defined as the sum of new orders recorded during the period adjusted for any revisions to existing orders during the period. Net product orders are defined as gross product orders less cancellations, age-outs and foreign exchange adjustments.       Gross orders decreased by $5.2 million for the three months ended December31, 2015, as compared to the three months ended December31, 2014. This was a result of a decrease of $4.2 million in new system order volume added as the total number of system orders decreased from the same prior year period. The TomoTherapy System order volume decreased in this period partially offset by an increase in orders for the CyberKnife System fueled by the demand for the MLC, introduced in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The remaining change was a result of fewer upgrade orders added in the three months ended December31, 2015 as compared to the same prior year period.    Gross orders increased by $1.0 million for the six months ended December31, 2015, as compared to the six months ended December31, 2014. This was a result of increased CyberKnife System order volume as compared to the same prior year period, partially offset by a slight decrease in TomoTherapy System order volume. The increase in CyberKnife System orders is in line with of the increased demand for systems with the MLC, after its introduction in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The majority of new orders added for CyberKnife Systems this period were for systems with the MLC.    Net orders increased by $1.2 million for the three months ended December31, 2015, as compared to the three months ended December31, 2014, resulting from $3.9 million of fewer cancellations and more favorable currency impact causing an increase of $3.4 million compared to the same period in prior year. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in gross orders of $5.2 million and a slight increase in age-outs of $0.9 million as compared to the same period in the prior year.       Age-outs were $19.1 million and $18.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The age-outs of $19.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 resulted from the age-out of two additional systems as compared to the prior year period.       Cancellations were $3.0 million and $6.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cancellations are outside of our control and difficult to forecast; however, we continue to work closely with our customers to minimize the impact of cancellations on our business.       Currency impacts resulted in decreases in net orders of $2.3 million and $5.8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.    Net orders increased by $13.7 million for the six months ended December31, 2015, as compared to the six months ended December31, 2014, resulting from the increase in gross orders of $1.0 million plus an increase of $10.8 million due to foreign currency impacts and an increase of $3.5 million due to fewer cancellations. These increases were partially offset by higher age-outs resulting in a decrease of $1.6 million.    21              Age-outs were $37.5 million and $35.9 million in the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The age-outs of $37.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2015 include $5.3 million of age-ins which represent orders that previously aged-out but have been taken to revenue in the current period. There were no age-ins included in the age-out number for the six months ended December 31, 2014.       Cancellations were $6.0 million and $9.5 million in the six months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cancellations are outside of our control and difficult to forecast; however, we continue to work closely with our customers to minimize the impact of cancellations on our business.       Currency impacts resulted in decreases in net orders of $1.1 million and $11.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.    Currently, we expect age-outs in the third quarter of this fiscal year to be in the range of $5.0 to $8.0 million as compared to $11.6 million in age-outs recorded during the three months ended March31, 2015. Between fiscal 2013 and 2015, we made changes to our order taking process, including increased oversight responsibility for and management of distributors and changes in timing as to when we enter some of our distributor orders into backlog. We believe these changes will improve the quality of backlog over time and reduce the level of age-outs.    Results of Operations   Three and six months ended December31, 2015 and 2014        (a)  Expressed as a percentage of total net revenue, except for product and services gross profits which are expressed as a percentage of related product and services revenue.    Net Revenue    Product Net Revenue . Product net revenue increased by $8.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase of $9.2 million in new system revenue due to an increase in the number of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems taken to revenue in the current period as compared to the prior year period. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in upgrade and other revenue as compared to the prior year period.    Product net revenue increased by $15.1 million for the six months ended December31, 2015, as compared to the six months ended December31, 2014, primarily due to an increase of $14.3 million in new system revenue due to an increase in the number of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems taken to revenue in the current period as compared to the prior year period. In addition, there was an increase of $0.8 million in upgrade and other revenue as compared to the prior year period.    22           Services Net Revenue . Services net revenue increased by $2.6 million and $2.9 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2015, respectively, as compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2014, respectively. The increase in services net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in training revenue due to the timing of the expiration of training points; however, we don t expect training revenue from expired points to be at this volume going forward.    Percentage of net revenue by geographic region, based on the shipping location of our customers, is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):       Revenue derived from sales outside of the Americas region was $57.9 million and $52.4 million for the three months ended December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and represented 53% and 53% of our net revenue during these periods, respectively. Revenue derived from sales outside of the Americas region was $102.3 million and $96.3 million for the six months ended December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and represented 51% and 53% of our net revenue during these periods .    Gross Profit    Overall gross profit for the three months ended December31, 2015, increased $4.1 million, or 11%, as compared to the three months ended December31, 2014. Product gross profit increased 13%, or $2.6 million, primarily due to the increase in systems taken to revenue resulting in a higher profit margin due to increased leveraging of certain fixed costs. Service gross profit increased 8%, or $1.5 million, as a result of higher service revenues of $2.6 million driven by increased training revenue, partially offset by higher service costs of $1.1 million mainly due to higher part consumption as compared to prior fiscal year.    Overall gross profit for the six months ended December31, 2015, increased $10.2 million, or 15%, as compared to the six months ended December31, 2014. Product gross profit increased 22%, or $7.2 million, primarily due to the increase in systems taken to revenue which resulted in a higher profit margin due to increased leverage of certain fixed costs. Service gross profit increased 9%, or $3.0 million, as a result of higher service revenues of $2.9 million driven by increased training revenue and lower service costs of $0.1 million.    Research and Development    Research and development expenses were $14.9 million in the three months ended December31, 2015 as compared to $13.9 million in the three months ended December31, 2014, which represents an increase of $1.0 million, or 7%. The increase was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in consulting fees as a result of several new development projects that started in late fiscal 2015 and early fiscal 2016, partially offset by decreased compensation related expenses of $0.5 million due to lower headcount as compared with the prior fiscal period.    Research and development expenses were $29.2 million in the six months ended December31, 2015 as compared to $28.1 million in the six months ended December31, 2014, which represents an increase of $1.1 million, or 4%. The increase was primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in consulting fees as a result of a development project that started in the third fiscal quarter of 2015. This increase was partially offset by decreased headcount related expenses of $1.5 million due to lower headcount as compared with prior period and a decrease in materials and supplies expenses of $0.5 million due to several large research and development projects completed prior to fiscal year 2016.    Selling and Marketing    Selling and marketing expenses for the three months ended December31, 2015 were $15.1 million as compared to $15.8 million for the three months ended December31, 2014, which represents a decrease of $0.7 million, or 4%. The decrease is primarily due to a $1.4 million reduction in headcount related expense resulting mainly from a $1.0 million reduction in commission expense due to several revenue deals with greater commission expense in the prior year as commission amount can vary from deal to deal and decreased salaries and benefits of $0.4 million due to lower headcount. In addition there were decreased travel expenses of $0.2 million also due to the lower headcount. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $0.9 million in marketing related    23           expenses driven mainly by the timing and location of the ASTRO tradeshow which took place in the second fiscal quarter of 2016 whereas it took place in the first fiscal quarter of 2015.    Selling and marketing expenses for the six months ended December31, 2015 were $28.5 million as compared to $33.8 million for the six months ended December31, 2014, which represents a decrease of $5.3 million, or 16%. The decrease is primarily due to a $2.4 million reduction in headcount related expenses resulting mainly from lower commissions of $1.5 million due to several revenue deals with greater commission expense in the prior year and decreased salaries and benefits of $0.7 million related to lower headcount. Travel expenses also decreased by $0.6 million due to lower headcount in the sales and marketing departments. General marketing expenses also decreased by $0.9 million due to lower trade show expenses mainly for the ASTRO tradeshow due to location. In addition, consulting fees decreased by $0.8 million due to fewer marketing initiative projects as compared to the prior year. Lastly, there were reductions of $0.3 million in IT and facilities allocated expenses related to revised allocation rates and headcount in fiscal year 2016, and $0.3 million reduction in general sales and marketing expenses related to software maintenance, business promotion and subscriptions.    General and Administrative    General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December31, 2015 were $12.7 million as compared to $12.4 million for the three months ended December31, 2014, which represents an increase of $0.3 million, or 3%. This increase was mainly attributable to higher legal fees associated with the additional Cowealth settlement in the second fiscal quarter of 2016 as described in Notes 5 and 9 to the financial statements.    General and administrative expenses for the six months ended December31, 2015 were $26.1 million as compared to $23.3 million for the six months ended December31, 2014, which represents an increase of $2.8 million, or 12%. The increase was related to higher legal fees of $2.7 million associated with the Cowealth settlement described in Note 5 to the financial statements. In addition, there were higher tax expenses of $0.3 million due to several tax write-offs in prior year as well as higher bad debt expense of $0.2 million resulting from bad debt recoveries in prior year; whereas, there were no similar offsetting tax write-offs or bad debt recoveries in the current fiscal year. These increases were partially offset by lower consulting expenses of $0.4 million due to fewer projects with general and administrative involvement.    Other Expense, net    Other expense, net for the three months ended December31, 2015 was $5.1 million as compared to $5.5 million for the three months ended December31, 2014, which represents a decrease of $0.4 million, or 7%. Foreign currency losses decreased by $1.1 million despite the fact that the U.S. Dollar continued to strengthen in comparison to the EURO, Japanese Yen and the Swiss Franc, because more sales agreements and related receivables outside of the U.S. were denominated in U.S. Dollar than in the same period of the previous year. This increase was partially offset by losses on hedging activities of $0.5 million as compared to the same period in prior year due to increased hedging activities in the current year and month-to-month volatility of the Swiss Franc against the U.S. Dollar as well as higher interest expense of $0.2 million due to continued debt discount accretion.    Other expense, net for the six months ended December31, 2015 was $10.2 million as compared to $11.0 million for the six months ended December31, 2014, which represents a decrease of $0.8 million, or 7%. Foreign currency losses decreased by $2.5 million despite the fact that the U.S. Dollar continued to strengthen in comparison to the EURO, Japanese Yen and the Swiss Franc, because more sales agreements and related receivables outside of the U.S. were denominated in U.S. Dollar than in the same period of the previous year. This increase was partially offset by losses on hedging activities of $1.3 million as compared to the same period in prior year due to increased hedging activities in the current year and month-to-month volatility of the Swiss Franc against the U.S. Dollar as well as higher interest expense of $0.4 million due to continued debt discount accretion.    Provision for Income Taxes    On a quarterly basis, the Company provides for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. Income tax expenses were $0.8 million and $1.5 million for the three and six months ended December31, 2015, respectively, compared to income tax expenses of $0.9 million and $1.8 million for the three and six months ended December31, 2014, respectively. The decrease in tax expense of $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three and six months ended December31, 2015, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended December31, 2014 was primarily related to a decrease in earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.    24           Liquidity and Capital Resources    At December31, 2015, we had $88.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $67.3 million in short-term investments, for a total of $155.8million. Refer to Note 7,  Debt  to the condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion of the Convertible Notes. Based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources and anticipated cash flows to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months.    As of December31, 2015, we had approximately $55.3 million of cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and unavailable for distribution in the form of dividends or otherwise. Accordingly, no provisions for U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon. We anticipate that we have adequate liquidity and capital resources for the next twelve months and do not anticipate the need to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at December31, 2015.    Our cash flows for the six months ended December31, 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows (in thousands):       Cash Flows From Operating Activities    Net cash provided by operating activities in the six months ended December31, 2015 was $20.3 million, as compared to $13.0 million used in operating activities in the six months ended December31, 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities in the six months ended December31, 2015 was primarily related to:       Net loss of $19.1 million;       Net loss was offset by non-cash items of $21.0 million related to depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, amortization and accretion of discount and premium on investments, amortization of debt issuance costs, accretion of interest on long-term debt, provision for doubtful accounts receivable and provision for excess and obsolete inventory;       Decrease in restricted cash of $1.0 million due to releases of restrictions on cash related to bunker constructions during the year;       Decrease in accounts receivable of $11.0 million as a result of collections on customer accounts in excess of billings resulting from significant sales transactions in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 that were collected in the first fiscal quarter of 2016, partially offset by a higher volume of invoicing as compared to payments in the second fiscal quarter of 2016;       Increase in inventories of $5.7 million due to increases in purchases in the first fiscal quarter of 2016 to support expected future sales and service needs that began to be utilized in the second fiscal quarter of 2016;       Increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $3.6 million primarily due to an increase in long-term accounts receivable of $6.5 million due to several large revenue contracts with extended payment terms. This was partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million due to the settlement of value-add taxes in foreign locations, reduction of other prepaids of $0.7 million due to the release of vendor advances and amortization of prepayments for the ASTRO tradeshow offset by new additions, and a reduction in prepaid benefit costs of $0.8 million due to the timing of payments;       Increase in deferred revenue of $5.9 million primarily due to additional product revenue deferrals added during the period in excess of the amount of deferred product revenue recognized;       Increase in deferred cost of revenue of $2.7 million primarily due to the timing of inventory transfers to customers;    25              Increase in accounts payable of $6.7 million primarily due to an increase in inventory purchasing activities in the first half of fiscal 2016 and timing of payments as there was more large value payment activity at the end of prior year as compared with the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2016;       Increase in accrued liabilities of $5.4 million primarily related to an increase in legal accrual of $5.7 million due to the award of damages related to the Cowealth litigation as described in Footnotes 5 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements as well as an increase in the bonus accrual of $1.1 million for the first half of fiscal 2016. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenue related accruals of $1.4 million due to the timing of payments; and       Increase in customer advances of $0.3 million due mainly to payments received for future revenue deliverables;    Net cash used in operating activities in the six months ended December31, 2014 was primarily related to:       Net loss of $31.6 million;       Net loss was offset by non-cash items of $22.5 million related to depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, amortization and accretion of discount and premium on investments, amortization of debt issuance costs, accretion of interest on long-term debt, recovery of doubtful accounts receivable and provision for excess and obsolete inventory;       Decrease in accounts receivable of $6.6 million as a result of collections on customer accounts in excess of billings;       Increase in inventories of $18.6 million due to increase in purchases to support expected future sales;       Decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.8 million primarily due to the reduction of prepaid taxes of $1.8 million primarily in foreign locations due to settlements, a reduction in debt related costs of $0.8 million due to continued amortization, and a decrease in prepaid commissions of $0.5 million due to the conversion of deferred revenue into revenue in the second fiscal quarter of 2015. The decrease was offset by an increase in the prepaid insurance balance of $0.5 million due to the timing of payments;       Increase in deferred revenue of $4.4 million primarily due the timing of service contract signing which resulted in more service contract deferrals as compared to prior period with a slight offset related to deferred system revenue which decreased due to additional installations of previously deferred systems;       Decrease in deferred cost of revenue of $1.9 million due to additional installations of previously deferred systems;       Increase in accounts payable of $1.3 million due to the timing of payments; and       Decrease in accrued liabilities of $3.1 million primarily related to the bonus accrual reduction of $9.1 million due to bonus payments made in the first fiscal quarter of 2015 offset by additional accrual for bonuses for the six months ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $3.7 million in deferred rent due to a renegotiated lease agreement, an increase of $1.0 million in legal fees due to the timing of billings and payments for continued matters, and increases of $0.6 million in interest payable and $0.3 million in foreign taxes payable due to timing of payments.    Cash Flows From Investing Activities    Net cash used in investing activities was $7.7 million for the six months ended December31, 2015, which primarily consisted of purchases of short-term investments of $33.1 million and purchases of property and equipment of $4.1 million partially offset by sales and maturities of investments of $29.5 million.    Net cash provided by investing activities was $21.2 million for the six months ended December31, 2014, which primarily consisted of sales and maturities of short-term investments of $81.4 million partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of $4.2 million and purchases of investments of $56.0 million .    26           Cash Flows From Financing Activities    Net cash used in financing activities during the six months ended December31, 2015 was $0.8 million from proceeds from employee stock plans offset by taxes paid related to net share settlement or equity awards. Net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended December31, 2014 was $2.6 million from proceeds from employee stock plans.    Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements    Our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors. These factors include but are not limited to the following:       Revenue generated by sales of our products and service plans;       Costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities;       Facilities, equipment and IT systems required to support current and future operations;       Rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities;       Costs of obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances of our products;       Effects of competing technological and market developments; and       Number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions.    We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least 12months. If our cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain this additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts.    Contractual Obligations and Commitments    We presented our contractual obligations in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the fiscal year ended June30, 2015. There have been no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business in those obligations during the current quarter.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. Actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates if actual conditions differ from our assumptions.    During the six months ended December31, 2015 we considered our estimated corporate bonus accrual to be a critical accounting estimate. The Company s bonus accrual for each quarter is based on its performance against Company defined metrics: net revenue, adjusted EBITDA and gross orders to backlog. There have been no changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates, as discussed in PartII,Item 7 of our Form10-K for the year ended June30, 2015, which we believe are those related to revenue recognition, assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of inventories, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, allowance for doubtful accounts and loss contingencies.    27
