AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015 1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS ADMA Biologics, Inc. ("ADMA" or the "Company") is a late stage biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and intends to commercialize specialty plasma-based biologics for the treatment and prevention of certain infectious diseases. The Company's targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disease or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. ADMA also operates its wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA BioCenters Georgia, Inc., ("ADMA BioCenters"), a source plasma collection business with U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approved facilities in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia.Each facility holds certifications fromthe German Health Authority ("GHA") and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety ("MFDS").ADMA BioCenters provides ADMA with a portion of its raw material plasma for the manufacture of RI-002, ADMA's lead product candidate, which is intended for the treatment of Primary Immune Deficiency Disease, ("PIDD"). A Biologics License Application ("BLA") for RI-002 was submitted to the FDA and accepted for review during the third quarter of 2015.The Company's Marietta, Georgia center received FDA approval to sell human source plasma within the U.S. during the third quarter of 2015. The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception in 2004 and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.Since inception, the Company has needed to raise capital from the sales of its equity securities and debt financings to sustain operations. In October 2013, the Company completed an Initial Public Offering ("IPO") to raise gross proceeds of approximately $29.1 million.In March 2015, ADMA completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $11.3 million.In June 2015, ADMA entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the "LSA") with Oxford Finance LLC ("Oxford"), as collateral agent and lender, pursuant to which ADMA accessed an initial term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $16.0 million, of which approximately $15.7 million was used to repay a priorloan balance of approximately $15.0 million to Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. ("Hercules"), along with approximately $0.4 million of interest and approximately $0.3 million of prepayment premiumand other fees, under its prior loan and security agreement, dated December 21, 2012, with Hercules (the "Prior Loan Agreement"), as amended on February 24, 2014, (see Note 3).ADMA may elect to access an additional term loan under the LSA in the aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million if it receives approval of its BLA for RI-002 from the FDA on or before January 31, 2017, which funding would also extend its interest only period for an additional six months pursuant to the May 2016 amendment to the LSA.In May2016 the Company amended its LSA with Oxford.This amendment provided ADMA with an additional $4.0 million term loan, the availability of which was predicated on completing an equity financing of its common stock of at least $10.0 million in gross proceeds no later than May 31, 2016.In May 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million, (see Note 8 for additional details on the equity financing and loan amendment) and subsequently borrowed an additional $4.0 million from Oxford under the amended LSA, which brings the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million. As of March 31, 2016, the Company had working capital of $13.1 million, consisting primarily of $8.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.7 million of short-term investments, $1.0 million of accounts receivable, $4.0 million of inventories, and $0.7 million of prepaid expenses, offset primarily by $2.4 million of accounts payable, $1.7 million of accrued expenses and $0.1 million of deferred revenue.Based upon the Company's projected revenue and expenditures for 2016 and 2017, including the ongoing implementation of the Company's commercialization and expansion activities, management currently believes that its cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable as of the date of this report are sufficient to fund ADMA's operations, as currently conducted, into the second half of 2017. Because the Company does not anticipate receiving FDA approval for RI-002earlier thanthe second half of 2016, if at all, the Company would not expect to generate revenue from the commercialization of RI-002 earlier than such time, if at all. Furthermore, if the Company's assumptions are incorrect underlying its estimated expenses, timing of FDA approval for RI-002, or estimated revenues for RI-002, it may have to raise additional capital sooner than anticipated.The Company has the option to borrow an additional $5.0 million through its current LSA with Oxford, based upon the Company receiving BLA approval by the FDA for RI-002 by January 31, 2017. Other than this additional $5.0 million, the Company does not have any existing commitments for future external funding.The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if convertible, could result in dilution to the Company's stockholders.The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict the Company's operations or other financing alternatives.Additional equity or debt financing, grants, or corporate collaboration and potential licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate the Company's research and development programs, reduce the Company's planned clinical trials and delay or abandon potential commercialization efforts of the Company's lead or other product candidates.The Company has reported losses since inception in June 2004 through March 31, 2016 of $92.0 million.Managementbelieves that the Company will continue to incur net losses and negative net cash flows from operating activities to fund its research and development, commercial programs and meet its obligations on a timely basis through the foreseeable future.ADMA's long-term liquidity will be dependent upon on its ability to obtain FDA approval for RI-002, generate sales of RI-002 and potentially raise additional capital, to fund its research and development and commercial programs and meet to its obligations on a timely basis, if at all. 5 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015 There can be no assurance that the Company's research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable.The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, dependence on collaborative arrangements and third-party manufacturers, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with FDA and other governmental regulations and approval requirements. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADMA and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, ADMA Plasma Biologics, Inc. and ADMA BioCenters. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) which in the opinion of management are necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2016 and its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim periods or for the full year.These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, (the "SEC") on March 23, 2016. 6 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015 The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, ("GAAP"), in accordance with the rules and regulations of theSEC for interim reporting.Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in complete annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted. Inventories Plasma inventories (both plasma intended for resale and plasma intended for internal use intheCompany'sresearch and development and future anticipated commercialization activities) are carried at the lower of cost or market value determined on the first-in, first-out method.Research and development plasma used in clinical trials was processed to a finished product and subsequently expensed to research and development.Inventory at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consists of high titer plasma and normal source plasma. Debt In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset.Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 in its second quarter 2015 condensed consolidated financial statements and recast the prior period balances to conform to the current period presentation. Revenue recognition Depending on the agreement with the customer, revenues from the sale of human plasma collected at the Company's FDA licensed plasma collection centers are recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which occurs at the time of shipment.Revenue is recognized at the time of delivery if the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment.The Company's revenues are substantially attributable to one customer.Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement have been completed. Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016 are comprised of product revenues from the sale of normal source human plasma collected from the Company's plasma collection centers segment and license and other revenues are primarily attributable to the out-licensing of RI-002 to Biotest AG to market and sell in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East.Biotest AG and Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Biotest, a subsidiary of Biotest AG, has provided the Company with certain financial payment and services in accordance with the related license agreement and is obligated to pay the Company certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are achieved.During the third quarter 2015, the Company recorded deferred revenue of $1.5 million for a milestone payment provided to the Company upon its filing of the BLA for RI-002 with the FDA, in accordance with the terms of the license agreement. Deferred revenue of $1.7 million was recorded in 2013 as a result of certain research and development services provided in accordance with the same license agreement. Deferred revenue is recognized over the term of the license.Deferred revenue is amortized into income for a period of approximately 20 years, the term of the license agreement. 7 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015 Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates.Significant estimates include valuation of inventory, assumptions used in the fair value determination of stock-based compensation, warrants and the allowance for the valuation of future tax benefits. Loss per common share Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, if any, by the weighted average number of common stock and dilutive common stock outstanding during the period.Potential common stock includes the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method).Potential common stock in the diluted net loss per share computation is excluded to the extent that it would be anti-dilutive.No potentially dilutive securities are included in the computation of any diluted per share amounts as the Company reported a net loss for all periods presented.The aggregate number of potentially dilutive securities upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options was 1.8 million and 1.5 million as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Stock-based compensation The Company follows recognized accounting guidance which requires all stock-based payments, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense, based on their fair values on the grant date. The estimated fair value of stock options granted under the Company's 2007 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "2007 Plan") and the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2014 Plan") is recognized as compensation expense over the option-vesting period. During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company granted stock options to purchase 85,984 and 230,000 shares of common stock, respectively, to its directors and employees. 3. DEBT Loan and Security Agreement On June 19, 2015, the Company entered into the LSA with Oxford for up to $21.0 million and refinanced its existing loan with Hercules.The first tranche of $16.0 million from the Oxford loan was primarily used to repay itsprevious facility with Hercules and the remaining $5.0 million is available at ADMA's option upon RI-002's BLA being approved from the FDA on or before January 31, 2017, which funding would also extend its interest only period for an additional six months pursuant to the May 2016 amendment to the LSA.The LSA bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.80% and (ii) the sum of (a) the three (3) month U.S. LIBOR rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal) on the date occurring on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 7.54% on the outstanding principal balance.The Company is obligated to begin to repay the principal over 36 months beginning February 1, 2017, unless accelerated as a result of certain events of default. A final payment equal to 8.95% of the funded loan amount is due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment.In the event of the six-month interest only extension, the final payment will be 9.95% of the funded loan, which shall also be due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. In addition, a facility fee of $105,000 was paid at closing.In the event the Company prepaysa loan for any reason, the Company is obligated to pay a prepayment charge corresponding to a percentage of the principal amount of the applicableloan prepaid, with such percentage being: 3.0% if prepayment occurs through the first anniversary of itsfunding, 2.0% if prepayment occurs after the first anniversarythrough the second anniversary of the applicable funding date, and1.0% if prepayment occurs after the second anniversary ofits funding date and prior to itsmaturity date. The loan matures no later than January 1, 2020. The loan is secured by the Company's assets, except for its intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). The LSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including limitations on incurring indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions and making investments, distributions or transfers.The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the LSA were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of a specific date or specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the LSA. Events of default under the agreement include, but are not limited to: (i) insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar events; (ii) failure to pay any debts due under the LSA or other loan documents on a timely basis; (iii) failure to observe any covenant or secured obligation under the LSA or other loan documents, which failure, in most cases, is not cured within 10 days of written notice by lender; (iv) occurrence of any default under any other agreement between the Company and the lender, which is not cured within 10 days; (v) occurrence of an event that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect;(vi) material misrepresentations; (vii) occurrence of any default under any other agreement involving indebtedness or the occurrence of a default under any agreement that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect; and (viii) certain money judgments are entered against the Company or a certain portion of its assets are attached or seized.Remedies for events of default include acceleration of amounts owed under the LSA and taking immediate possession of, and selling, any collateral securing the loan. 8 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015 In connection with the LSA, on June 19, 2015, the Company issued to Oxford a seven year warrant, expiring on June 19, 2022, to purchase 74,309 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $8.51 per share. The Company recorded $367,700 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan.The key assumptions used to value the warrants included: volatility of 57% on the Company's common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of the Company's common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 1.99% and a term of 7 years.As a result of prepaying the Hercules loan prior to maturity, the Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million comprised of unamortized debt issuance costs, unamortized debt discount related to the warrants issued to Hercules, along with a prepayment penalty. In May2016, the Company amended its LSA with Oxford.This amendment provided ADMA with an additional $4.0 million term loan, the availability of which was predicated on completing an equity financing of its common stock of at least $10.0 million in gross proceeds no later than May 31, 2016.In May 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million, (see Note 8 for additional details on the equity financing and loan amendment) and subsequently borrowed an additional $4.0 millionfrom Oxford under the amended LSA, which brings the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million. 9 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015 A summary of the Oxford loan balance as of March 31, 2016 is as follows: 4. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY On March 18, 2015, the Company announced the closing of an underwritten sale of 1,225,000 shares of its common stock, as well as 183,750 additional shares of its common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters thereof, for gross proceeds of approximately $11.3 million. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $10.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million. The shares were sold under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200638) that was declared effective by the SEC on December 23, 2014. In May 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million, (see Note 8 for additional details on the equity financing). Equity incentive plan The fair value of employee options granted was determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. The Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Because there has been minimal data for the Company's stock and very little historical experience with the Company's stock options, similar public companies and a pro rata percentage of the Company'scommon stock were used for calculating ADMA's volatility for comparison and expectations as to the assumptions required for fair value computation using the Black-Scholes methodology. Guidance for stock-based compensation requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.The Company has not experienced any material forfeitures of stock options and, as such, has not established a forfeiture rate since the stock options currently outstanding are primarily held by its senior management and directors.The Company will continue to evaluate the effects of such future potential forfeitures, as they may arise, to evaluate its estimated forfeiture rate. The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options outstanding and expected to vest at March 31, 2016 is 7.1 years.The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options exercisable at March 31, 2016 is 6.1 years. 10 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015 A summary of the Company's option activity under the 2007 Plan and 2014 Plan and related information is as follows: Stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: As of March 31, 2016, the total compensation expense related to unvested options not yet recognized totaled $2,469,668. The weighted average vesting period over which the total compensation expense will be recorded related to unvested options not yet recognized at March 31, 2016 was approximately 2.7 years. 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company leases an office building and equipment from an entity owned by related parties on a month-to-month basis.Rent expense amounted to $24,112 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The Company also reimburses its landlord for office related expenses, equipment and certain other operational expenses, which have been insignificant to the consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.The Company maintains deposits and other accounts at a bank whichwas less than 5%-owned by related parties through January 2016,and where a stockholder and Company director was a member of the bank'sboard of directors through January 2016, and is now a member of its Corporate Advisory Council. 11 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In May 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 2,176,154 shares of itscommon stock, for gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million.Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $13.0 million, after payment of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million.The shares were sold under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200638) that was declared effective by the SEC on December 23, 2014. Additionally, in May 2016, the Company amended its LSA with Oxford.This amdendment provided ADMA with an additional term loan of $4.0 million, the availability of which was predicated on the Company completing an equity raise of at least $10.0 million in gross proceeds by May 31, 2016. The Company subsequently borrowed the additional $4.0 million from Oxford under the amended LSA, and in connection therewith, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to24,800shares of the Company's Common Stock at an exercise price equal to $6.37, which will expire seven yearsafter their issuance on May 13, 2023and incurreda facility fee of$20,000 as part of accessing the additional funding.Item 1.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS ADMA Biologics, Inc. ("ADMA" or the "Company") is a late stage biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and intends to commercialize specialty plasma-based biologics for the treatment and prevention of certain infectious diseases. The Company's targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disease or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. ADMA also operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA BioCenters Georgia, Inc., ("ADMA BioCenters"), a source plasma collection business with U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approved facilities in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia.Each facility holds certifications from the German Health Authority ("GHA") and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety ("MFDS").ADMA BioCenters supplies ADMA with a portion of its raw material plasma for the manufacture of RI-002, ADMA's lead product candidate, which the Company is currently developingfor the treatment of Primary Immune Deficiency Disease ("PIDD"). A Biologics License Application ("BLA") for RI-002 was submitted to the FDA and accepted for review during the third quarter of 2015.In July 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter ("CRL") to the Company's BLA for RI-002.The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety and efficacy data for RI-002, nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical studies be conducted prior to FDA approval of RI-002 for PIDD.In its letter, among other things, the FDA focused on outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies at ADMA's third-party vendors, including the Company's contract drug substance and product manufacturer, its contract fill and finish provider and compliance issues with a third-party contract testing laboratory, and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues.The FDA indicated that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things, these deficiencies are resolved. In October 2013, the Company completed an Initial Public Offering ("IPO") that resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $29.1 million.In March 2015, ADMA completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $11.3 million.In June 2015, ADMA entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the "LSA") with Oxford Finance LLC ("Oxford"), as collateral agent and lender, pursuant to which ADMA accessed an initial term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $16.0 million, of which approximately $15.7 million was used to repay a priorloan balance of approximately $15.0 million to Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. ("Hercules"), along with approximately $0.4 million of interest and approximately $0.3 million of prepayment premiumand other fees, under its prior loan and security agreement, dated December 21, 2012, with Hercules (the "Prior Loan Agreement"), as amended on February 24, 2014, (see Note 3).In May2016 the Company amended its LSA with Oxford (the "Amended LSA").This amendment provided ADMA with an additional $4.0 million term loan, the availability of which was contingent on completing an equity financing of its common stock of at least $10.0 million in gross proceeds no later than May 31, 2016.In May 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million, and subsequently borrowed an additional $4.0 million from Oxford under the Amended LSA, which brought the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had working capital of $24.4 million, consisting primarily of $12.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $11.3 million of short-term investments, $4.2 million of inventories, $0.8 million of accounts receivable and $0.6 million of prepaid expenses, offset primarily by $3.3 million of accounts payable, $1.6 million of accrued expenses and $0.1 million of deferred revenue.Based upon the Company's projected revenue and expenditures for 2016 and 2017, including regulatory and consulting fees for RI-002 associated with third-party manufacturers and ongoing discussions with the FDA, continuing implementation of the Company's commercialization and expansion activities, management currently believes that its cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable as of the date of this report are sufficient to fund ADMA's operations, as currently conducted, into the second half of 2017.These estimates may change based upon whether or when the FDA approves RI-002 and the timing of any required commercial manufacturing scale up activities. The Company has the option to borrow an additional $5.0 million through its current LSA with Oxford, if RI-002 is approved by the FDA prior to January 31, 2017, which funding would also extend its interest only period for an additional six months pursuant to the May 2016 amendment to the LSA.Other than this additional $5.0 million, the Company does not have any existing commitments for future external funding.In addition to traditional debt financing, the Company may also sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, each of which could result in dilution to the Company's stockholders.The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict the Company's operations or other financing alternatives.Additional equity or debt financing, grants, or corporate collaboration and potential licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate the Company's research and development programs, and delay or abandon potential commercialization efforts of the Company's lead or other product candidates.The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception in 2004 and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.Since inception, the Company has raised capital from the sales ofits equity securities and debt financings to sustain operations. The Company has reported losses since inception in June 2004 through June 30, 2016 of $98.0 million.ADMA's long-term liquidity will be dependent upon on its ability to obtain FDA approval for RI-002, generate sales of RI-002 and potentially raise additional capital, to fund its research and development and commercial programs and to meet its obligations on a timely basis, if at all. 5 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 There can be no assurance that the Company's research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable.The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, dependence on collaborative arrangements and third-party manufacturers, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with FDA and other governmental regulations and approval requirements. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADMA and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, ADMA Plasma Biologics, Inc. and ADMA BioCenters. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) which in the opinion of management are necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2016 and its results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, change in stockholders' equity for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim periods or for the full year.These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 23, 2016.The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, was derived from the 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim reporting.Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in complete annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted. 6 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 Inventories Plasma inventories (both plasma intended for resale and plasma intended for internal use intheCompany'sresearch and development and future anticipated commercialization activities of which certain quantities are labeled as normal source and Respiratory Syncytial Virus, ("RSV")high titer) are carried at the lower of cost or market value determined by the first-in, first-out method.Research and development plasma used in clinical trials was processed to a finished product and subsequently expensed to research and development.Inventory at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consists of high titer RSV plasma and normal source plasma. Debt In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset.Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 in its second quarter 2015 condensed consolidated financial statements and recast the prior period balances to conform to the current period presentation. Revenue recognition Depending on the agreement with the customer, revenues from the sale of human plasma collected at the Company's FDA-licensed plasma collection centers are recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which occurs at the time of shipment.Revenue is recognized at the time of delivery if the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment.The Company's revenues are substantially attributable to one customer.Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement have been completed. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are comprised of product revenues from the sale of normal source human plasma collected from the Company's plasma collection centers segment and license and other revenues are primarily attributable to the out-licensing of RI-002 to Biotest Aktiengesellschaft ("Biotest AG") to market and sell in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East.Biotest AG and Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("Biotest"), a subsidiary of Biotest AG, have provided the Company with certain services and financial payments in accordance with the related Biotest AG license agreement and is obligated to pay the Company certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are achieved.During the third quarter 2015, the Company recorded deferred revenue of $1.5 million for a milestone payment provided to the Company upon its filing of the BLA for RI-002 with the FDA, in accordance with the terms of the Biotest AG license agreement. Deferred revenue is recognized over the term of the Biotest AG license.Deferred revenue is amortized into income for a period of approximately 20 years, the term of the Biotest AG license agreement. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates.Significant estimates include valuation of inventory, assumptions used in the fair value determination of stock-based compensation, warrants and the allowance for the valuation of future tax benefits. 7 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 Loss per common share Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, if any, by the weighted average number of common stock and dilutive common stock outstanding during the period.Potential common stock includes the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method).Potential common stock in the diluted net loss per share computation is excluded to the extent that it would be anti-dilutive.No potentially dilutive securities are included in the computation of any diluted per share amounts as the Company reported a net loss for all periods presented.The aggregate number of potentially dilutive securities upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options was 1.8 million and 1.5 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Stock-based compensation The Company follows recognized accounting guidance which requires all stock-based payments, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense, based on their fair values on the grant date. The estimated fair value of stock options granted under the Company's 2007 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "2007 Plan") and the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2014 Plan") is recognized as compensation expense over the option-vesting period. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company granted stock options to purchase 15,000 and 100,984 shares of common stock, respectively, to its directors and employees.During the three and six months ended June 30,2015, the Company granted stock options to purchase 1,000 and 231,000 shares of common stock, respectively, to its directors and employees. 3. DEBT Loan and Security Agreement On June 19, 2015, the Company entered into the LSA with Oxford for up to $21.0 million of debt financing in two tranches, and refinanced its then existing loan with Hercules.The first tranche of $16.0 million from the Oxford loan was primarily used to repay the Company'sprevious facility with Hercules and the remaining $5.0 million is available at ADMA's option if RI-002's BLA is approved by the FDA on or before January 31, 2017, which funding would also extend the interest only period for an additional six months pursuant to the May 2016 amendment to the LSA. The LSA bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.80% and (ii) the sum of (a) the three (3) month U.S. LIBOR rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal) on the date occurring on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 7.54% on the outstanding principal balance.The Company is obligated to begin to repay the principal over 36 months beginning February 1, 2017, unless accelerated as a result of certain events of default. A final payment equal to 8.95% of the funded loan amount is due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment.In the event of the six-month interest only extension, the final payment will be 9.95% of the funded loan, which shall also be due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. In addition, a facility fee of $105,000 was paid at closing.In the event the Company prepaysa loan for any reason, the Company is obligated to pay a prepayment charge corresponding to a percentage of the principal amount of the applicableloan prepaid, with such percentage being: 3.0% if prepayment occurs through the first anniversary of itsfunding, 2.0% if prepayment occurs after the first anniversarythrough the second anniversary of the applicable funding date, and1.0% if prepayment occurs after the second anniversary ofits funding date and prior to itsmaturity date. The loan matures no later than January 1, 2020. The loan is secured by the Company's assets, except for its intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). The LSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including limitations on incurring indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions and making investments, distributions or transfers.The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the LSA were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of a specific date or specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the LSA. Events of default under the agreement include, but are not limited to: (i) insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar events; (ii) failure to pay any debts due under the LSA or other loan documents on a timely basis; (iii) failure to observe any covenant or secured obligation under the LSA or other loan documents, which failure, in most cases, is not cured within 10 days of written notice by lender; (iv) occurrence of any default under any other agreement between the Company and the lender, which is not cured within 10 days; (v) occurrence of an event that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect;(vi) material misrepresentations; (vii) occurrence of any default under any other agreement involving indebtedness or the occurrence of a default under any agreement that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect; and (viii) certain money judgments are entered against the Company or a certain portion of its assets are attached or seized.Remedies for events of default include acceleration of amounts owed under the LSA and taking immediate possession of, and selling, any collateral securing the loan. 8 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 In connection with the LSA, on June 19, 2015, the Company issued to Oxford a seven-year warrant, expiring on June 19, 2022, to purchase 74,309 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $8.51 per share. The Company recorded $367,700 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan.The key assumptions used to value the warrants included: volatility of 57% on the Company's common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of the Company's common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 1.99% and a term of seven years.As a result of prepaying the Hercules loan prior to maturity, the Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million comprised of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized debt discount related to the warrants issued to Hercules, along with a prepayment penalty. In May 2016, the Company amended its LSA with Oxford, referred to as the Amended LSA, which provided ADMA with an additional $4.0 million term loan (the "Term B Loan"), the availability of which was conditioned on completing an equity financing of its common stock of at least $10.0 million in gross proceeds no later than May 31, 2016.On May 3, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million and subsequently borrowed the additional $4.0 million from Oxford under the Amended LSA, which brings the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million.Under the Amended LSA, the Company may borrow an additional aggregate amount up to $5.0 million (the "Term C Loan"), at its option during the period commencing on the date the Company's BLA for RI-002 is approved by the FDA and ending on the earlier of (i) January 31, 2017, (ii) thirty (30) days after the occurrence of such FDA approval and (iii) the occurrence of an event of default under the Amended LSA, in which case the additional loan amount would not be available while the event of default continues.Upon the Company accessing the additional $5.0 million, the interest only period will be extended from February 1, 2017 to August 1, 2017.The Amended LSA further modified the fees payable by the Company on mandatory or voluntary prepayment of a term loan prior to its maturity date as follows:(i) for a prepayment made on or after the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the first anniversary of its funding date, an amount equal to 3.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid; (ii) for a prepayment made after the first anniversary of the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the second anniversary of such funding date, an amount equal to 2.00% of the principal amount of such term loan prepaid; and (iii) for a prepayment of a term loan made after the second anniversary of its funding date and prior to its maturity date, an amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid. 9 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 Pursuant to the Amended LSA, (i) the Company paid a total facility fee of $125,000, consisting of $105,000 previously paid and an additional $20,000 paid on the date the Term B Loan was funded; (ii) certain adjustments were made to the time periods for any applicable prepayment fees; and (iii) certain defined terms were adjusted, including a new Amortization Date that is defined as(a) February 17, 2017, if the Term C Loan is not made and (b) August 1, 2017 if the Term C Loan is made.The Amended LSA further provides for customary representations, warranties and covenants for the Company.Except as otherwise amended, the Amended LSA does not alter the terms of the LSA. In addition, on May 13, 2016, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the LSA as modified by the Amended LSA, the Company agreed to issue the lenders warrants to purchase shares of its common stock, upon its draw of each tranche of the term loans. The aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is equal to 3.95% of the amount drawn of such tranche, divided by the average reported closing price per share of common stock for the ten (10) consecutive trading days prior to the applicable draw. In connection with the Amended LSA, on May 13, 2016, the Company issued to Oxford a seven- year warrant, expiring on May 23, 2023, to purchase 24,800 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.37 per share, in accordance with the Company's drawdown of the Term B Loan. The Company recorded $86,300 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan.The key assumptions used to value the warrants included: volatility of 53.5% on the Company's common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of the Company's common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 1.51% and a term of seven years. A summary of the Oxford loan balance as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is as follows: 4. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY On May 3, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 2,176,154 shares of itscommon stock, for gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million.Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $13.0 million, after payment of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million.The shares were sold under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200638) that was declared effective by the SEC on December 23, 2014. 10 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 On March 18, 2015, the Company announced the closing of an underwritten sale of 1,225,000 shares of its common stock, as well as 183,750 additional shares of its common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters thereof, for gross proceeds of approximately $11.3 million. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $10.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million. The shares were sold under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200638) that was declared effective by the SEC on December 23, 2014. Oxford Debt Financing Warrant Issuance In May 2016, the Company entered into an Amended LSA with Oxford and accessed an additional $4.0 million Term B Loan under the amended credit facility.In connection therewith, the Company issued to Oxford warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 24,800 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal to $6.37 per share. The warrants became exercisable on or after May 13, 2016 for cash or by net exercise and will expire seven years after their issuance on May 13, 2023. Equity incentive plan The fair value of employee options granted was determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.The Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.Because there has been minimal data for the Company's stock and very little historical experience with the Company's stock options, similar public companies and a pro rata percentage of the Company'scommon stock were used for calculating ADMA's volatility for comparison and expectations as to the assumptions required for fair value computation using the Black-Scholes methodology. Guidance for stock-based compensation requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.The Company has not experienced any material forfeitures of stock options and, as such, has not established a forfeiture rate since the stock options currently outstanding are primarily held by its senior management and directors.The Company will continue to evaluate the effects of such future potential forfeitures, as they may arise, to evaluate its estimated forfeiture rate. The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options outstanding and expected to vest at June 30, 2016 is 6.9 years.The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options exercisable at June 30, 2016 is 6.0 years. 11 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 A summary of the Company's option activity under the 2007 Plan and 2014 Plan and related information is as follows: Stock-based compensation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: As of June 30, 2016, the total compensation expense related to unvested options not yet recognized totaled $2,133,286. The weighted average vesting period over which the total compensation expense will be recorded related to unvested options not yet recognized at June 30, 2016 was approximately 2.5 years. 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company leases an office building and equipment from an entity owned by related parties on a month-to-month basis of which terms were amended by the Company's Board of Directors in June 2016 as a result of the Company accessing additional office space related to the expansion and hiring activities in preparation for a potential commercial launch of RI-002.Rent expense amounted to $71,888 and $24,112 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $96,000 and $48,224 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The Company also reimburses its landlord for office related expenses, equipment and certain other operational expenses, which have been insignificant to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.The Company maintains deposits and other accounts at a bank whichwas less than 5%-owned by related parties through January 2016,and where a stockholder and Company director was a member of the bank'sboard of directors through January 2016, and is now a member of its Corporate Advisory Council. 12 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of, and for, the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on March 23, 2016. Forward-Looking Statements This quarterly report on Form10-Q contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, orthe Securities Act, and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. The forward-looking statements are only predictions and provide our current expectations or forecasts of future events and financial performance and may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms "believes," "estimates," "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "intends," "may," "will" or "should" or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology, though the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking.Forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts and include, without limitation, statements concerning our business strategy, outlook, objectives, future milestones, plans, intentions, goals, and future financial condition, including the period of time for which our existing resources will enable us to fund our operations.Forward-looking statements also include our financial, clinical, manufacturing and distribution plans and our expectations and timing related to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval and commercialization of RI-002. We intend that all forward-looking statements be subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Forward-looking statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements.They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance.Examples of the risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully resubmit to the FDA,our Biologics License Application, or BLA, for RI-002 once the deficiencies identified in the July 2016 Complete Response Letter, or CRL, have been resolved by us and/or our third party vendors to the satisfaction of the FDA, and other requests for information included therein have been provided by us, our plans to develop, market, launch and build our own commercial infrastructure and commercialize RI-002 and the success of such efforts, the expected timing of and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, including the timeframe within which we may receive approval from the FDA, if at all, of our BLA for RI-002 and the labeling or nature of any such approvals, the achievement of or expected timing, progress and results of clinical development, trials and potential regulatory approvals, 16 our dependence upon one manufacturer for RI-002 and the effect any adverse events on such manufacturer could have on us or our business, our dependence upon our third-party contract manufacturers and vendors, our ability to obtain adequate quantities of FDA-approved normal source plasma and Respiratory Syncytical Virus, or RSV, high-titer plasma with proper specifications, our plans to increase our supplies of plasma, the potential indications for our product candidates, potential investigational new product applications, the acceptability of RI-002 for any purpose by physicians, patients or payers, concurrence by FDA with our conclusions and the satisfaction by us of its guidance, the comparability of results of RI-002 to other comparably run injectable immune globulin trials, the potential of RI-002 to provide meaningful clinical improvement for patients living with Primary Immune Deficiency Disease, or PIDD, our intellectual property position, including our expectations of the scope of patent protection with respect to RI-002, or other future pipeline product candidates, our manufacturing capabilities, third-party contractor capabilities and strategy, our plans relating to manufacturing, supply and other collaborative agreements, our estimates regarding expenses, capital requirements and needs for additional financing, possible or likely reimbursement levels, if any, if and when RI-002 is approved for marketing, estimates regarding market size, projected growth and sales as well as our expectations of market acceptance of RI-002, expectations for future capital requirements. Pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device technology companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising earlier trial results.Data obtained from such clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.After gaining approval of a drug product, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies face considerable challenges in marketing and distributing their products, and may never become profitable. You should read carefully the factors described in the "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 23, 2016, our Current Report on Form 8-K, as filed with the SEC on April 27, 2016 and in other filings with the SEC to better understand significant risks and uncertainties inherent in our business and underlying any forward-looking statements. As a result of these factors, actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements in this report and you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. 17 Any forward-looking statements that we make in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q speak only as of the date of such statements and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements or to publicly announce revisions to any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition to the risks identified under the heading "Risk Factors" in the SEC filings referenced previously, many important factors affect our ability to achieve our plans and objectives and to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, our results may be affected by our ability to manage our financial resources, difficulties or delays in developing manufacturing processes for our product candidates, preclinical and toxicology testing and regulatory developments.Delays in clinical programs, whether caused by competitive developments, adverse events, patient enrollment rates, regulatory issues or other factors, could adversely affect our financial position and prospects.Prior clinical trial program designs and results are not necessarily indicative of future clinical trial designs or results. If our product candidates do not meet safety or efficacy endpoints in clinical evaluations, they will not receive regulatory approval and we will not be able to market them. The FDA may not approve our BLA for RI-002, our data, our results, or permit us to proceed.We may not be able to enter into any strategic partnership agreements. Operating expenses and cash flow projections involve a high degree of uncertainty, including variances in future spending rates due to changes in corporate priorities, the timing and outcomes of clinical trials, competitive developments and the impact on expenditures and available capital from licensing and strategic collaboration opportunities.If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue one or more of our drug development or discovery research programs and delay or abandon potential commercialization efforts.We may not ever have any products that generate significant revenue. Therefore, current and prospective security holders are cautioned that there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this document will prove to be accurate.

Our targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disorder or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. Our product candidates are intended to be used by physician specialists focused on caring for immune-compromised patients with or at risk for certain infectious diseases. Our Lead Product Candidate RI-002 We are currently developing our lead product candidate, RI-002, for the treatment of PIDD, and have completed a pivotal Phase III clinical study.RI-002 is derived from human plasma blended from normal donors and donors tested to have high levels of neutralizing titers to RSV.RI-002 is manufactured using a process called fractionation, which purifies immune globulins, or IgG, from this blended plasma pool resulting in a final IVIG product enriched with naturally occurring polyclonal anti-pathogen antibodies (e.g., streptococcus pneumonia, H. influenza type B, Cytomegalovirus or CMV, measles, tetanus, etc.).We use our proprietary RSV microneutralization assay to test for standardized levels of neutralizing antibodies to RSV in the final drug product. 18 In the third quarter of 2015, the FDA accepted for review a BLA for RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD.In July 2016, the FDA issued a CRL to the BLA.The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety or efficacy data for RI-002 submitted in the BLA, nor did the FDA request any additional clinical studies be completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002.The FDA identified in the CRL, among other things,certain outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies at our third-party contract manufacturers/vendors and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues. The FDA indicated in the CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things,these deficiencies are resolved.We are working with our third-party contract manufacturers/vendors to monitor their efforts in addressing and resolving outstanding issues.If RI-002 is approved by the FDA, we intend to commercialize RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD and explore an alternative process to evaluate and seek approval for RI-002 for additional indications, patient populations and uses. Evaluation of PIDD Patients PIDD, a genetic disorder that causes a deficient or absent immune system, is caused by hereditary or genetic defects and can affect anyone regardless of age or gender.PIDD patients are more vulnerable to infections and more likely to suffer complications from these infections.IVIG is a plasma derived product that is used to prevent serious infections in patients with PIDD.It is comprised of polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins produced by B-cells that are used by the body's immune system to neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses.It is estimated that there are about 250,000 diagnosed PIDD patients in the United States, approximately half of whom are treated with IVIG regularly.In the United States, sales of immune globulin products for all its uses were reported to be approximately $4.8 billion in 2014. The RI-002 pivotal Phase III clinical trial was conducted as a single arm study in which patients were treated approximately once per month for a period of 12 months plus 90 days for follow up. Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in nine treatment centers in the United States. The pivotal Phase III primary endpoint followed published FDA industry guidance, which provides for a reduction in the incidence of serious infections to less than one per year in each subject receiving IVIG. The secondary outcome was safety and included other pharmacokinetic, or PK, data collection points including antibody titers for certain agents, including RSV antibody levels at various time points after infusion. RI-002 demonstrated positive results in the Phase III study in patients with PIDD, meeting its primary endpoint, of noSerious Bacterial Infections, or SBI,reported.RI-002 was administered a total of 793 infusions with zero serious adverse events to 59 patients in nine treatment centers throughout the United States.These results, included in the BLA, more than meet the requirement specified by FDA guidance of 1 SBI per patient-year. On February 22, 2015, at the 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Annual Meeting, scientific investigators reported on the secondary outcomes that included: a total of 93 days, or 1.66 days per patient per year lost from work or school due to infection; one hospitalization due to an infection of only five days duration in the entire study and IgG trough levels above those required by the FDA for IVIG products.Additionally, there was a marked increase in all of the measured specific anti-pathogen antibodies in PK subjects (n=31). The mean of maximum fold increases in specific antibody levels after infusion of RI-002 ranged from 1.9 fold (S. pneumonia type 19A) to 5.3 fold (RSV), which were statistically significant fold increases from the pathogen's specific measured baselines. The safety profile of RI-002 is comparable to that of other immunoglobulins. 19 Rationale for the Potential Evaluation in RSV Infected Patients RSV is a common virus that ordinarily leads to mild, cold-like symptoms in healthy adults and children.In high-risk groups, such as the PIDD population and the other immune-compromised populations, RSV can lead to a more serious infection and may even cause death. The polyclonal antibodies which are present in RI-002 are expected to prevent infections in immune-compromised patients. We previously conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to evaluate RI-001, RI-002's predecessor product candidate, in immune-compromised, RSV-infected patients. This trial was conducted with 21 patients in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Phase II dose-ranging trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline RSV titers to day 18 in the high dose and low dose treatment groups when compared with placebo (p=0.0043 and p=0.0268, respectively). The mean fold increase for high dose was 9.24 (95% CI 4.07, 21.02) and the observed mean fold increase for low dose was 4.85 (95% CI 2.22, 10.59). The mean fold change for placebo treated patients was 1.42 (95% CI 0.64, 3.17). In addition, more patients in the high dose (85.7%) and low dose (42.9%) groups experienced greater than a 4-fold increase from baseline to day 18 in RSV titer levels compared to placebo (0%). There were no serious drug-related adverse events reported during the trial. From April 2009 through February 2011, RI-001 was also administered to 15 compassionate use patients where physicians requested access to the product for treating their patients with documented lower respiratory tract RSV infections due to the fact that these patients had failed conventional therapeutic interventions.Serum samples were obtained from 13 patients.Samples showed that patients demonstrated a 4-fold or greater rise in RSV antibody titers from baseline.Serum samples were not obtained from two patients that received Palivizumab.All the patients (11) who received RI-001 within 4.2 days after the onset of the diagnosis of RSV survived.The drug was well-tolerated in all 15 patients and there were no reports of serious adverse events attributable to RI-001.Data from our Phase II trial, compassionate use experience and data obtained from the evaluation of RI-002 in the infected cotton rat animal model has been presented at various conferences during 2014, 2015 and 2016. Based on these results, we intend to evaluate RI-002 for the treatment of RSV patientsfollowing FDA approval, if received for treatment of PIDD. Commercialization As part of our current ongoing commercialization efforts, we plan to hire a small, specialty sales force to market RI-002 to hospitals, physician offices/clinics, and other specialty treatment organizations. We anticipate staffing additional personnel for patient support, medical affairs, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, scientific affairs, reimbursement, inventory and logistics, human resources, financial and operational management.If and when we receive FDA approval, we may also use a network of national distributors to fulfill orders for RI-002 for use by healthcare professionals and hospitals. 20 Intellectual Property During the second quarter of 2015, we received a notice of allowance from the United States Patent Office, or USPTO, for our RI-002 patent filed under U.S. patent application 14/592,721 entitled 'Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Immunodeficiency,' which extends through January 2035. During the third quarter of 2015 our U.S. Patent 9,107,906 was issued by the USPTO.This patent describes methods by which the blending of plasma obtained from normal donors with plasma obtained from donors selected to have high levels of neutralizing titers to RSV form a unique antibody enriched plasma pool and provide for the standardization of the levels of anti-RSV antibodies in the RI-002 final product.Our proprietary microneutralization assay allows us to effectively identify and isolate donor plasma with high-titer RSV antibodies and to standardize RI-002's antibody profile, which we believe may enable us to garner a premium price. Plasma Collection Facilities Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA BioCenters, operates two FDA-licensed, German Health Authority, or GHA, and Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MFDS, certified source plasma collection facilities located in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia, which provide us with a portion of our blood plasma for the manufacture of RI-002.Our plasma collection center in Marietta, Georgia, received FDA approval in the third quarter of 2015.A typical plasma collection center, such as those operated byADMA BioCenters, can collect approximately 30,000 to 50,000 liters of source plasma annually, which may be sold for different prices depending upon the type of plasma, quantity of purchase, and market conditions at the time of sale.Plasma collected from ADMA BioCenters' two Georgia facilities that is not used for making RI-002 is sold to third-party customers in the United States,and other locationswhere we are approved globally under supply agreements or in the open "spot" market.We have entered into long-term manufacturing and licensing agreements with Biotest Aktiengesellschaft, or Biotest AG and their United States subsidiary, Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Biotest, that provide for the exclusive manufacture of RI-002.At the same time, we granted Biotest AG an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to market and sell RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in Europe and in other selected territories in North Africa and the Middle East. Financial Operations Overview Revenues Revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are comprised of product revenues from the sale of normal source human plasma collected from our plasma collection centers segment and license revenues attributable to the out-licensing of RI-002 to Biotest AG to market and sell in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East.In exchange for the out-licensing of RI-002, Biotest AG and Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Biotest, a subsidiary of Biotest AG, has provided us with certain financial payment and services in accordance with the related Biotest AG license agreement and is obligated to pay us certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are achieved. 21 Our revenues are primarily attributable to a single customer.Depending on the agreement with the customer, revenues from the sale of human plasma collected at our FDA- licensed plasma collection centers are recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which occurs at the time of shipment.Revenue is recognized at the time of delivery if we retain the risk of loss during shipment.Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement have been completed. Research and Development Expenses Research and development, or R&D expenses, attributable to our R&D segment, consists of clinical research organization costs, clinical trial costs related to our clinical trial, consulting expenses relating to regulatory and medical affairs, quality assurance and control, manufacturing, assay development, ongoing testing costs, drug product manufacturing including the cost of plasma, plasma storage and transportation costs, as well as wages and benefits for employees including stock-based compensation directly related to the R&D of RI-002.All R&D is expensed as incurred. The process of conducting preclinical studies, clinical trials and regulatory activities necessary to obtain FDA approval is costly and time consuming.The probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the quality of the product candidate's early clinical data, investment in the program, competition, regulatory, manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability.As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates.Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely.R&D expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 increased due to higher validation, testing and production costs related to RI-002 along with increased regulatory consulting services related to our BLA.We anticipate R&D expenses may continue to increase throughout 2016 as a result of ongoing regulatoryactivitiesrelated toour BLA along with anticipated expenditures for testing and validation services relating to the costs associated with seeking FDA approval for RI-002 and in procuring plasma from donors with high levels of neutralizing titers to RSV as part of our manufacturing of RI-002. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative, or G&A expenses, consist of wages, stock-based compensation, benefits for senior management and staff unrelated to R&D, legal fees, accounting and auditing fees, commercialization and marketing activities, information technology, investor relations fees, rent, maintenance and utilities, insurance, travel and other expenses related to the general operations of the business.The increased G&A expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are primarily attributable to marketing, commercial planning, increased headcount, wages and benefits for employees, including stock-based compensation and consulting expenses associated with commercialization activities in preparation for anticipated product launch of RI-002 during the second half of 2016, assuming we receive FDA approval of our BLA during such period.We expect that our G&A expenses may continue to increase throughout 2016 as a result of pre-launch, commercial planning activities, market research costs and the hiring of additional staff as part of the commercial development of RI-002. 22 Other Income and Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.Interest expense consists of interest incurred on our notes payable, as well as the amortization of end of term fees, back end fees, value of warrants issued, facility and financing fees.We anticipate other income and expense to remain consistent throughout 2016 as a result of our current outstanding debt and interest earned on investments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We have had limited revenue from operations and we have incurred cumulative losses of $98.0 million since inception.We have funded our operations to date primarily from equity investments, loans from venture debt lenders and loans from our primary stockholders.During May 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stockand we receivednet proceeds of approximately $12.9 million.In May 2016, we amended our LSA with Oxford and borrowed an additional $4.0 million.In March 2015, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $10.2 million from an underwritten public offering from the sale of our common stock.In October 2013, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $26.6 million from our Initial Public Offering, or IPO.In various financings since 2012, we received a total of $20.0 million from venture debt lenders.In February 2012, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $15.3 million from a private placement of our common stock. As of June 30, 2016, we had working capital of $24.4 million, consisting primarily of $12.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $11.3 million of short-term investments, $4.2 million of inventories, $0.8 million of accounts receivable, and $0.6 million of prepaid expenses, offset by $3.3 million of accounts payable, $1.6 million of accrued expenses and $0.1 million of deferred revenue.See also "Future Financing Needs" below. Future Financing Needs We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts of capital on product development, including commercialization activities, procuring raw material plasma, manufacturing, regulatory, consulting fees in connection with our BLA and the potential approval of RI-002, conducting potential future studies and/or clinical trials for our product candidates and purchasing clinical trial materials from our suppliers. Based upon our projected revenue and expenditures for 2016 and 2017, including the ongoing regulatory activities associated with the BLA for RI-002,implementation of our planned potential commercialization and expansion activities, we currently believe that our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable as of the date of this report are sufficient to fund our operations, as currently conducted, into the second half of 2017.This time frame may change based upon our interactions with FDA, potential timing of our commercial manufacturing scale up activities, how aggressively we execute on our regulatory strategy and/or commercial initiatives and when the FDA approves our BLA for RI-002, if at all. 28 We cannot predict with certainty that we will not need to raise additional funds in the future or when we will reach profitability, if at all.Furthermore, if our assumptions underlying our estimated expenses, the timing of FDA resubmission or approval for RI-002 and revenues from RI-002 are incorrect, we may have to raise additional capital sooner than anticipated.Due to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research and development and potential future commercialization of our product candidate, we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our development activities.Our current estimates may be subject to change as circumstances regarding our business requirements evolve. We may decide to raise capital through public or private equity offerings, such financings may only be available on unattractive terms, resulting in significant dilution of stockholders' interests and, in such event, the value and potential future market price of our common stock may decline, or obtain debt financings, or obtain a bank credit facility or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements.Other than our option to borrow an additional $5.0 million through our current LSA with Oxford, as amended, based upon receiving BLA approval by the FDA for RI-002 no later than January 31, 2017, we do not have any existing commitments for future external funding.The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if convertible, could result in dilution to our current stockholders.The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations or other future financing alternatives.Additional equity or debt financing, grants, or corporate collaboration and potential licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our planned clinical trials and delay or abandon potential commercialization efforts of our lead product candidate or other product candidates.We have reported losses since inception in June 2004 through June 30, 2016 of $98.0 million. Financial markets in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia continue to experience disruption, including, among other things, significant volatility in security prices, declining valuations of certain investments, as well as severely diminished liquidity and credit availability.Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions continues to be greatly reduced and local governments and many businesses are still suffering from the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets.The continued instability in the credit and financial market conditions may negatively impact our ability to access capital and credit markets and our ability to manage our cash balance.While we are unable to predict the continued duration and severity of the adverse conditions in the United States and other countries, any of the circumstances mentioned above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows or cash position. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update,or ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on their balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires modified retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. We are currently evaluating the impact the standard may have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 29 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which includes amendments that require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which includes amendments that require an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the changesto the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The standard requires entities to measure most inventory "at the lower of cost and net realizable value," thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures, one of which is net realizable value). The standard is effective for us prospectively beginning January 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires that an entity recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to its customers.In order to achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This update will replace existing revenue recognition guidance under Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, when it becomes effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. The updated standard will permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact of this update on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 30 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, was signed into law.The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies.As an "emerging growth company," we may, under Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards would otherwise apply to private companies.We may take advantage of this extended transition period until the first to occur of the date that we (i) are no longer an "emerging growth company" or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this extended transition period.We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.Our condensed consolidated financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.Until the date that we are no longer an "emerging growth company" or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B), upon issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to our condensed consolidated financial statements and that has a different effective date for public and private companies, we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for non-emerging growth companies and the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and assumptions, including those described below.We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates. Some of the estimates and assumptions we have to make under GAAP require difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results could differ from those estimates.Due to the estimation processes involved, the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period on a straight-line basis. We account for stock options granted to non-employees on a fair value basis using the Black-Scholes option pricing method.The noncash charge to operations for non-employee options with vesting are revalued at the end of each reporting period based upon the change in the fair value of the options and amortized to consulting expense over the related contract service period. 31 For purposes of valuing stock options granted to our employees, non-employees and directors and officers through the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model.We granted options to purchase an aggregate of 15,000 and 100,984 shares of common stock during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. To determine the risk-free interest rate, we utilized the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant with a term consistent with the expected term of our awards.The expected term of the options granted is in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletins 107 and 110, which is based on the average between vesting terms and contractual terms.The expected dividend yield reflects our current and expected future policy for dividends on our common stock.The expected stock price volatility for our stock options was calculated by examining the pro rata historical volatilities for similar publicly traded industry peers and the trading history for our common stock.We will continue to analyze the expected stock price volatility and expected term assumptions.We have not experienced any material forfeitures of stock options and, as such, have not established a forfeiture rate since the stock options currently outstanding are primarily held by our senior management and directors.We will continue to evaluate the effects of such future potential forfeitures, as they may arise, to evaluate our estimated forfeiture rate. Research and Development Costs Our expenses include all R&D costs as incurred, of which such expenses include costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials, regulatory consulting and filing fees, testing, validation and production of RI-002 prior to regulatory approval and the disposition of plasma and equipment for which there is no alternative future use. Revenue Recognition Depending on the agreement with the customer, revenue from the sale of human plasma collected by ADMA BioCenters is recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which usually occurs at the time of shipment. Revenue is recognized at the time of delivery if we retain the risk of loss during shipment. Our revenues are substantially attributable to one customer.Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement with Biotest AG have been completed.During the third quarter 2015, we recorded deferred revenue of $1.5 million in accordance with the Biotest AG license agreement payment we received related to the filing of our BLA with the FDA.Deferred revenue of $1.7 million was recorded in 2013 as a result of certain research and development services provided in accordance with the Biotest AG license agreement.Deferred revenue is recognized over the term of the license.Deferred revenue is amortized into income for a period of approximately 20 years, the term of the Biotest AG license agreement. Accounting for Loan and Security Agreement On June 19, 2015, we entered into the LSA with Oxford for up to $21.0 million and refinanced our existing loan with Hercules.The first tranche of $16.0 million from the Oxford loan was primarily used to repay our existing facility with Hercules and the remaining $5.0 million is available at our option upon RI-002's BLA being approved from the FDA no later than January 31, 2017, which funding would also extend our interest only period for an additional six months pursuant to the May 2016 amendment to the LSA.The LSA bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.80% and (ii) the sum of (a) the three (3) month U.S. LIBOR rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal) on the date occurring on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 7.54% on the outstanding principal balance.We are obligated to begin to repay the principal over 36 months beginning February 1, 2017, unless accelerated as a result of certain events of default. A final payment equal to 8.95% of the funded loan amount is due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment.In the event of the six-month interest only extension, the final payment will be 9.95% of the funded loan, which shall also be due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. In addition, a facility fee of $105,000 was paid at closing.In the event we prepaya loan for any reason, we are obligated to pay a prepayment charge corresponding to a percentage of the principal amount of the loan prepaid, with such percentage being: 3.0% if prepayment occurs through thefirst anniversary of itsfunding, 2.0% if prepayment occurs after the first anniversarythrough the second anniversary of the applicable funding date, and1.0% if prepayment occurs after the second anniversary ofits funding date and prior to itsmaturity date. The loan matures no later than January 1, 2020. The loan is secured by our assets, except for our intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). 32 In connection with the LSA, on June 19, 2015, we issued to Oxford a seven-year warrant, expiring on June 19, 2022, to purchase 74,309 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $8.51 per share.We recorded $367,700 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan.The key assumptions used to value the warrants included, volatility of 57% on our common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of our common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 1.99% and a term of seven years.As a result of prepaying the Hercules loan prior to maturity, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million comprised of debt issuance costs, debt discount related to the warrants issued to Hercules, along with a prepayment penalty. In May 2016, we entered into an amendment to our LSA with Oxford,pursuant to whichwe borrowed an additional $4.0 million, as an extension to theoriginal LSA entered into on June 19, 2015, which brings the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million.In connection therewith, weissued warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to24,800shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to $6.37, which will expire seven years after their issuance on May 13, 2023,and incurred facilityfees of $20,000 as part of accessing the additional financing. In connection with our Prior Loan Agreement and as amended, we issued to Hercules a warrant to purchase 31,750 shares of common stock in December 2012, with an exercise price of $7.56 and in connection with the Prior Loan Agreement and as amended, we issued to Hercules a warrant to purchase an additional 58,000 shares of our common stock, comprised of a warrant to purchase 23,200 shares of common stock issued in February 2014 and a warrant to purchase 34,800 shares of common stock issued in December 2014, each warrant issued under the Prior Loan Agreement and as amended, having an exercise price of $7.50.The warrants expire after 10 years and have piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the warrant.The fair value of the warrants associated with the Prior Loan Agreement were calculated using a lattice-based option model in order to account for features in the warrant that could cause the exercise price to reset ("down round warrant protection") as a result of the next issuance of our common stock ("the next round of equity financing"). We initially recorded the fair value of the warrant of $219,588 as warrant liability and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan.The key assumptions used to value the warrants included the expected date of the next round of equity financing, volatility of 59% for our common stock based upon similar public companies' volatilities for comparison, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 2.53% and a term of 10 years.As of December 31, 2014, we recorded $476,760 as the fair value of the warrant for the purchase of 58,000 shares of common stock.As a result of the increase in warrant liability, we recorded an expense of $74,356 from the change in the fair value of warrant liability.During the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, we recorded $408,900 as the fair value of the warrant for the purchase of 58,000 shares of common stock.As a result of the decrease in warrant liability, we recorded a change in the fair value of stock warrants of $67,860 from the December 31, 2014 balance.The key assumptions used to value the warrants included the expected date of the next round of equity financing, volatility of 58% based upon a pro rata percentage of our common stock and similar public companies' volatilities, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a risk-free rate of 1.99% and a term of 10 years.This warrant liability was adjusted from the date of the Prior Loan Agreement on February 24, 2014, to fair value each reporting period using a lattice-based option model and the debt discount will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The down round warrant protection feature resulting in the warrant liability's quarterly "mark-to-market" valuation has terminated as of February 24, 2015, which was the end of the one-year period following the amended loan closing on February 24, 2014 and as a result the warrant liability of $408,900 was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. 33 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have entered into leases for our ADMA BioCenters' facilities in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia.The Norcross, Georgia lease expires on September 30, 2023, and the Marietta, Georgia lease expires on January 31, 2024.There is a total minimum rent due under these leases of $2.8 million through the end of the lease terms.Item 1.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS ADMA Biologics, Inc. ("ADMA" or the "Company") is a late stage biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and intends to commercialize specialty plasma-based biologics for the proposed treatment of immune deficiencies and prevention of certain infectious diseases. The Company's targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disease or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. ADMA also operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA BioCenters Georgia, Inc., ("ADMA BioCenters"), a source plasma collection business with U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approved facilities in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia.Each facility holds certifications from the German Health Authority ("GHA") and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety ("MFDS").ADMA BioCenters supplies ADMA with a portion of its raw material plasma for the manufacture of RI-002, ADMA's lead product candidate, which the Company is currently developing for the treatment of Primary Immune Deficiency Disease ("PIDD"). A Biologics License Application ("BLA") for RI-002 was submitted to the FDA and accepted for review during the third quarter of 2015.In July 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter ("CRL") to the Company for its BLA for RI-002.The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety and efficacy data for RI-002, nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical studies be conducted prior to FDA approval of RI-002 for PIDD.In its letter, among other things, the FDA focused on outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies at ADMA's third-party vendors, including the Company's contract drug substance and product manufacturer and its contract fill and finish provider and compliance issues with a third-party contract testing laboratory, and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues.The FDA indicated that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things, these deficiencies are resolved.The Company continues to collaborate with its third-party vendors to identify solutions to the issues identified in the CRL and is preparing documentation for submission to the FDA to address the CRL. The Company and its vendors are awaiting certain feedback from the agency on submissions already made and the Company intends to provide a timeline for resubmission of the BLA for RI-002 as soon as practicable. In May 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million, and subsequently borrowed an additional $4.0 million under its Loan and Security Agreement ("LSA") with Oxford Finance LLC ("Oxford"), which brought the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million.See Footnote 3. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital of $20.6 million, consisting primarily of $7.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $11.0 million of short-term investments, $4.6 million of inventories, $1.3 million of accounts receivable and $0.5 million of prepaid expenses, offset primarily by $2.8 million of accounts payable, $1.8 million of accrued expenses and $0.1 million of deferred revenue.Based upon the Company's projected revenue and expenditures for 2016 and 2017, including regulatory and consulting fees for RI-002 associated with third-party manufacturers and ongoing discussions with the FDA, continuing implementation of the Company's commercialization and expansion activities and certain other assumptions, management currently believes that its cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, projected revenue and accounts receivable are sufficient to fund ADMA's operations, as currently conducted, into the second half of 2017.These estimates may change based upon whether or when the FDA approves RI-002, the timing of any required commercial manufacturing scale up activities or if any other assumptions of the Company change. The Company has the option to borrow an additional $5.0 million through its current LSA, if RI-002 is approved by the FDA prior to January 31, 2017, which funding would also extend its interest only period for an additional six months pursuant to the May 2016 amendment to the LSA.Other than this additional $5.0 million, the Company does not have any existing commitments for future funding.In addition to traditional debt financing, the Company may also sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, each of which could result in dilution to the Company's stockholders.The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and if issued outside the LSA, could also result in additional covenants that would restrict the Company's operations or other financing alternatives.Additional equity or debt financing, grants, or corporate collaboration and potential licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate the Company's research and development programs, and delay or abandon potential commercialization efforts of the Company's lead or other product candidates.The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception in 2004 and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.Since inception, the Company has raised capital from the sales of its equity securities and debt financings to sustain operations. The Company has reported cumulative losses since inception in June 2004 through September 30, 2016 of $102.4 million.ADMA's long-term liquidity will be dependent upon on its ability to obtain FDA approval for RI-002, to generate sales of RI-002 and potentially raise additional capital, to fund its research and development and commercial programs and to meet its obligations on a timely basis, if at all. 5 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 There can be no assurance that the Company's research and development and commercial programs will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or, if approved, be commercially viable.The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, dependence on collaborative arrangements and third-party manufacturers, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with FDA and other governmental regulations and approval requirements. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADMA and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, ADMA Plasma Biologics, Inc. and ADMA BioCenters.All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) which in the opinion of management are necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016 and their results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, changes in stockholders' (deficiency) equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim periods or for the full year.These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 23, 2016.The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, was derived from the 2015 audited consolidated financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim reporting.Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in complete annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted. 6 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 Inventories Plasma inventories (both plasma intended for resale and plasma intended for internal use intheCompany'sresearch and development and future anticipated commercialization activities of which certain quantities are labeled as normal source and Respiratory Syncytial Virus, ("RSV")high titer) are carried at the lower of cost or market value determined by the first-in, first-out method.Research and development plasma used in clinical trials was processed to a finished product and subsequently expensed to research and development.Inventory at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consists of high titer RSV plasma and normal source plasma. Revenue recognition Depending on the agreement with the customer, product revenues from the sale of human plasma collected at the Company's FDA-licensed plasma collection centers are recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which occurs at the time of shipment.Product revenues are recognized at the time of delivery if the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment.The Company's product revenues are substantially attributable to two customers.One customer accounts for greater than eighty percent and another customer accounts for greater than ten percent of the Company's product revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement have been completed. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are comprised of product revenues from the sale of normal source human plasma collected from the Company's plasma collection centers segment and license and other revenues are primarily attributable to the out-licensing of RI-002 to Biotest Aktiengesellschaft ("Biotest AG") to market and sell in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East.Biotest AG and Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("Biotest"), a subsidiary of Biotest AG, have provided the Company with certain services and financial payments in accordance with the related Biotest AG license agreement and is obligated to pay the Company certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are achieved.During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded deferred revenue of $1.5 million for a milestone payment provided to the Company after the BLA for RI-002 was filed with the FDA, in accordance with the terms of the Biotest AG license agreement. Deferred revenue is recognized over the term of the Biotest AG license.Deferred revenue is amortized into income for a period of approximately 20 years, the term of the Biotest AG license agreement. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates.Significant estimates include valuation of inventory, assumptions used in the fair value determination of stock-based compensation, warrants and the allowance for the valuation of future tax benefits. Loss per common share Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, if any, by the weighted average number of common stock and dilutive common stock outstanding during the period.Potential common stock includes the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method).Potential common stock in the diluted net loss per share computation is excluded to the extent that it would be anti-dilutive.No potentially dilutive securities are included in the computation of any diluted per share amounts as the Company reported a net loss for all periods presented.The aggregate number of potentially dilutive securities upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options was 1.8 million and 1.6 million as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 7 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 Stock-based compensation The Company follows recognized accounting guidance which requires all stock-based payments, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense, based on their fair values on the grant date. The estimated fair value of stock options granted under the Company's 2007 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "2007 Plan") and the Company's 2014 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2014 Plan") is recognized as compensation expense over the option-vesting period. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not grant stock options and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted stock options to purchase 100,984 shares of common stock to its directors and employees.During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company granted stock options to purchase 81,500 and 312,500 shares of common stock, respectively, to its directors and employees. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update,or ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718), whichprovides for simplification of certain aspects of employee share-based payment accounting including income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017 and will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition approach depending on the area covered in this update. The Company is currently in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2016-09 on the Company's financial statements and related disclosures. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on their balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires modified retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the standard may have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which includes amendments that require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 8 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which includes amendments that require an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the changesto the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance.The Company is currently evaluating the impact the standard may have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The standard requires entities to measure most inventory "at the lower of cost and net realizable value," thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures, one of which is net realizable value). The standard is effective for the Company prospectively beginning January 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset.Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 in its second quarter 2015 condensed consolidated financial statements and recast the prior period balances to conform to the current period presentation. In August2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable). Further, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is "substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern." The FASB believes that requiring management to perform the assessment will enhance the timeliness, clarity, and consistency of related disclosures and improve convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") (which emphasize management's responsibility for performing the going-concern assessment). However, the time horizon for the assessment (look-forward period) and the disclosure thresholds under GAAP and IFRSs will continue to differ. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial statements. 9 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires that an entity recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to its customers.In order to achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This update will replace existing revenue recognition guidance underGAAP, when it becomes effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. The updated standard will permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 3. DEBT Loan and Security Agreement On June 19, 2015, the Company entered into an LSA with Oxford for up to $21.0 million of debt financing in two term loan tranches.The first term loan tranche of $16.0 million from the LSA (the "Term A Loan") was primarily used to repay the Company'sprevious debt facility and the remaining $5.0 million term loan tranche is available at ADMA's option if RI-002's BLA is approved by the FDA on or before January 31, 2017, which funding would also extend the interest only period for an additional six months pursuant to the May 2016 amendment to the LSA described below. The outstanding term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.80% and (ii) the sum of (a) the three month U.S. LIBOR rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal) on the date occurring on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 7.54% on the outstanding principal balance.The Company is obligated to begin to repay the principal over 36 months beginning on February 1, 2017, unless accelerated as a result of certain events of default. A final payment equal to 8.95% of the funded loan amount is due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment.In the event of the six-month interest only extension, the final payment will be 9.95% of the funded loan, which shall also be due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. All term loans mature no later than January 1, 2020. The loans are secured by the Company's assets, except for its intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). The LSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including limitations on incurring indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions and making investments, distributions or transfers. In connection with the entry into the LSA, on June 19, 2015, the Company issued to Oxford a seven-year warrant, expiring on June 19, 2022, to purchase 74,309 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $8.51 per share. The Company recorded $367,700 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan.The key assumptions used to value the warrants included: volatility of 57% on the Company's common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of the Company's common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 1.99% and a term of seven years.As a result of prepaying the Company'sprior loan before maturity, the Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million comprised of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized debt discount related to the warrants issued to the Company's prior lender, along with a prepayment penalty. 10 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 In May 2016, the Company amended the LSA with Oxford ("the Amended LSA") which provided ADMA with an additional $4.0 million term loan (the "Term B Loan"), the availability of which was conditioned on completing an equity financing of its common stock of at least $10.0 million in gross proceeds no later than May 31, 2016.On May 3, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million and subsequently borrowed the additional $4.0 million from Oxford under the Amended LSA, which brings the total principal amount borrowed to $20.0 million.Under the Amended LSA, the Company may borrow an additional aggregate amount up to $5.0 million (the "Term C Loan"), at its option during the period commencing on the date the Company's BLA for RI-002 is approved by the FDA and ending on the earlier of (i) January 31, 2017, (ii) 30 days after the occurrence of such FDA approval and (iii) the occurrence of an event of default under the Amended LSA, in which case the additional loan amount would not be available while the event of default continues.Upon the Company accessing the additional $5.0 million, the interest only period will be extended from February 1, 2017 to August 1, 2017. In the event the Company prepaysa term loan for any reason, the Company is obligated to pay a prepayment charge corresponding to a percentage of the principal amount of the applicableterm loan prepaid.The Amended LSA further modified the fees payable by the Company on mandatory or voluntary prepayment of a term loan prior to its maturity date as follows:(i) for a prepayment made on or after the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the first anniversary of its funding date, an amount equal to 3.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid; (ii) for a prepayment made after the first anniversary of the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the second anniversary of such funding date, an amount equal to 2.00% of the principal amount of such term loan prepaid; and (iii) for a prepayment of a term loan made after the second anniversary of its funding date and prior to its maturity date, an amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid. Pursuant to the Amended LSA, (i) the Company paid a total facility fee of $125,000, consisting of $105,000 previously paid and an additional $20,000 paid on the date the Term B Loan was funded; (ii) certain adjustments were made to the time periods for any applicable prepayment fees; and (iii) certain defined terms were adjusted, including a new Amortization Date that is defined as(a) February 17, 2017, if the Term C Loan is not made and (b) August 1, 2017 if the Term C Loan is made.The Amended LSA further provides for customary representations, warranties and covenants for the Company.Except as otherwise amended, the Amended LSA does not alter the terms of the LSA. In addition, on May 13, 2016, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the LSA as modified by the Amended LSA, the Company agreed to issue to the lenders warrants to purchase shares of its common stock, upon its draw of each term loan tranche. The aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is equal to 3.95% of the amount drawn of such tranche, divided by the average reported closing price per share of common stock for the consecutive 10 trading days prior to the applicable draw. In connection with the Amended LSA, on May 13, 2016, the Company issued to Oxford a seven- year warrant, expiring on May 23, 2023, to purchase 24,800 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.37 per share, in accordance with the Company's drawdown of the Term B Loan. The Company recorded $86,300 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan.The key assumptions used to value the warrants included: volatility of 53.5% on the Company's common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of the Company's common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 1.51% and a term of seven years. 11 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 A summary of the Oxford loan balance as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is as follows: 4. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY On May 3, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 2,176,154 shares of its common stock, for gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million.Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $13.0 million, after payment of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million.The shares were sold under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200638) that was declared effective by the SEC on December 23, 2014. On March 18, 2015, the Company announced the closing of an underwritten sale of 1,225,000 shares of its common stock, as well as 183,750 additional shares of its common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters thereof, for gross proceeds of approximately $11.3 million. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $10.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million. The shares were sold under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200638) that was declared effective by the SEC on December 23, 2014. Oxford Debt Financing Warrant Issuance In May 2016, the Company issued to Oxford warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 24,800 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal to $6.37 per share. The warrants became exercisable on May 13, 2016 for cash or by net exercise and will expire seven years after their issuance on May 13, 2023. Equity incentive plan The fair value of employee options granted was determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.The Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.Because there has been minimal data for the Company's stock and very little historical experience with the Company's stock options, similar public companies and a pro rata percentage of the Company'scommon stock were used for calculating ADMA's volatility for comparison and expectations as to the assumptions required for fair value computation using the Black-Scholes methodology. 12 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 Guidance for stock-based compensation requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.The Company has not experienced any material forfeitures of stock options and, as such, has not established a forfeiture rate since the stock options currently outstanding are primarily held by its senior management and directors.The Company will continue to evaluate the effects of such future potential forfeitures, as they may arise, to evaluate its estimated forfeiture rate. The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options outstanding and expected to vest at September 30, 2016 is 6.6 years.The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options exercisable at September 30, 2016 is 5.8 years. A summary of the Company's option activity under the 2007 Plan and 2014 Plan and related information is as follows: Stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: As of September 30, 2016, the total compensation expense related to unvested options not yet recognized totaled $1,870,323. The weighted average vesting period over which the total compensation expense will be recorded related to unvested options not yet recognized at September 30, 2016 was approximately 2.3 years. 13 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company leases an office building and equipment from an entity owned by related parties on a month-to-month basis of which terms were amended by the Company's Board of Directors in June 2016.Rent expense amounted to $48,000 and $24,112 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $144,000 and $72,336 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The Company also reimburses its landlord for office and building related (common area) expenses, equipment and certain other operational expenses, which have been insignificant to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.The Company maintains deposits and other accounts at a bank whichwas less than 5%-owned by related parties through January 2016,and where a stockholder and Company director was previously a member of the bank'sboard of directors through January 2016, and is now a member of its Corporate Advisory Council. 6.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on March 23, 2016. Forward-Looking Statements This quarterly report on Form10-Q contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, orthe Securities Act, and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.The forward-looking statements are only predictions and provide our current expectations or forecasts of future events and financial performance and may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms "believes," "estimates," "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "intends," "may," "will" or "should" or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology, though the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking.Forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts and include, without limitation, statements concerning our business strategy, outlook, objectives, future milestones, plans, intentions, goals, and future financial condition, including the period of time for which our existing resources will enable us to fund our operations.Forward-looking statements also include our financial, clinical, manufacturing and distribution plans and our expectations and timing related to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, review and approval process and commercialization of RI-002. We intend that all forward-looking statements be subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Forward-looking statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements.They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance.Examples of the risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully resubmit to the FDA, our Biologics License Application, or BLA, for RI-002 once the deficiencies identified in the July 2016 Complete Response Letter, or CRL, have been resolved by us and/or our third party vendors to the satisfaction of the FDA, and other requests for information included therein have been provided by us, our plans to develop, market, launch and build our own commercial infrastructure and commercialize RI-002 and the success of such efforts, the expected timing of and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, including the timeframe within which we may receive approval from the FDA, if at all, of our BLA for RI-002 and the labeling or nature of any such approvals, the achievement of or expected timing, progress and results of clinical development, clinical trials and potential regulatory approvals, 17 our dependence upon one manufacturer for RI-002 and the effect any adverse events on such manufacturer could have on us or our business, our dependence upon our third-party contract manufacturers and vendors, our ability to obtain adequate quantities of FDA-approved normal source plasma and Respiratory Syncytical Virus, or RSV, high-titer plasma with proper specifications, our plans to increase our supplies of plasma, the potential indications for our product candidates, potential investigational new product applications, the acceptability of RI-002 for any purpose by physicians, patients or payers, concurrence by FDA with our conclusions and the satisfaction by us of its guidance, the comparability of results of RI-002 to other comparably run injectable immune globulin clinical trials, the potential of RI-002 to provide meaningful clinical improvement for patients living with Primary Immune Deficiency Disease, or PIDD, our intellectual property position, including our expectations of the scope of patent protection with respect to RI-002, or other future pipeline product candidates, our manufacturing capabilities, third-party contractor capabilities and strategy, our plans relating to manufacturing, supply and other collaborative agreements, our estimates regarding expenses, capital requirements and needs for additional financing, possible or likely reimbursement levels, if any, if and when RI-002 is approved for marketing, estimates regarding market size, projected growth and sales as well as our expectations of market acceptance of RI-002; and expectations for future capital requirements. Pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device technology companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising earlier trial results.Data obtained from such clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.After gaining approval of a drug product, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies face considerable challenges in marketing and distributing their products, and may never become profitable.You should read carefully the factors described in the "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 23, 2016, our Quarterly Report for thequarter ended June 30, 2016 on Form 10-Q, as filed with the SEC on August 12, 2016, our Current Report on Form 8-K, as filed with the SEC on April 27, 2016 and in other filings with the SEC to better understand significant risks and uncertainties inherent in our business and underlying any forward-looking statements. As a result of these factors, actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements in this report and you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. 18 Any forward-looking statements that we make in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q speak only as of the date of such statements and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements or to publicly announce revisions to any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition to the risks identified under the heading "Risk Factors" in the SEC filings referenced previously, many important factors affect our ability to achieve our plans and objectives and to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, our results may be affected by our ability to manage our financial resources, difficulties or delays in developing manufacturing processes for our product candidates, preclinical and toxicology testing and regulatory developments.Delays in clinical programs, whether caused by competitive developments, adverse events, patient enrollment rates, regulatory issues or other factors, could adversely affect our financial position and prospects.Prior clinical trial program designs and results are not necessarily indicative of future clinical trial designs or results. If our product candidates do not meet safety or efficacy endpoints in clinical evaluations, they will not receive regulatory approval and we will not be able to market them. The FDA may not approve our BLA for RI-002, our data, our results, or permit us to proceed.We may not be able to enter into any strategic partnership agreements. Operating expenses and cash flow projections involve a high degree of uncertainty, including variances in future spending rates due to changes in corporate priorities, the timing and outcomes of clinical trials, competitive developments and the impact on expenditures and available capital from licensing and strategic collaboration opportunities.If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue one or more of our drug development or discovery research programs and delay or abandon potential commercialization efforts.We may not ever have any products that generate significant revenue. Therefore, current and prospective security holders are cautioned that there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this document will prove to be accurate. Overview We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and intends to commercialize specialty plasma-based biologics for the proposed treatment of immune deficiencies and prevention of certain infectious diseases. Our targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disorder or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. Our product candidates are intended to be used by physician specialists focused on caring for immune-compromised patients with or at risk for certain infectious diseases. Our Lead Product Candidate RI-002 We are currently developing our lead product candidate, RI-002, for the treatment of PIDD, and have completed a pivotal Phase III clinical study.RI-002 is derived from human plasma blended from normal donors and donors tested to have high levels of neutralizing titers to RSV.RI-002 is manufactured using a process called fractionation, which purifies immune globulins, or IgG, from this blended plasma pool resulting in a final IVIG product enriched with naturally occurring polyclonal anti-pathogen antibodies (e.g., streptococcus pneumonia, H. influenza type B, Cytomegalovirus or CMV, measles, tetanus, etc.).We use our proprietary RSV microneutralization assay to test for standardized levels of neutralizing antibodies to RSV in the final drug product. 19 In the third quarter of 2015, the FDA accepted for review a BLA for RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD.In July 2016, the FDA issued a CRL.The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety or efficacy data for RI-002 submitted in the BLA, nor did the FDA request any additional clinical studies be completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002.The FDA identified in the CRL, among other things, certain outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies at our third-party contract manufacturers and vendors and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues.The FDA indicated in the CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things,these deficiencies are resolved. We continue to collaborate with our third-party manufacturers and vendors to identify solutions to outstanding issues identified in the CRL.We are currently preparing documentation for an additional submission to the FDA to address the CRL.We, along with our vendors, are awaiting certain feedback from the FDA regarding previous submissions and we intend to provide a timeline for resubmission of our BLA for RI-002 as soon as practicable.If RI-002 is approved by the FDA, we intend to commercialize RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD and explore alternative processes to evaluate and seek approval for RI-002 for additional indications, patient populations and uses. Evaluation of PIDD Patients PIDD, a genetic disorder that causes a deficient or absent immune system, is caused by hereditary or genetic defects and can affect anyone regardless of age or gender.PIDD patients are more vulnerable to infections and more likely to suffer complications from these infections.IVIG is a plasma derived product that is used to prevent serious infections in patients with PIDD.It is comprised of polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins produced by B-cells that are used by the body's immune system to neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses.It is estimated that there are about 250,000 diagnosed PIDD patients in the United States, approximately half of whom are treated with IVIG regularly.In the United States, sales of immune globulin products for all its uses were reported to be approximately $4.8 billion in 2014. The RI-002 pivotal Phase III clinical trial was conducted as a single arm study in which patients were treated approximately once per month for a period of 12 months plus 90 days for follow up.Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in nine treatment centers in the United States.The pivotal Phase III primary endpoint followed published FDA industry guidance, which provides for a reduction in the incidence of serious infections to less than one per year in each subject receiving IVIG.The secondary outcome was safety and included other pharmacokinetic, or PK, data collection points including antibody titers for certain agents, including RSV antibody levels at various time points after infusion. RI-002 demonstrated positive results in the Phase III study in patients with PIDD, meeting its primary endpoint, of noSerious Bacterial Infections, or SBI,reported.RI-002 was administered a total of 793 infusions with zero serious adverse events to 59 patients in nine treatment centers throughout the United States.These results, included in the BLA, more than meet the requirement specified by FDA guidance of 1 SBI per patient-year. 20 On February 22, 2015, at the 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Annual Meeting, scientific investigators reported on the secondary outcomes that included: a total of 93 days, or 1.66 days per patient per year lost from work or school due to infection; one hospitalization due to an infection of only five days duration in the entire study and IgG trough levels above those required by the FDA for IVIG products.Additionally, there was a marked increase in all of the measured specific anti-pathogen antibodies in PK subjects (n=31). The mean of maximum fold increases in specific antibody levels after infusion of RI-002 ranged from 1.9 fold (S. pneumonia type 19A) to 5.3 fold (RSV), which were statistically significant fold increases from the pathogen's specific measured baselines.The safety profile of RI-002 is comparable to that of other immunoglobulins. Rationale for the Potential Evaluation in RSV Infected Patients RSV is a common virus that ordinarily leads to mild, cold-like symptoms in healthy adults and children.In high-risk groups, such as the PIDD population and the other immune-compromised populations, RSV can lead to a more serious infection and may even cause death. The polyclonal antibodies which are present in RI-002 are expected to prevent infections in immune-compromised patients. We previously conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to evaluate RI-001, RI-002's predecessor product candidate, in immune-compromised, RSV-infected patients. This trial was conducted with 21 patients in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Phase II dose-ranging trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline RSV titers to day 18 in the high dose and low dose treatment groups when compared with placebo (p=0.0043 and p=0.0268, respectively). The mean fold increase for high dose was 9.24 (95% CI 4.07, 21.02) and the observed mean fold increase for low dose was 4.85 (95% CI 2.22, 10.59). The mean fold change for placebo treated patients was 1.42 (95% CI 0.64, 3.17). In addition, more patients in the high dose (85.7%) and low dose (42.9%) groups experienced greater than a four-fold increase from baseline to day 18 in RSV titer levels compared to placebo (0%). There were no serious drug-related adverse events reported during the trial. From April 2009 through February 2011, RI-001 was also administered to 15 compassionate use patients where physicians requested access to the product for treating their patients with documented lower respiratory tract RSV infections due to the fact that these patients had failed conventional therapeutic interventions.Serum samples were obtained from 13 patients.Samples showed that patients demonstrated a four-fold or greater rise in RSV antibody titers from baseline.Serum samples were not obtained from two patients that received Palivizumab.All 11 patients who received RI-001 within 4.2 days after the onset of the diagnosis of RSV survived.The drug was well-tolerated in all 15 patients and there were no reports of serious adverse events attributable to RI-001.Data from our Phase II clinical trial, compassionate use experience and data obtained from the evaluation of RI-002 in the infected cotton rat animal model has been presented at various conferences during 2014, 2015 and 2016. Based on these results, we intend to evaluate RI-002 for the treatment of RSV patients following FDA approval, if received, for treatment of PIDD. 21 Commercialization As part of our current ongoing commercialization efforts, we plan to hire a small, specialty sales force to market RI-002 to hospitals, physician offices/clinics, and other specialty treatment organizations.We anticipate staffing additional personnel for patient support, medical affairs, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, scientific affairs, reimbursement, inventory and logistics, human resources, financial and operational management.If and when we receive FDA approval, we may also use a network of national distributors to fulfill orders for RI-002 for use by healthcare professionals and hospitals. Intellectual Property During the second quarter of 2015, we received a notice of allowance from the United States Patent Office, or USPTO, for our RI-002 patent filed under U.S. patent application 14/592,721 entitled 'Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Immunodeficiency,' which extends through January 2035. During the third quarter of 2015 our U.S. Patent 9,107,906 was issued by the USPTO.This patent describes methods by which the blending of plasma obtained from normal donors with plasma obtained from donors selected to have high levels of neutralizing titers to RSV form a unique antibody enriched plasma pool and provide for the standardization of the levels of anti-RSV antibodies in the RI-002 final product.Our proprietary microneutralization assay allows us to effectively identify and isolate donor plasma with high-titer RSV antibodies and to standardize RI-002's antibody profile, which we believe may enable us to garner a premium price. Plasma Collection Facilities Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA BioCenters, operates two FDA-licensed, German Health Authority, or GHA, and Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MFDS, certified source plasma collection facilities located in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia, which provide us with a portion of our blood plasma for the manufacture of RI-002.Our plasma collection center in Marietta, Georgia, received FDA approval in the third quarter of 2015.A typical plasma collection center, such as those operated byADMA BioCenters, can collect approximately 30,000 to 50,000 liters of source plasma annually, which may be sold for different prices depending upon the type of plasma, quantity of purchase, and market conditions at the time of sale.Plasma collected from ADMA BioCenters' two Georgia facilities that is not used for making RI-002 is sold to third-party customers in the United States,and other locationswhere we are approved globally under supply agreements or in the open "spot" market.We have entered into long-term manufacturing and licensing agreements with Biotest Aktiengesellschaft, or Biotest AG and their United States subsidiary, Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Biotest, that provide for the exclusive manufacture of RI-002.At the same time, we granted Biotest AG an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to market and sell RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in Europe and in other selected territories in North Africa and the Middle East. Financial Operations Overview Revenues Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are comprised of product revenues from the sale of normal source human plasma collected from our plasma collection centers segment and license revenues attributable to the out-licensing of RI-002 to Biotest AG to market and sell in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East.In exchange for the out-licensing of RI-002, Biotest AG and Biotest, a subsidiary of Biotest AG, have provided us with certain financial payment and services in accordance with the related Biotest AG license agreement and is obligated to pay us certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are achieved. 22 Our product revenues are primarily attributable to two customers.One customer accounts for greater than eighty percent and another customer accounts for greater than ten percent of our product revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.Product revenuesfrom the sale of human plasma collected at our FDA-licensed plasma collection centers are recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which occurs, depending on the agreement with the customer, at the time of shipment orat the time of delivery if we retain the risk of loss during shipment.Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement have been completed. Research and Development Expenses Research and development, or R&D expenses, attributable to our R&D segment, consists of clinical research organization costs, clinical trial costs related to our clinical trial, consulting expenses relating to regulatory and medical affairs, quality assurance and control, manufacturing, assay development, ongoing testing costs, drug product manufacturing including the cost of plasma, plasma storage and transportation costs, as well as wages and benefits for employees including stock-based compensation directly related to the R&D of RI-002.All R&D costs are expensed as incurred. The process of conducting preclinical studies, clinical trials and regulatory activities necessary to obtain FDA approval is costly and time consuming.The probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the quality of the product candidate's early clinical data, investment in the program, competition, regulatory, manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability.As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, the uncertainties associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates.Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely.R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased as compared to R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of reduced testing and validation services related to RI-002 attributed to us managing costs after we received the CRL to our BLA for RI-002.For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, R&D expenses increased as compared to R&D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, due to higher validation, testing and production costs related to RI-002 along with increased regulatory consulting services related to our BLA.We anticipate that R&D expenses may continue to decrease throughout 2016 as a result of reduced testing and validation services related to RI-002 offset by increased costs related to regulatory activities in connection with the CRL. Once we have clarity for the timing of our expected BLA resubmission and anticipated RI-002 approval, we would then expect our R&D costs to increase. 23 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative, or G&A expenses, consist of wages, stock-based compensation, benefits for senior management and staff unrelated to R&D, legal fees, accounting and auditing fees, commercialization and marketing activities, information technology, investor relations fees, rent, maintenance and utilities, insurance, travel and other expenses related to the general operations of our business.The decreased G&A expenses for the three months September 30, 2016 is attributed to us managing costs, primarily related to pre-launch commercialization and related activities, after we received the CRL.For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, G&A increased as a result of higher marketing, commercial planning, increased headcount, wages and benefits for employees, including stock-based compensation and consulting expenses associated with commercialization activities.We expect that our G&A expenses may continue to decrease modestly throughout 2016 as we continue to manage our costs through deferringcertain pre-launch, and commercial planning activities, while we focus on addressing the CRL.Once we have clarity for the timing of our expected BLA resubmission and anticipated RI-002 approval, we would then expect our G&A costs to increase. Other Income and Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.Interest expense consists of interest incurred on our notes payable, as well as the amortization of end of term fees, back end fees, value of warrants issued, facility and financing fees.We anticipate other income and expense to remain consistent throughout 2016 as a result of our current outstanding debt and interest earned on investments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We have had limited revenue from operations and we have incurred cumulative losses of $102.4 million since inception.We have funded our operations to date primarily from equity investments, loans from venture debt lenders and loans from our primary stockholders.During May 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock and we received net proceeds of approximately $12.9 million.In May 2016, we amended our Loan and Security Agreement, or LSA, with Oxford and borrowed an additional $4.0 million.In March 2015, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $10.2 million from an underwritten public offering from the sale of our common stock.In October 2013, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $26.6 million from our Initial Public Offering, or IPO.In various financings since 2012, we received a total of $20.0 million from venture debt lenders.In February 2012, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $15.3 million from a private placement of our common stock. As of September 30, 2016, we had working capital of $20.6 million, consisting primarily of $7.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $11.0 million of short-term investments, $4.6 million of inventories, $1.3 million of accounts receivable, and $0.5 million of prepaid expenses, offset by $2.8 million of accounts payable, $1.8 million of accrued expenses and $0.1 million of deferred revenue.See also "Future Financing Needs" below. Future Financing Needs We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts of capital on product development, including commercialization activities, procuring raw material plasma, manufacturing, regulatory, consulting fees in connection with our BLA and the potential approval of RI-002, conducting potential future studies and/or clinical trials for our product candidates and purchasing clinical trial materials from our suppliers.Based upon our projected revenue and expenditures for 2016 and 2017, including the ongoing regulatory activities associated with pursuing the BLA for RI-002, implementation of our planned potential commercialization and expansion activities, we currently believe that our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable as of the date of this report are sufficient to fund our operations, as currently conducted, into the second half of 2017.This time frame may change based upon our interactions with FDA, potential timing of our commercial manufacturing scale up activities, our generation of future revenue, how aggressively we execute on our regulatory strategy and/or commercial initiatives and when the FDA approves our BLA for RI-002, if at all. We cannot predict with certainty that we will not need to raise additional funds in the future or when we will reach profitability, if at all.Furthermore, if our assumptions underlying our estimated expenses, the timing of FDA resubmission or approval for RI-002 and generation of revenues from RI-002 are incorrect, we may have to raise additional capital sooner than anticipated.Due to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research and development and potential future commercialization of our product candidate, we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our development activities.Our current estimates may be subject to change as circumstances regarding our business requirements evolve. We may decide to raise capital through public or private equity offerings, such financings may only be available on unattractive terms, resulting in significant dilution of stockholders' interests and, in such event, the value and potential future market price of our common stock may decline, or we may decide to obtain debt financings or a bank credit facility or to enter into corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements.Other than our option to borrow an additional $5.0 million through our current LSA with Oxford, as amended, based upon receiving BLA approval by the FDA for RI-002 no later than January 31, 2017, we do not have any existing commitments for future external funding.The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if convertible, could result in dilution to our current stockholders.The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations or other future financing alternatives.Additional equity or debt financing, grants, or corporate collaboration and potential licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. 30 If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our planned clinical trials and delay or abandon potential commercialization efforts of our lead product candidate or other product candidates. Financial markets in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia continue to experience disruption, including, among other things, significant volatility in security prices, declining valuations of certain investments, as well as severely diminished liquidity and credit availability.Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions continues to be greatly reduced and local governments and many businesses are still suffering from the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets.Instability in the credit and financial market conditions may negatively impact our ability to access capital and credit markets and our ability to manage our cash balance.While we are unable to predict the continued duration and severity of the adverse conditions in the United States and other countries, any of the circumstances mentioned above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows or cash position. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update,or ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718), whichprovides for simplification of certain aspects of employee share-based payment accounting including income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017 and will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition approach depending on the area covered in this update. We are currently in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2016-09 on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on their balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires modified retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. We are currently evaluating the impact the standard may have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 31 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which includes amendments that require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which includes amendments that require an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the changesto the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance.We are currently evaluating the impact the standard may have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The standard requires entities to measure most inventory "at the lower of cost and net realizable value," thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures, one of which is net realizable value). The standard is effective for us prospectively beginning January 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted ASU 2015-03 in our second quarter 2015 condensed consolidated financial statements and recast the prior period balances to conform to the current period presentation. 32 In August2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable). Further, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is "substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern." The FASB believes that requiring management to perform the assessment will enhance the timeliness, clarity, and consistency of related disclosures and improve convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS (which emphasize management's responsibility for performing the going-concern assessment). However, the time horizon for the assessment (look-forward period) and the disclosure thresholds under Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and IFRSs will continue to differ. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires that an entity recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to its customers.In order to achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This update will replace existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP, when it becomes effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. The updated standard will permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact of this update on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, was signed into law.The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies.As an "emerging growth company," we may, under Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards would otherwise apply to private companies.We may take advantage of this extended transition period until the first to occur of the date that we (i) are no longer an "emerging growth company" or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this extended transition period.We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.Our condensed consolidated financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.Until the date that we are no longer an "emerging growth company" or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B), upon issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to our condensed consolidated financial statements and that has a different effective date for public and private companies, we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for non-emerging growth companies and the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard. 33 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and assumptions, including those described below.We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates. Some of the estimates and assumptions we have to make under GAAP require difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results could differ from those estimates.Due to the estimation processes involved, the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period on a straight-line basis. We account for stock options granted to non-employees on a fair value basis using the Black-Scholes option pricing method.The noncash charge to operations for non-employee options with vesting is revalued at the end of each reporting period based upon the change in the fair value of the options and amortized to consulting expense over the related contract service period. For purposes of valuing stock options granted to our employees, non-employees and directors and officers through the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model.We did not grant options during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and we granted options to purchase an aggregate of 100,984 shares of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. To determine the risk-free interest rate, we utilized the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant with a term consistent with the expected term of our awards.The expected term of the options granted is in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletins 107 and 110, which is based on the average between vesting terms and contractual terms.The expected dividend yield reflects our current and expected future policy for dividends on our common stock.The expected stock price volatility for our stock options was calculated by examining the pro rata historical volatilities for similar publicly traded industry peers and the trading history for our common stock.We will continue to analyze the expected stock price volatility and expected term assumptions.We have not experienced any material forfeitures of stock options and, as such, have not established a forfeiture rate since the stock options currently outstanding are primarily held by our senior management and directors.We will continue to evaluate the effects of such future potential forfeitures, as they may arise, to evaluate our estimated forfeiture rate. 34 Research and Development Costs Our expenses include all R&D costs as incurred, of which such expenses include costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials, regulatory consulting and filing fees, testing, validation and production of RI-002 prior to regulatory approval and the disposition of plasma and equipment for which there is no alternative future use. Revenue Recognition Depending on the agreement with the customer, productrevenues from the sale of human plasma collected by ADMA BioCentersare recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which usually occurs at the time of shipment.Productrevenuesare recognized at the time of delivery if we retain the risk of loss during shipment.Our productrevenues are substantially attributable totwo customers. One customer accounts for greater than eightypercent and another customer accounts for greater than ten percent of our product revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement with Biotest AG have been completed.During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded deferred revenue of $1.5 million in accordance with the Biotest AG license agreement for the payment we received from Biotest after our BLA was filed with the FDA.Deferred revenue of $1.7 million was recorded in 2013 as a result of certain research and development services provided in accordance with the Biotest AG license agreement.Deferred revenue is recognized over the term of the license.Deferred revenue is amortized into income for a period of approximately 20 years, the term of the Biotest AG license agreement. Accounting for Loan and Security Agreement On June 19, 2015, we entered into aLSA with Oxford for up to $21.0 million and refinanced our then existing debt.The first tranche of $16.0 million from the Oxford loan was primarily used to repay our existing debt and the remaining $5.0 million is available at our option upon RI-002's BLA being approved from the FDA no later than January 31, 2017, which funding would also extend our interest only period for an additional six months pursuant to the May 2016 amendment to the LSA.The LSA bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.80% and (ii) the sum of (a) the three (3) month U.S. LIBOR rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal) on the date occurring on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 7.54% on the outstanding principal balance.We are obligated to begin to repay the principal over 36 months beginning February 1, 2017, unless accelerated as a result of certain events of default. A final payment equal to 8.95% of the funded loan amount is due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment.In the event of the six-month interest only extension, the final payment will be 9.95% of the funded loan, which shall also be due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. In the event we prepayany of the term loans for any reason, we are obligated to pay a prepayment charge corresponding to a percentage of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid, with such percentage being: 3.0% if prepayment occurs through thefirst anniversary of itsfunding, 2.0% if prepayment occurs after the first anniversarythrough the second anniversary of the applicable funding date, and1.0% if prepayment occurs after the second anniversary ofits funding date and prior to itsmaturity date. All term loans mature no later than January 1, 2020. The loans are secured by our assets, except for our intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge).The LSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including limitations on incurring indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions and making investments, distributions or transfers. 35 In connection with the LSA, on June 19, 2015, we issued to Oxford a seven-year warrant, expiring on June 19, 2022, to purchase 74,309 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $8.51 per share.We recorded $367,700 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan.The key assumptions used to value the warrants included, volatility of 57% on our common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of our common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 1.99% and a term of seven years.As a result of prepaying our prior loan before maturity, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million comprised of debt issuance costs, debt discount related to the warrants issued to our prior lender, along with a prepayment penalty. In May 2016, we entered into an amendment to our LSA with Oxford,pursuant to whichwe borrowed an additional $4.0 million, as an extension to theoriginal LSA entered into on June 19, 2015, which brings the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million. In connection therewith, weissued warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to24,800shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to $6.37, which will expire seven years after their issuance on May 13, 2023.We paid a total facility fee of $125,000, consisting of $105,000 previously paid and an additional $20,000 paid on the date the $4.0 million loan was funded. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have entered into leases for our ADMA BioCenters' facilities in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia.The Norcross, Georgia lease expires on September 30, 2023, and the Marietta, Georgia lease expires on January 31, 2024.There is a total minimum rent due under these leases of $2.7 million through the end of the lease terms.Item 1.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016 1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS ADMA Biologics, Inc. ("ADMA" or the "Company") is a late stage biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and intends to commercialize specialty plasma-based biologics for the proposed treatment of immune deficiencies and prevention of certain infectious diseases. The Company's targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disease or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. Our product candidates are intended to be used by physician specialists focused on caring for immune-compromised patients with or at risk for certain infectious diseases. ADMA also operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA Bio Centers Georgia, Inc. ("ADMA BioCenters"), a source plasma collection business with U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approved facilities in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia. Each facility holds certifications from the German Health Authority ("GHA") and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety ("MFDS"). ADMA BioCenters supplies ADMA with a portion of its raw material plasma for the manufacture of RI-002, ADMA's lead product candidate, which the Company is currently developing for the treatment of Primary Immune Deficiency Disease ("PIDD"). A Biologics License Application ("BLA") for RI-002 was submitted to the FDA and accepted for review during the third quarter of 2015. In July 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter ("CRL") to the Company for its BLA for RI-002. The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety and efficacy data for RI-002, nor did the FDA request any additional clinical studies be completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002. The FDA identified in the CRL, among other things, certain outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies at ADMA's third-party contract manufacturers and vendors and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues. The FDA indicated in the CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things, these deficiencies are resolved. Since receiving the CRL, the Company has worked diligently with its contract fill and finisher as well as the contract testing laboratory. The Company has also continued to work with its third-party contract manufacturer, Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("BPC " or "Seller"), and on January 21, 2017, the Company signed a definitive acquisition agreement to acquire certain manufacturing and therapy-related assets from Biotest in Boca Raton, Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biotest Aktiengesellschaft ("Biotest"), in efforts to address the CRL and remediate the outstanding warning letter at the manufacturing facility. The acquisition of certain manufacturing and therapy-related assets of Biotest (the "Proposed Acquisition") is anticipated to close in June 2017. The Company and its vendors are awaiting certain feedback from the agency on submissions already made and the Company intends to provide a timeline for resubmission of the BLA for RI-002 as soon as practicable. In May 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million, and subsequently borrowed an additional $4.0 million under its Loan and Security Agreement ("LSA") with Oxford Finance LLC ("Oxford"), which brought the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million (See Footnote 3). As of March 31, 2017, the Company had working capital of $2.7 million, consisting primarily of $8.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $0.3 million of short-term investments, $0.8 million of accounts receivable, $5.3 million of inventories, and $0.7 million of prepaid expenses, offset primarily by the current portion of note payable due to Oxford of $6.7 million, $3.9 million of accounts payable, $2.2 million of accrued expenses and $0.1 million of deferred revenue. Based upon the Company's projected revenue and expenditures for 2017, including the fees associated with the Proposed Acquisition of certain BPC assets, regulatory and consulting fees for RI-002 associated with third-party manufacturers and ongoing discussions with the FDA, continuing implementation of the Company's commercialization and expansion activities and certain other assumptions, management currently believes that its cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, projected revenue and accounts receivable are sufficient to fund ADMA's operations, as currently conducted, into the second half of 2017. These estimates may change based upon the timing of the closing of the Proposed Acquisition of certain BPC assets, whether or when the FDA approves RI-002, the timing of any required commercial manufacturing scale up activities or if any other assumptions of the Company change. This timing may also change based upon the timing of the completion of the Proposed Acquisition, anticipated in June 2017. Upon the closing of the Proposed Acquisition, BPC will be providing funds to ADMA consisting of: $12.5 million in funding, $15.0 million in debt financing and an additional $12.5 million commitment towards a future equity financing is expected to be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of 2018. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully close on the Proposed Acquisition. Other than the funding to be provided by BPC, the Company does not currently have arrangements to obtain additional financing. Furthermore, if the Company's assumptions underlying its estimated expenses and revenues are incorrect, it may have to raise additional capital sooner than anticipated. Due to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research and development and potential future commercialization of its product candidate, the Company is unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with its development activities. The Company's current estimates may be subject to change as circumstances regarding its business requirements evolve. The Company may decide to raise capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings, or obtain a bank credit facility or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. The Company does not have any existing commitments for future external funding. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if convertible, could result in dilution to the Company's stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict the Company's operations or other financing alternatives. Additional equity or debt financing, grants, or corporate collaboration and potential licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate the Company's research and development programs, reduce the Company's planned clinical trials and delay or abandon potential commercialization efforts of the Company's lead or other product candidates. The Company has reported losses since inception in June 2004 through March 31, 2017 of $113.5 million. Management believes that the Company will continue to incur net losses and negative net cash flows from operating activities to fund its research and development, commercial programs and meet its obligations on a timely basis through the foreseeable future. As such, these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts and the classification of liabilities that might be necessary from the outcome of this uncertainty. 5 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016 ADMA's long-term liquidity will be dependent upon on its ability to raise additional capital, to fund its research and development and commercial programs and meet its obligations on a timely basis. If ADMA is unable to successfully raise sufficient additional capital, it will likely not have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund its business operations, forcing ADMA to curtail activities and potentially significantly reduce, or potentially cease, operations. Even if ADMA is able to raise additional capital, such financings may only be available on unattractive terms, resulting in significant dilution of stockholders' interests and, in such event, the value and potential future market price of its common stock may decline. There can be no assurance that the Company's research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable. The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, dependence on collaborative arrangements, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with FDA and other governmental regulations and approval requirements. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADMA and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, ADMA Plasma Biologics, Inc. and ADMA BioCenters. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) which in the opinion of management are necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of March 31, 2017 and their results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, changes in stockholders' deficiency for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim periods or for the full year. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2016 on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 24, 2017. The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016, was derived from the 2016 audited consolidated financial statements. 6 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016 The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim reporting. Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in complete annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted. Inventories Plasma inventories (both plasma intended for resale and plasma intended for internal use in the Company's research and development and future anticipated commercialization activities of which certain quantities are labeled as normal source and Respiratory Syncytial Virus ("RSV"), high titer) are carried at the lower of cost or market value determined by the first-in, first-out method. Research and development plasma used in clinical trials was processed to a finished product and subsequently expensed to research and development. Inventory at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 consists of high titer RSV plasma and normal source plasma. Revenue recognition Depending on the agreement with the customer, product revenues from the sale of human plasma collected at the Company's plasma collection centers are recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which occurs at the time of shipment. Product revenues are recognized at the time of delivery if the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, two of the Company's customers, SK Plasma Co., Ltd. ("SK") and BPC, represented 98% of the Company's total revenues, with BPC representing approximately 81% of the Company's total revenues and SK representing approximately 17% of the Company's total revenues. Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement have been completed. Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are comprised of product revenues from the sale of normal source human plasma collected from the Company's plasma collection centers segment and license and other revenues are primarily attributable to the out-licensing of RI-002 to Biotest to market and sell in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East. Biotest and BPC, a subsidiary of Biotest, have provided the Company with certain services and financial payments in accordance with the related Biotest license agreement and is obligated to pay the Company certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are achieved. Deferred revenue is recognized over the term of the Biotest license. Deferred revenue is amortized into income for a period of approximately 20 years, the term of the Biotest license agreement. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include valuation of inventory, assumptions used in the fair value determination of stock-based compensation, warrants and the allowance for the valuation of future tax benefits. Loss per common share Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. 7 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016 Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, if any, by the weighted average number of common stock and dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. Potential common stock includes the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method). Potential common stock in the diluted net loss per share computation is excluded to the extent that it would be anti-dilutive. No potentially dilutive securities are included in the computation of any diluted per share amounts as the Company reported a net loss for all periods presented. The aggregate number of potentially dilutive securities upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options was 1.9 million and 1.8 million as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Stock-based compensation The Company follows recognized accounting guidance which requires all stock-based payments, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense, based on their fair values on the grant date. The estimated fair value of stock options granted under the Company's 2007 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "2007 Plan") and the Company's 2014 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2014 Plan") is recognized as compensation expense over the option-vesting period. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company granted stock options to purchase 182,000 and 85,984 shares of common stock, respectively, to its directors and employees. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The standard introduces a screen for determining when assets acquired are not a business and clarifies that a business must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that contribute to an output to be considered a business. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB, issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718), which provides for simplification of certain aspects of employee share-based payment accounting including income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2017. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on their balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires modified retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the standard may have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 , Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which includes amendments that require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 8 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016 In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments , which includes amendments that require an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the changes to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company adopted this standard and evaluated the impact the standard may have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . The standard requires entities to measure most inventory "at the lower of cost and net realizable value," thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures, one of which is net realizable value). The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2017. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable). Further, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is "substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern." The FASB believes that requiring management to perform the assessment will enhance the timeliness, clarity, and consistency of related disclosures and improve convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") (which emphasize management's responsibility for performing the going-concern assessment). However, the time horizon for the assessment (look-forward period) and the disclosure thresholds under GAAP and IFRSs will continue to differ. The Company adopted this standard as of December 31, 2016 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2017. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires that an entity recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to its customers. In order to achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This update will replace existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP, when it becomes effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. The updated standard will permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 9 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (Unaudited) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016 3. DEBT Loan and Security Agreement On June 19, 2015, the Company entered into an LSA with Oxford for up to $21.0 million of debt financing in two term loan tranches. The first term loan tranche of $16.0 million from the LSA (the "Term A Loan") was primarily used to repay the Company's previous debt facility with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. dated December 2012. The outstanding term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.80% and (ii) the sum of (a) the three-month U.S. LIBOR rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal ) on the date occurring on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 7.54% on the outstanding principal balance. The effective interest rate for the loan tranche of $16.0 million, including backend fees is 11.40%. The Company began repaying the principal balance on February 1, 2017 for a period of 36 months, unless accelerated as a result of certain events of default. A final payment equal to 8.95% of the funded loan amount is due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. All term loans mature no later than January 1, 2020. The loans are secured by the Company's assets, except for its intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). The LSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including limitations on incurring indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions and making investments, distributions or transfers. In connection with the entry into the LSA, on June 19, 2015, the Company issued to Oxford a seven-year warrant, expiring on June 19, 2022, to purchase 74,309 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $8.51 per share. The Company recorded $367,700 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan. The key assumptions used to value the warrants included: (i) volatility of 57% on the Company's common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of the Company' common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison; (ii) an expected dividend yield of 0.0%; (iii) a risk-free interest rate of 1.99%; and (iv) a term of seven years. In May 2016, the Company amended the LSA with Oxford (the "Amended LSA") which provided ADMA with an additional $4.0 million term loan (the "Term B Loan"), the availability of which was conditioned on completing an equity financing of its common stock of at least $10.0 million in gross proceeds no later than May 31, 2016. On May 3, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million and subsequently borrowed the additional $4.0 million from Oxford under the Amended LSA, which brings the total principal amount borrowed to $20.0 million. The effective interest rate for the loan tranche of $4.0 million, including backend fees is 13.04%. In the event the Company prepays a term loan for any reason, the Company is obligated to pay a prepayment charge corresponding to a percentage of the principal amount of the applicable term loan prepaid. The Amended LSA further modified the fees payable by the Company on mandatory or voluntary prepayment of a term loan prior to its maturity date as follows: (i) for a prepayment made on or after the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the first anniversary of its funding date, an amount equal to 3.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid; (ii) for a prepayment made after the first anniversary of the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the second anniversary of such funding date, an amount equal to 2.00% of the principal amount of such term loan prepaid; and (iii) for a prepayment of a term loan made after the second anniversary of its funding date and prior to its maturity date, an amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid. Pursuant to the Amended LSA, (i) the Company paid a total facility fee of $125,000, consisting of $105,000 previously paid and an additional $20,000 paid on the date the Term B Loan was funded; (ii) certain adjustments were made to the time periods for any applicable prepayment fees; and (iii) certain defined terms were adjusted, including a new February 1, 2017 amortization date. The Amended LSA further provides for customary representations, warranties and covenants for the Company. Except as otherwise amended, the Amended LSA does not alter the terms of the LSA. 10 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016 In connection with the Amended LSA, on May 13, 2016, the Company issued to Oxford a seven-year warrant, expiring on May 13, 2023, to purchase 24,800 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.37 per share, equal to 3.95% of the amount drawn of such tranche, divided by the average reported closing price per share of common stock for the consecutive 10 trading days prior to the applicable draw in accordance with the Company's drawdown of the Term B Loan. The Company recorded $86,300 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan. The key assumptions used to value the warrants included: volatility of 53.5% on the Company's common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of the Company's common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 1.51% and a term of seven years. A summary of the Oxford loan balance is as follows: 4. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY On May 3, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 2,176,154 shares of its common stock, for gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $13.0 million, after payment of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million. The shares were sold under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200638) that was declared effective by the SEC on December 23, 2014. Oxford Debt Financing Warrant Issuance In May 2016, the Company issued to Oxford warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 24,800 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal to $6.37 per share. The warrants became exercisable on May 13, 2016 for cash or by net exercise and will expire seven years after their issuance on May 13, 2023. Equity incentive plan The fair value of employee options granted was determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. The Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Because there has been minimal data for the Company's stock and very little historical experience with the Company's stock options, similar public companies and a pro rata percentage of the Company's common stock were used for calculating ADMA's volatility for comparison and expectations as to the assumptions required for fair value computation using the Black-Scholes methodology. 11 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016 The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options outstanding and expected to vest at March 31, 2017 is 6.5 years. The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options exercisable at March 31, 2017 is 5.6 years. A summary of the Company's option activity under the 2007 Plan and 2014 Plan and related information is as follows: Stock-based compensation expense for the three ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: As of March 31, 2017, the total compensation expense related to unvested options not yet recognized totaled $1,832,351. The weighted average vesting period over which the total compensation expense will be recorded related to unvested options not yet recognized at March 31, 2017 was approximately 2.3 years. 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company leases an office building and equipment from Areth, LLC ("Areth") pursuant to a shared services agreement on a month-to-month basis of which terms were amended by the Company's Board of Directors in June 2016. Rent expense amounted to $48,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $24,112 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Areth is a company controlled by Dr. Jerrold B. Grossman, the Company's Vice Chairman, and Adam S. Grossman, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, and the Company pays Areth monthly fees for the use of such office space and for other information technology, general warehousing and administrative services. The Company also reimburses its landlord for office and building related (common area) expenses, equipment and certain other operational expenses, which have been insignificant to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company maintains deposits and other accounts at Pascack Bankcorp, a bank of which Dr. Grossman served as a director through January 2016, and which was approximately 5%-owned by members of the Grossman family. Pascack Bankcorp was acquired by Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. in January 2016 and Dr. Grossman is currently a member of the Corporate Advisory Council of Lakeland Bancorp Inc. 12 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC.

This discussion, which refers to our historical results, should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this quarterly report, including "Risk Factors" and the consolidated financial statements and other consolidated financial information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The various sections of this discussion contain a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Our actual results may differ materially. Overview We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and intends to commercialize specialty plasma-based biologics for the proposed treatment of immune deficiencies and prevention of certain infectious diseases. Our targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disorder or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. Our product candidates are intended to be used by physician specialists focused on caring for immune-compromised patients with or at risk for certain infectious diseases. Our Lead Product Candidate RI-002 We are currently developing our lead product candidate, RI-002, for the treatment of PIDD, and have completed a pivotal Phase III clinical study. RI-002 is derived from human plasma blended from normal donors and donors tested to have high levels of neutralizing titers to RSV. RI-002 is manufactured using a process called fractionation, which purifies immune globulins, or IgG, from this blended plasma pool resulting in a final Intravenous Immune Globulin, or IVIG, product enriched with naturally occurring polyclonal anti-pathogen antibodies (e.g., streptococcus pneumonia, H. influenza type B, Cytomegalovirus or CMV, measles, tetanus, etc.). We use our proprietary RSV microneutralization assay to test for standardized levels of neutralizing antibodies to RSV in the final drug product. In the third quarter of 2015, the FDA accepted for review our BLA for RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD. In July 2016, the FDA issued a CRL. The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety or efficacy data for RI-002 submitted in the BLA, nor did the FDA request any additional clinical studies be completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002. The FDA identified in the CRL, among other things, certain outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies relating to Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC, at our third-party contract manufacturers and vendors and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues. The FDA indicated in the CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things, these deficiencies are resolved. Since receiving the CRL, we have worked diligently with our contract fill and finisher as well as the contract testing laboratory. We have also continued to work with our third-party contract manufacturer, BPC, or Seller, and on January 23, 2017 we announced the signing of a definitive acquisition agreement to acquire certain manufacturing and therapy-related assets from BPC in Boca Raton, Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biotest Aktiengesellschaft, or Biotest, in efforts to address the CRL and remediate the outstanding warning letter and other matters at the manufacturing facility. We continue to collaborate with our third-party manufacturers and vendors to identify solutions to outstanding issues identified in the CRL. We are currently preparing documentation for an additional submission to the FDA to address the CRL. We, along with our vendors, are awaiting certain feedback from the FDA regarding previous submissions and we intend to provide a timeline for resubmission of our BLA for RI-002 as soon as practicable. If RI-002 is approved by the FDA for PIDD, we intend to commercialize RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD and explore alternative processes to evaluate and seek approval for RI-002 for additional indications, patient populations and uses. Evaluation of PIDD Patients PIDD, a genetic disorder that causes a deficient or absent immune system, is caused by hereditary or genetic defects and can affect anyone regardless of age or gender. PIDD patients are more vulnerable to infections and more likely to suffer complications from these infections. IVIG is a plasma derived product that is used to prevent serious infections in patients with PIDD. It is comprised of polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins produced by B-cells that are used by the body's immune system to neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses. It is estimated that there are about 250,000 diagnosed PIDD patients in the U.S., approximately half of whom are treated with IVIG regularly. In the U.S., sales of immune globulin products for all its uses were reported to be approximately $4.8 billion in 2014. 16 The RI-002 pivotal Phase III clinical trial was conducted as a single arm study in which patients were treated approximately once per month for a period of 12 months plus 90 days for follow up. Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in nine treatment centers in the U.S. The pivotal Phase III primary endpoint followed published FDA industry guidance, which provides for a reduction in the incidence of serious infections to less than one per year in each subject receiving IVIG. The secondary outcome was safety and included other pharmacokinetic, or PK, data collection points including antibody titers for certain agents, including RSV antibody levels at various time points after infusion. RI-002 demonstrated positive results in the Phase III study in patients with PIDD, meeting its primary endpoint, of no Serious Bacterial Infections, or SBI, reported. RI-002 was administered a total of 793 infusions with zero serious adverse events to 59 patients in nine treatment centers throughout the U.S. These results, included in the BLA, more than meet the requirement specified by FDA guidance of 1 SBI per patient-year. On February 22, 2015, at the 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology Annual Meeting, scientific investigators reported on the secondary outcomes that included: a total of 93 days, or 1.66 days per patient per year lost from work or school due to infection; one hospitalization due to an infection of only five days duration in the entire study and IgG trough levels above those required by the FDA for IVIG products. Additionally, there was a marked increase in all of the measured specific anti-pathogen antibodies in PK subjects (n=31). The mean of maximum fold increases in specific antibody levels after infusion of RI-002 ranged from 1.9 fold (S. pneumonia type 19A) to 5.3 fold (RSV), which were statistically significant fold increases from the pathogen's specific measured baselines. The safety profile of RI-002 is comparable to that of other immunoglobulins. Rationale for the Potential Evaluation in RSV Infected Patients RSV is a common virus that ordinarily leads to mild, cold-like symptoms in healthy adults and children. In high-risk groups, such as the PIDD population and the other immune-compromised populations, RSV can lead to a more serious infection and may even cause death. The polyclonal antibodies which are present in RI-002 are expected to prevent infections in immune-compromised patients. We previously conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to evaluate RI-001, RI-002's predecessor product candidate, in immune-compromised, RSV-infected patients. This trial was conducted with 21 patients in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Phase II dose-ranging trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline RSV titers to day 18 in the high dose and low dose treatment groups when compared with placebo (p=0.0043 and p=0.0268, respectively). The mean fold increase for high dose was 9.24 (95% CI 4.07, 21.02) and the observed mean fold increase for low dose was 4.85 (95% CI 2.22, 10.59). The mean fold change for placebo treated patients was 1.42 (95% CI 0.64, 3.17). In addition, more patients in the high dose (85.7%) and low dose (42.9%) groups experienced greater than a four-fold increase from baseline to day 18 in RSV titer levels compared to placebo (0%). There were no serious drug-related adverse events reported during the trial. From April 2009 through February 2011, RI-001 was also administered to 15 compassionate use patients where physicians requested access to the product for treating their patients with documented lower respiratory tract RSV infections due to the fact that these patients had failed conventional therapeutic interventions. Serum samples were obtained from 13 patients. Samples showed that patients demonstrated a four-fold or greater rise in RSV antibody titers from baseline. Serum samples were not obtained from two patients that received Palivizumab. All 11 patients who received RI-001 within 4.2 days after the onset of the diagnosis of RSV survived. The drug was well-tolerated in all 15 patients and there were no reports of serious adverse events attributable to RI-001. Data from our Phase II clinical trial, compassionate use experience and data obtained from the evaluation of RI-002 in the infected cotton rat animal model has been presented at various conferences during 2014, 2015 and 2016. 17 Based on these results, we intend to evaluate RI-002 for the treatment of RSV patients following FDA approval, if received, for treatment of PIDD. Commercialization While we are working towards remediating the warning letter and other deficiencies and eventually refiling the BLA resubmission for RI-002, we expect to continue our commercialization efforts and plan to increase our initiatives by hiring a small, specialty sales force to market Nabi-HB (Hepatitis B Immune Globulin, Human) upon closing the Proposed Acquisition anticipated in June 2017, and Bivigam (Immune Globulin Intravenous, Human) upon its relaunch and RI-002 once approved by the FDA, to hospitals, physician offices/clinics, and other specialty treatment organizations. We anticipate staffing our company with additional personnel for patient support, medical affairs, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, scientific affairs, reimbursement, inventory and logistics, human resources, and financial and operational management. If and when we receive FDA approval, we may also use a network of national distributors to assist with order fulfillment for RI-002 for use by healthcare professionals and hospitals. Intellectual Property During the second quarter of 2015, we received a notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent Office, or USPTO, for our RI-002 patent filed under U.S. patent application 14/592,721 entitled 'Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Immunodeficiency,' which extends through January 2035. During the third quarter of 2015, our U.S. Patent 9,107,906 was issued by the USPTO. This patent describes methods by which the blending of plasma obtained from normal donors with plasma obtained from donors selected to have high levels of neutralizing titers to RSV form a unique antibody enriched plasma pool and provide for the standardization of the levels of anti-RSV antibodies in the RI-002 final product. Our proprietary microneutralization assay allows us to effectively identify and isolate donor plasma with high-titer RSV antibodies and to standardize RI-002's antibody profile, which we believe may enable us to garner a premium price. Plasma Collection Facilities Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA Bio Centers Georgia, Inc., or ADMA BioCenters, operates two FDA-licensed, German Health Authority, or GHA, and Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MFDS, certified source plasma collection facilities located in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia, which provide us with a portion of our blood plasma for the manufacture of RI-002. A typical plasma collection center, such as those operated by ADMA BioCenters, can collect approximately 30,000 to 50,000 liters of source plasma annually, which may be sold for different prices depending upon the type of plasma, quantity of purchase, and market conditions at the time of sale. Plasma collected from ADMA BioCenters' two Georgia facilities that is not used for making RI-002 is sold to third-party customers in the U.S., and other locations where we are approved globally under supply agreements or in the open &quot;spot&quot; market. We have entered into long-term manufacturing and licensing agreements with Biotest and their U.S. subsidiary, BPC, that provide for the exclusive manufacture of RI-002. At the same time, we granted Biotest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to market and sell RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in Europe and in other selected territories in North Africa and the Middle East. Financial Operations Overview Revenues Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are comprised of product revenues from the sale of normal source human plasma collected from our plasma collection centers segment and license and other revenues which are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized into income over the terms of the respective agreements. In exchange for the out-licensing of RI-002 to market and sell in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East, BPC has provided us with certain services and a financial payment received in accordance with the related license agreement and is obligated to pay us certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are achieved. 18 A significant amount of our revenues are attributed to a single customer, BPC. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, two of our customers, SK Plasma Co., Ltd., or SK, and BPC, represented 98% of our total revenues, with BPC representing approximately 81% of our total revenues and SK representing approximately 17% of our total revenues. Product revenues from the sale of human plasma collected at our FDA-licensed plasma collection centers are recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which occurs, depending on the agreement with the customer, at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery if we retain the risk of loss during shipment. Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement have been completed. Research and Development Expenses Research and development, or R&amp;D, expenses, attributable to our R&amp;D segment, consists of clinical research organization costs, clinical trial costs related to our clinical trial, consulting expenses relating to regulatory and medical affairs, quality assurance and control, manufacturing, assay development, ongoing testing costs, drug product manufacturing including the cost of plasma, plasma storage and transportation costs, as well as wages and benefits for employees, including stock-based compensation directly related to the R&amp;D of RI-002. All R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred. The process of conducting preclinical studies, clinical trials and regulatory activities necessary to obtain FDA approval is costly and time consuming. The probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the quality of the product candidate's early clinical data, investment in the program, competition, regulatory, manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, the uncertainties associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, R&amp;D expenses decreased as compared to R&amp;D expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016 due to lower validation, testing and production costs related to RI-002. We anticipate that 2017 R&amp;D expenses will continue to decrease, as compared to 2016, as a result of reduced testing and validation services related to RI-002 offset by increased costs related to regulatory activities in connection with the CRL. Once we have clarity for the timing of our expected BLA resubmission and anticipated RI-002 approval, we would then expect our R&amp;D costs to increase. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative, or G&amp;A, expenses, consist of Proposed Acquisition fees, wages, stock-based compensation, benefits for senior management and staff unrelated to R&amp;D, legal fees, accounting and auditing fees, commercialization and marketing activities, information technology, investor relations fees, rent, maintenance and utilities, insurance, travel and other expenses related to the general operations of our business. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, G&amp;A expenses primarily increased as a result of fees incurred for the Proposed Acquisition, fees paid for legal, accounting, and financial advisory fees related to the issuance of a fairness opinion and due diligence fees. We expect that our G&amp;A expenses will decrease as we continue to manage our costs through deferring certain pre-launch and commercial planning activities, while we focus on addressing the CRL. Once we have clarity for the timing of our expected BLA resubmission and anticipated RI-002 approval, we would then expect our G&amp;A costs to increase. Other Income and Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest expense consists of interest incurred on our notes payable, as well as the amortization of end of term fees, back end fees, value of warrants issued, facility and financing fees. We anticipate other income and expense to remain consistent throughout 2017 as a result of our current outstanding debt and interest earned on investments. 19 Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Summary table The following table presents a summary of the changes in our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016: Revenues We recorded total revenues of $2,628,871 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $2,123,886 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Product revenue was $2,593,163 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which is attributable to our ADMA BioCenters plasma collection centers segment and derived from the sale of human source plasma collected in our FDA-licensed, GHA and MFDS-certified Georgia-based blood plasma collection centers, compared to product revenue of $2,088,178 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in product revenue of $504,985 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to increased sales generated from our plasma supply agreement with SK, under which SK purchases normal source plasma from ADMA BioCenters. The normal source plasma and high-titer RSV plasma which we did not sell was allocated to inventory in anticipation of commercial manufacturing. For each of the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, license and other revenue was $35,708, which relates to services and financial payments provided by BPC and Biotest in accordance with our license agreement. We have not generated any revenue from our therapeutics research and development business. Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue was $1,616,287 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and $1,266,421 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in cost of product revenue of $349,866 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was directly related to the increase in product revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Research and Development Expenses R&amp;D expenses, which are attributable to our R&amp;D segment, were $1,192,727 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $834,985 as compared to $2,027,712 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. R&amp;D expenses consist of clinical research organization costs, consulting expenses relating to regulatory affairs, quality control and manufacturing, assay development and ongoing testing costs, clinical trial costs and fees, drug product manufacturing, including the cost of plasma, plasma storage and transportation costs, as well as wages and benefits for staff directly related to the research and development of RI-002. R&amp;D expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily as a result of lower validation, testing and production costs related to RI-002 due to receipt of the CRL from the FDA during the third quarter of 2016. 20 Plasma Center Operating Expenses Plasma center operating expenses were $1,479,476 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $199,057 as compared to $1,280,419 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Plasma center operating expenses consist of: general and administrative plasma center costs; overhead comprised of rent, maintenance, utilities, wages, stock-based compensation and benefits for center staff, plasma collection supplies, plasma transportation and storage (off-site); advertising and promotion expenses; and computer software fees related to donor collections. The increase in plasma center expenses is attributable to hiring additional staff and increasing the hours of operations at our Marietta, Georgia location during the first quarter of 2017. We expect that as plasma collection increases, our operating expenses will also increase accordingly. General and Administrative Expenses G&amp;A expenses were $4,277,384 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $2,569,514 from $1,707,870 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. G&amp;A expenses consist of Proposed Acquisition fees, wages and stock-based compensation for our senior management and staff unrelated to research and development, professional fees for commercialization and marketing consulting, attorneys, accountants and auditors, investor relations, maintenance and utilities, insurance, information technology, travel and other expenses related to the general operations of the business. G&amp;A expenses primarily increased as a result of fees incurred for the Proposed Acquisition, fees paid for legal, accounting, financial advisory fees related to the issuance of a fairness opinion and due diligence fees. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were $8,565,874 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $2,283,452 from $6,282,422 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in G&amp;A expenses. Other Income (Expense); Interest Expense Other expense, net, was $599,960 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $453,933 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase of $146,027 is primarily related to increased interest expense due to an increase of $4,000,000 to our current debt in the second quarter of 2016, which includes debt discounts amortization for our new lender's end of term fees, back end fees, value of warrants issued, facility and financing fees. Net Loss Net loss was $6,536,963 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $1,924,494 from $4,612,469 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in G&amp;A expenses. Cash Flows Net Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $5,398,426 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The net loss for this period was higher than net cash used in operating activities by $1,138,537, which was primarily attributable to an increase in prepaid expenses of $432,932 for vendor payments related to insurance premiums, increased inventories of $288,346 related to collection and purchases of normal source and RSV plasma, an increase in accounts payable of $1,339,764 primarily related to legal, accounting and due diligence fees associated with the Proposed Acquisition, offset by decreases in accounts receivable of $178,089 and accrued expenses of $160,637. Net loss also included non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation of $235,877, amortization of debt discount of $190,253 and depreciation and amortization of $118,062. 21 Net cash used in operating activities was $5,167,930 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The net loss for this period was lower than net cash used in operating activities by $555,461, which was primarily attributable to an increase in prepaid expenses of $633,883 for vendor payments related to insurance premiums, prepayments to third party manufacturing vendors for commercial manufacturing of RI-002, increased inventories of $603,466 related to allocating additional plasma to inventory in preparation for commercial manufacturing activities anticipated in 2016, an increase in accounts payable of $377,061 offset by a decrease in accrued expenses of $306,462. Net loss also included non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation of $422,180, and depreciation and amortization of $251,940. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $5,141,600 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which was related to the redemptions of short-term investments of $5,145,184 and $3,584 in purchases of computers and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities was $3,655,762 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, which was related to the maturity of short-term investments of $3,673,199 and $17,437 in purchases of computers and equipment. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,115,113 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which primarily consisted of repayments on the principal balance for our Loan and Security Agreement, or LSA, with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, which the Company became obligated to begin repaying over 36 months beginning February 1, 2017. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $3,659 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, for payments on our leasehold improvement loan for ADMA BioCenters. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview As of March 31, 2017, we had working capital of $2.7 million, consisting primarily of $8.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $0.3 million of short term investments, $0.8 million of accounts receivable, $5.3 million of inventories and $0.7 million of prepaid expenses, offset primarily by the current portion of the note payable due to Oxford of $6.7 million, $3.9 million of accounts payable, $2.2 million of accrued expenses and $0.1 million of deferred revenue. We have had limited revenue from operations and we have incurred cumulative losses of $113.5 million since inception. We have funded our operations to date primarily from equity investments, loans from venture debt lenders and loans from our primary stockholders. In May 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock and we received net proceeds of approximately $12.9 million. In May 2016, we amended our LSA with Oxford and borrowed an additional $4.0 million. In March 2015, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $10.2 million from an underwritten public offering from the sale of our common stock. Our funds are being used and have been used: to conduct clinical trials; to manufacture drug products; to collect and procure plasma; to test plasma donors for RSV titers; to file our BLA for RI-002; to conduct pre-launch activities; for commercialization and marketing activities; for the buildout and expansion of our plasma centers; for expenses related to our Proposed Acquisition of certain assets of BPC and the remainder for payment of existing accounts payable; for general and administrative, research and development expenses; and for other business activities and general corporate purposes. 22 Future Financing Needs We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on product development, quality and regulatory activities pre-launch and commercialization, procuring raw material plasma, manufacturing, conducting potential future clinical trials for our product candidates and purchasing clinical trial materials from our suppliers. We anticipate that, based upon our projected revenue and expenditures, our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable will be sufficient to fund our operations into the second half of 2017. In June 2017, we anticipate closing the Proposed Acquisition with BPC, at which time BPC will provide us with funds consisting of: $12.5 million in funding, $15.0 million in debt financing and an additional $12.5 million commitment towards a future equity financing, which funds are expected to be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of 2018. In order to have sufficient cash to fund our operations thereafter and to continue as a going concern, we will need to raise additional equity or debt capital by the end of the first quarter of 2018, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in doing so. Other than the funding to be provided by BPC upon closing the Proposed Acquisition, we currently do not have arrangements to obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully close the Proposed Acquisition. This time frame may change based upon the timing of our closing of the Proposed Acquisition, the quality management systems' remediation plans for the BPC operations, commercial manufacturing scale up activities, how aggressively we execute on our commercial initiatives and the resubmission of our BLA for RI-002 and when the FDA approves our BLA for RI-002, if at all. We currently do not have arrangements to obtain additional financing. Any such financing could be difficult to obtain or only available on unattractive terms and could result in significant dilution of stockholders' interests. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business plan and financial performance and we could be forced to delay, discontinue or prevent product development, clinical trial or commercialization activities, delay or discontinue the approval of any of our potential products, or potentially cease operations. In addition, we could be forced to reduce or forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities. Furthermore, if our assumptions underlying our estimated expenses are incorrect, we may have to raise additional capital sooner than anticipated. Because of numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research and development and potential future commercialization of our product candidate, we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our anticipated clinical trials and development activities. Our current estimates may be subject to change as circumstances regarding our business requirements evolve. We may decide to raise capital through public or private equity offerings, such financings may only be available on unattractive terms, resulting in significant dilution of stockholders' interests and, in such event, the value and potential future market price of our common stock may decline, or we may decide to obtain debt financings or a bank credit facility or to enter into corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if convertible, could result in dilution to our current stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations or other future financing alternatives. Additional equity or debt financing, grants, or corporate collaboration and potential licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our planned clinical trials and delay or abandon potential commercialization efforts of our lead product candidate or other product candidates. Our long-term liquidity depends on our ability to raise additional capital, to fund our research and development and commercial programs and meet our obligations on a timely basis. We have reported losses since inception in June 2004 through March 31, 2017, and we have as of March 31, 2017, an accumulated deficit of $113.5 million. We believe that we will continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities to fund our research and development, commercial programs and meet our obligations on a timely basis through the foreseeable future. As such, these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to successfully raise sufficient additional capital, we will likely not have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund our business operations as we currently operate, which may force us to delay, discontinue or prevent product development and clinical trial activities or the approval of any of our potential products, curtail our activities and potentially significantly reduce, or potentially cease operations. 23 Financial markets in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia continue to experience disruption, including, among other things, significant volatility in security prices, declining valuations of certain investments, as well as severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions continues to be greatly reduced and local governments and many businesses are still suffering from the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. Instability in the credit and financial market conditions may negatively impact our ability to access capital and credit markets and our ability to manage our cash balance. While we are unable to predict the continued duration and severity of the adverse conditions in the U.S. and other countries, any of the circumstances mentioned above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows or cash position. Effect of Inflation Inflation did not have a significant impact on our net sales, revenues or income from continuing operations in 2014, 2015 or 2016, or for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The standard introduces a screen for determining when assets acquired are not a business and clarifies that a business must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that contribute to an output to be considered a business. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718), which provides for simplification of certain aspects of employee share-based payment accounting including income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017 and will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition approach depending on the area covered in this update. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures during the first quarter of 2017. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on their balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires modified retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. We are currently evaluating the impact the standard may have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 , Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which includes amendments that require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 24 In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments , which includes amendments that require an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the changes to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. We adopted this standard and evaluated the impact the standard may have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . The standard requires entities to measure most inventory "at the lower of cost and net realizable value," thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures, one of which is net realizable value). The standard is effective for us prospectively beginning January 1, 2017. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements during the first quarter of 2017. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable). Further, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is "substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern." The FASB believes that requiring management to perform the assessment will enhance the timeliness, clarity, and consistency of related disclosures and improve convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS (which emphasize management's responsibility for performing the going-concern assessment). However, the time horizon for the assessment (look-forward period) and the disclosure thresholds under Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the U.S. of America, or GAAP, and IFRS will continue to differ. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard as of December 31, 2016 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements during the first quarter of 2017. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires that an entity recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to its customers. In order to achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This update will replace existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP, when it becomes effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. The updated standard will permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact of this update on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 25 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We could be an emerging growth company until December 31, 2018, which is the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a "large accelerated filer," our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. As an "emerging growth company," we may, under Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We may take advantage of this extended transition period until the first to occur of the date that we (i) are no longer an "emerging growth company" or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this extended transition period. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our condensed consolidated financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Until the date that we are no longer an "emerging growth company" or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B), upon issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to our condensed consolidated financial statements and that has a different effective date for public and private companies, we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for non-emerging growth companies and the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard. As an emerging growth company, we are also exempt from the requirement to have our independent auditors provide an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and assumptions, including those described below. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates. Some of the estimates and assumptions we have to make under GAAP require difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the estimation processes involved, the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period on a straight-line basis. We account for stock options granted to non-employees on a fair value basis using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. The noncash charge to operations for non-employee options with vesting is revalued at the end of each reporting period based upon the change in the fair value of the options and amortized to consulting expense over the related contract service period. For purposes of valuing stock options granted to our employees, non-employees and directors and officers through the three months ended March 31, 2017, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We granted options to purchase an aggregate of 182,000 shares of common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2017. To determine the risk-free interest rate, we utilized the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant with a term consistent with the expected term of our awards. The expected term of the options granted is in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletins 107 and 110, which is based on the average between vesting terms and contractual terms. The expected dividend yield reflects our current and expected future policy for dividends on our common stock. The expected stock price volatility for our stock options was calculated by examining the pro rata historical volatilities for similar publicly traded industry peers and the trading history for our common stock. We will continue to analyze the expected stock price volatility and expected term assumptions. 26 Research and Development Costs Our R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred, including costs associated with (i) planning and conducting clinical trials, (ii) drug product manufacturing, including the cost of plasma, plasma storage and transportation costs; (iii) quality testing, validation, regulatory consulting and filing fees; and (iv) employees' compensation expenses directly related to R&amp;D activities. Revenue Recognition Depending on the agreement with the customer, revenue from the sale of human plasma collected by ADMA BioCenters is recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which usually occurs at the time of shipment. Product revenue is recognized at the time of delivery if we retain the risk of loss during shipment. Our product revenues are substantially attributable to two customers. One customer accounts for greater than 80% and another customer accounts for greater than 15% of our product revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement with Biotest have been completed. Accounting for Loan and Security Agreement On June 19, 2015, we entered into a LSA with Oxford for up to $21.0 million and refinanced our then existing debt. The first tranche of $16.0 million from the Oxford loan was primarily used to repay our existing debt and the remaining $5.0 million was available at our option upon RI-002's BLA being approved from the FDA no later than January 31, 2017, which funding would have also extended our interest only period for an additional six months pursuant to the May 2016 amendment to the LSA. The LSA bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.80% and (ii) the sum of (a) the three month U.S. LIBOR rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal ) on the date occurring on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 7.54% on the outstanding principal balance. We began repaying the principal balance on February 1, 2017 for a period of 36 months, unless accelerated as a result of certain events of default. A final payment equal to 8.95% of the funded loan amount is due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. In the event of the six-month interest only extension, the final payment will be 9.95% of the funded loan, which shall also be due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. In the event we elect to prepay the loan, we are obligated to pay a prepayment charge corresponding to a percentage of the principal amount of the loan, with such percentage being: (i) for a prepayment made on or after the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the first anniversary of its funding date, an amount equal to 3.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid; (ii) for a prepayment made after the first anniversary of the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the second anniversary of such funding date, an amount equal to 2.00% of the principal amount of such term loan prepaid; and (iii) for a prepayment of a term loan made after the second anniversary of its funding date and prior to its maturity date, an amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid. All term loans mature no later than January 1, 2020. The loans are secured by our assets, except for our intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). The LSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including limitations on incurring indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions and making investments, distributions or transfers. In connection with the LSA, on June 19, 2015, we issued to Oxford a seven-year warrant, expiring on June 19, 2022, to purchase 74,309 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $8.51 per share. We recorded $367,700 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan. The key assumptions used to value the warrants included: (i) volatility of 57% on our common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of our common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison; (ii) an expected dividend yield of 0.0%; (iii) a risk-free interest rate of 1.99%; and (iv) a term of seven years. As a result of prepaying our prior loan before maturity, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million comprised of debt issuance costs, debt discount related to the warrants issued to our prior lender, and a prepayment penalty. 27 In May 2016, we entered into an amendment to our LSA with Oxford, pursuant to which we borrowed an additional $4.0 million, as an extension to the original LSA entered into on June 19, 2015, which brings the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million. In connection therewith, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 24,800 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to $6.37, which will expire seven years after their issuance on May 13, 2023. We paid a total facility fee of $125,000, consisting of $105,000 previously paid and an additional $20,000 paid on the date the $4.0 million loan was funded. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have entered into leases for our ADMA BioCenters' facilities in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia. The Norcross, Georgia lease expires on September 30, 2023, and the Marietta, Georgia lease expires on January 31, 2024. There is a total minimum rent due under these leases of $4.8 million through the end of the lease terms.Item 1. Financial Statements. ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS ADMA Biologics, Inc. ("ADMA" or the "Company") is a vertically integrated biopharmaceutical and specialty immunoglobulin company that develops, manufactures and markets specialty plasma-based biologics for the treatment of immune deficiencies and prevention of certain infectious diseases. The Company's targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disease or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. The Company's products and product candidates are intended to be used by physician specialists focused on caring for immune-compromised patients with or at risk for certain infectious diseases. ADMA operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries ADMA Plasma Biologics, Inc., ADMA BioManufacturing, LLC ("ADMA BioManufacturing") and ADMA Bio Centers Georgia, Inc. ("ADMA BioCenters"). ADMA BioManufacturing was formed in January 2017 to facilitate the acquisition of the Biotest Therapy Business Unit ("BTBU") of Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("BPC" and, together with Biotest AG, "Biotest") as more fully described below. ADMA BioCenters is the Company's source plasma collection business, with facilities located in Norcross, GA and Marietta, GA. Each ADMA BioCenters facility has approved licenses with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and certifications from the German Health Authority (the "GHA") and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. ADMA BioCenters supplies ADMA with a portion of its raw material plasma for the manufacture of RI-002, ADMA's lead product candidate, which the Company is currently developing for the treatment of Primary Immune Deficiency Disease ("PIDD"). As discussed in Note 3, on June 6, 2017, ADMA completed the acquisition of certain assets (the "Biotest Assets") of BTBU, which includes two FDA-licensed products, Nabi-HB (Hepatitis B Immune Globulin, Human) and Bivigam (Immune Globulin Intravenous, Human). These products are manufactured at the Company's plasma fractionation facility located in Boca Raton, Florida (the "Boca Facility") acquired in the transaction. The facility is FDA-licensed and certified by the GHA. Immediately following the acquisition, the Biotest Assets were contributed into ADMA BioManufacturing. In addition to Nabi-HB and Bivigam , BTBU also provides contract manufacturing for certain clients, including the sale of intermediate by-products. Nabi-HB is a hyperimmune globulin that is rich in antibodies to the hepatitis B virus. Nabi-HB is indicated for the treatment of acute exposure to blood containing hepatitis B surface antigen ("HBsAg"), prenatal exposure to infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, sexual exposure to HBs-Ag-positive persons and household exposure to persons with acute hepatitis B virus infection. Bivigam is an Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10% Liquid, indicated for the treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiency. FDA approval for Bivigam was received on December 19, 2012, and sales commenced in the first quarter of 2013. In November 2014, the FDA issued a warning letter to Biotest related to certain issues identified at the Boca Facility. In December 2016, Biotest temporarily suspended the commercial production of Bivigam in order to focus on the completion of planned improvements to the manufacturing process in response to the November 2014 warning letter issued by the FDA. Prior to the closing of the acquisition, BTBU was the Company's third-party manufacturer for RI-002. ADMA submitted a Biologics License Application for RI-002 (the "BLA") to the FDA which was accepted for review during the third quarter of 2015. In July 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (the "CRL") to the Company for the BLA. The CRL reaffirmed the issues set forth in the November 2014 warning letter, and also identified certain outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies at ADMA's third-party contract manufacturers and vendors and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues. The FDA indicated in the CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things, these deficiencies are resolved. The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety and efficacy data for RI-002, nor did the FDA request any additional clinical studies be completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002. ADMA's highest priority is to remediate the outstanding compliance issues identified at the Boca Facility in the previously issued FDA warning letter. Since receiving the CRL, the Company has worked diligently with its contract fill and finisher and contract testing laboratory, and the Company continues to address the CRL and remediate the outstanding warning letter at the Boca Facility. With the completion of the acquisition of the Biotest Assets, ADMA now has control over the drug substance manufacturing process and the Company anticipates that it will be in a position to refile the BLA for RI-002 in the middle of 2018. 5 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition of the Biotest Assets, the Company received a $15.0 million loan from Biotest evidenced by a 6% subordinated note payable to BPC with a maturity of 5 years (see Note 4), and BPC committed to participate in any future equity offering or private placement undertaken by the Company in an amount equal to $12.5 million. As of June 30, 2017, the Company had working capital of $28.6 million, including $25.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. Based upon the Company's current projected revenue and expenditures for 2017, including expected consulting fees for warning letter remediation, regulatory and consulting fees associated with RI-002 approval, continuing implementation of the Company's commercialization and expansion activities, as well as certain other assumptions, management currently believes that its cash, cash equivalents, projected revenue and accounts receivable, along with the additional equity commitment from Biotest, are sufficient to fund ADMA's operations, as currently conducted, into the first quarter of 2018. These estimates may change based upon results from the Company's remediation efforts, the timing of any required commercial manufacturing scale up activities, the various financing options ADMA is exploring, including the potential refinancing of its current senior debt which, if achieved on favorable terms, would be expected to allow ADMA to extend its current cash runway from the first quarter of 2018 well into the second half of 2018 and perhaps further, depending on the timing and structuring of the loan facility, or if any other assumptions of the Company change. The Company does not currently have any other firm commitments to obtain additional financing. Furthermore, if the Company's assumptions underlying its estimated expenses and revenues are incorrect, it may have to raise additional capital sooner than currently anticipated. Due to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with ongoing remediations, the research and development and potential future commercialization of its products and product candidates, the Company is unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with its development activities. The Company's current estimates may be subject to change as circumstances regarding its business requirements evolve. The Company may decide to raise capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings, or obtain a bank credit facility or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. The Company does not have any existing commitments for future external funding other than the additional equity commitment from Biotest. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if convertible, could result in dilution to the Company's stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict the Company's operations or other financing alternatives. Additional equity or debt financing, grants, or corporate collaboration and potential licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate the Company's research and development programs, reduce the Company's planned clinical trials and delay or abandon potential commercialization efforts of the Company's lead or other product candidates. The Company has reported losses since inception in June 2004 through June 30, 2017 of $122.5 million. Management believes that the Company will continue to incur net losses and negative net cash flows from operating activities to fund its research and development, commercial programs and meet its obligations on a timely basis through the foreseeable future. As such, these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts and the classification of liabilities that might be necessary from the outcome of this uncertainty. ADMA's long-term liquidity will be dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital, to fund its research and development and commercial programs and meet its obligations on a timely basis. If ADMA is unable to successfully raise sufficient additional capital, it will likely not have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund its business operations, forcing ADMA to curtail activities and potentially significantly reduce, or potentially cease, operations. Even if ADMA is able to raise additional capital, such financings may only be available on unattractive terms, resulting in significant dilution of stockholders' interests and, in such event, the value and potential future market price of its common stock may decline. 6 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS There can be no assurance that the Company's research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable. The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, dependence on collaborative arrangements, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with FDA and other governmental regulations and approval requirements. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") and Accounting Standards Updates ("ASU") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB"). The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 24, 2017. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X, and therefore omit or condense certain footnotes and other information normally included in consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments (which consist primarily of accruals, estimates and assumptions that impact the financial statements) considered necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position as of June 30, 2017 and its results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. Operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2017. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, valuation of inventory, assumptions used in the fair value determination of stock-based compensation, warrants, and the allowance for the valuation of future tax benefits. Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations . Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration are recorded at their acquisition date fair values. Any change in the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date, including changes from events after the acquisition date, will be recognized in the period of the estimated fair value change. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the business combination. Identifiable assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. 7 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fair value of financial instruments The carrying amounts of certain of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts payable, are shown at cost which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The debt outstanding under the loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance, LLC (see Note 4) approximates fair value due to variable interest rate. With respect to the related party note payable in the amount of $15.0 million as of June 30, 2017 (see Notes 3 and 4), which is held by a principal stockholder of the Company and was issued concurrent with an acquisition transaction with such stockholder, the Company has concluded that an estimation of fair value for this note is not practicable. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired by the Company. Goodwill at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $3.5 million and $0, respectively. All of the Company's goodwill is attributable to its ADMA BioManufacturing business segment. The following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the six months ended June 30, 2017: Goodwill is not amortized, but assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If the Company concludes that this is the case, then it must perform a two-step goodwill impairment process. The first step compares a reporting unit's fair value to its carrying amount to identify potential goodwill impairment. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, the second step of the impairment test must be completed to measure the amount of the reporting unit's goodwill impairment loss, if any. Step two compares the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its implied fair value, which is the fair value of the reporting unit less the fair value of the unit's assets and liabilities, including identifiable intangible assets. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 of each year. Impairment of long-lived assets The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If indicators of impairment exist, projected future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to its carrying amount to determine whether the asset's value is recoverable. Any resulting impairment is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset in excess of fair value and a charge to operating results. For the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company determined that there was no impairment of its long-lived assets. Revenue recognition Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017 are comprised of revenues from Nabi-HB, product revenues from the sale of normal source human plasma collected from the Company's plasma collection centers segment and license and other revenues are primarily attributable to the out-licensing of RI-002 to Biotest to market and sell in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East. Biotest has provided the Company with certain services and financial payments in accordance with the related Biotest license agreement and is obligated to pay the Company certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are achieved. Deferred revenue is recognized over the term of the Biotest license. Deferred revenue is amortized into income for a period of approximately 20 years, the term of the Biotest license agreement. 8 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Depending on the agreement with the customer, product revenues from the sale of human plasma collected at the Company's plasma collection centers are recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which occurs at the time of shipment. Product revenues are recognized at the time of delivery if the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment. Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement have been completed. Revenue from sales of Nabi-HB and Bivigam is recognized when the product reaches the customer's destination. For sales of intermediates, title typically transfers when the product is delivered to a third party warehouse. With all other contract manufacturing, the title transfers to the customer when they take possession of the product from the Boca Facility. As the Company maintains a significant risk of loss throughout the contract manufacturing process, contract manufacturing revenue is not recognized until the product is released and title transfers to the customer. Nabi-HB revenue is net of estimated customer prompt pay discounts and contractual allowances in accordance with managed care agreements, including wholesaler chargebacks, rebates, customer returns and other wholesaler fees. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, two of the Company's customers, SK Plasma Co., Ltd. ("SK") and BPC, represented 90% of the Company's total revenues, with BPC representing approximately 75% of the Company's total revenues and SK representing approximately 15% of the Company's total revenues. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, sales to BPC and SK represented 89% and 10%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated revenues. Cost of product revenue Cost of product revenue includes expenses related to process development as well as scientific and technical operations when these operations are attributable to marketed products. When the activities of these operations are attributable to new products in development, the expenses are classified as research and development expenses. Additionally, expenses associated with remediating the issues noted in the FDA warning letter are expensed as incurred and are reflected in cost of product revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. As the Boca Facility has not yet resumed production, all operating expenses associated with the facility have been expensed as incurred since acquisition. Loss per common share Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For purposes of computing basic and diluted loss per share, the non-voting class of common stock is included in the common stock outstanding as the characteristics of the non-voting class are substantially the same. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, if any, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, including the non-voting class of common stock, and dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common stock includes the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method). Potentially dilutive common stock in the diluted net loss per share computation is excluded to the extent that it would be anti-dilutive. No potentially dilutive securities are included in the computation of any diluted per share amounts as the Company reported a net loss for all periods presented. The aggregate number of potentially dilutive securities upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options was 3.5 million and 1.8 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Stock-based compensation The Company follows recognized accounting guidance which requires all equity-based payments, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the statements of operations as compensation expense, based on their fair values at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and directors with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. 9 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company granted stock options to purchase 1,674,595 and 1,856,595 shares of common stock, respectively, to its directors and employees. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company granted stock options to purchase 15,000 and 100,984 shares of common stock, respectively, to its directors and employees. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Modification Accounting for Share-Based Payment Arrangements , which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. The ASU provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under ASC 718. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations Clarifying the Definition of a Business , which clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The standard introduces a screen for determining when assets acquired are not a business and clarifies that a business must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that contribute to an output to be considered a business. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company adopted this standard in the second quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2017. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, under the ASU, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718), which provides for simplification of certain aspects of employee share-based payment accounting including income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2017. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on their balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires modified retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the standard may have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 10 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 , Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which includes amendments that require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company adopted this standard in the second quarter of 2017. As the Company carried a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments , which includes amendments that require an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the changes to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2017. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . The standard requires entities to measure most inventory "at the lower of cost and net realizable value," thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures, one of which is net realizable value). The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements as and for the six months ended June 30, 2017. In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to revenue recognition, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606") , which outlines a comprehensive revenue recognition model and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. The new guidance requires a company to recognize revenue upon transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the expected consideration to be received in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 defines a five-step approach for recognizing revenue, which may require a company to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. The new guidance becomes effective in calendar year 2018 and early adoption in calendar year 2017 is permitted. Two methods of adoption are permitted: (a) full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented; or (b) modified retrospective adoption, meaning the cumulative effect of applying the new guidance is recognized at the date of initial application as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance. In March 2016, April 2016 and December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue From Contracts with Customers (ASC 606): Principal Versus Agent Considerations , ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue From Contracts with Customers (ASC 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers , respectively, which further clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations contained in ASU No. 2014-09. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients which provides clarification on assessing the collectability criterion, presentation of sales taxes, measurement date for non-cash consideration and completed contracts at transition. These standards will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is permitted. 11 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of June 30, 2017, the Company has not yet completed its final review of the impact of this new revenue recognition guidance, including the new disclosure requirements, as it is continuing to evaluate the impacts of adoption and the implementation approach to be used. The Company plans to adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018. The Company continues to monitor additional changes, modifications, clarifications or interpretations being undertaken by the FASB, which may impact its current conclusions. 3. ACQUISITION On June 6, 2017, ADMA completed the acquisition of the Biotest Assets from BPC. As a result of this transaction, the Company acquired Nabi-HB and Bivigam , the Boca Facility and certain other assets of BTBU. The acquisition of the Biotest Assets expands the Company's product offering with two FDA-approved products and provides direct control over the manufacturing and regulatory processes impacting the Company's RI-002 product candidate, including remediation of the outstanding FDA warning letter previously issued to Biotest as well as certain other remediation items affecting the Boca Facility. Pursuant to the acquisition, the Company issued to Biotest 4,295,580 voting shares of its common stock and 8,591,160 non-voting shares of common stock. The Company will also transfer ownership of two of its plasma centers to Biotest on January 1, 2019 as additional consideration. The purchase price was calculated as follows: The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values: The Company engaged various third party valuation specialists to determine the fair value of the land and buildings, property and equipment, right to intermediates, customer contract and Nabi-HB intangible assets, as well as the assets held for sale. Some of the valuations and underlying analyses that were performed are preliminary and are subject to change upon finalization of more detailed analyses of the facts and circumstances that existed at the date of the transaction. Any such changes would change the allocation of the purchase price. Therefore, the foregoing purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to change within the measurement period. 12 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Assets held for sale reflects certain manufacturing equipment acquired in the transaction that will not be utilized in the manufacture or development of any of the Company's current products or product candidates. The Company expects that the sale of these assets will be completed within one year from the date of the acquisition transaction. Goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. As a result of the foregoing transaction, BPC became a principal stockholder and Biotest became a related party of the Company. Therefore, all transactions with Biotest subsequent to June 6, 2017, including product and license revenues attributable to Biotest (see Note 2), are related party transactions. The results from BTBU's operations are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The Company incurred a total of approximately $5.7 million in transaction closing costs, which were expensed as incurred. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, transaction closing costs amounted to approximately $1.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively. The following unaudited pro forma summary presents consolidated information of the Company as if the business combination had occurred on January 1, 2016. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the acquisition been consummated as of that time or that may result in the future. 4. DEBT A summary of outstanding senior notes payable is as follows: 13 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Senior Notes Payable On June 19, 2015, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the "LSA") with Oxford Finance, LLC ("Oxford"), for up to $21.0 million of debt financing in two term loan tranches. The first term loan tranche of $16.0 million from the LSA (the "Term A Loan") was primarily used to repay the Company's previous debt facility with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. dated December 2012. On May 13, 2016, the Company amended the LSA with Oxford (the "Amended LSA") which provided ADMA with an additional $4.0 million term loan (the "Term B Loan"), which brings the total principal amount borrowed to $20.0 million. The outstanding term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.80% and (ii) the sum of (a) the three-month U.S. LIBOR rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal ) on the date occurring on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 7.54% on the outstanding principal balance. The effective interest rates for the Term A Loan and the Term B Loan, including backend fees equal to 8.95% of the total funded amount, are 11.4% and 13.04%, respectively. The Company began repaying the principal balance on February 1, 2017 in equal installments for a period of 36 months, unless accelerated as a result of certain events of default. The backend fees are due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. All term loans mature no later than January 1, 2020. The loans are secured by the Company's assets, except for its intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). The LSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including limitations on incurring indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions and making investments, distributions or transfers. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of June 30, 2017. In the event the Company prepays a term loan for any reason, the Company is obligated to pay a prepayment charge corresponding to a percentage of the principal amount of the applicable term loan prepaid. The Amended LSA further modified the fees payable by the Company on mandatory or voluntary prepayment of a term loan prior to its maturity date as follows: (i) for a prepayment made on or after the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the first anniversary of its funding date, an amount equal to 3.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid; (ii) for a prepayment made after the first anniversary of the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the second anniversary of such funding date, an amount equal to 2.00% of the principal amount of such term loan prepaid; and (iii) for a prepayment of a term loan made after the second anniversary of its funding date and prior to its maturity date, an amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid. Pursuant to the Amended LSA, (i) the Company paid a total facility fee of $125,000; (ii) certain adjustments were made to the time periods for any applicable prepayment fees; and (iii) certain defined terms were adjusted, including a new February 1, 2017 amortization date. The Amended LSA further provides for customary representations, warranties and covenants for the Company. Except as otherwise amended, the Amended LSA does not alter the terms of the LSA. Related Party Note Payable A summary of the outstanding related party note payable is as follows: In connection with the acquisition of the Biotest Assets (see Note 3), ADMA BioManufacturing issued a subordinated note payable to BPC and in connection therewith received cash proceeds of $15.0 million. The note bears interest at a rate of 6.0% per annum and matures on June 6, 2022. The Company is obligated to make semi-annual interest payments, with all principal and unpaid interest due at maturity. The note is subordinate to the senior note payable with Oxford. In the event of default, all principal and unpaid interest is due on demand. The subordinated note also contains several non-financial covenants with which the Company was in compliance as of June 30, 2017. The Company incurred $0.2 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of this note, which were recorded as a debt discount. The debt discount is being amortized as interest expense over the term of the note. 14 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT) In connection with the acquisition of the Biotest Assets (see Note 3) the Company issued 4,295,580 shares of its voting common stock and 8,591,160 shares of its non-voting common stock, respectively. The rights and preferences of the non-voting common are substantially the same as the common stock. BPC is prohibited from selling such shares for six months following the acquisition of BTBU and is thereafter limited to selling shares of the Company in excess of 15% of the outstanding shares of the Company in a 12-month period. The volume sale restriction expires on the three year anniversary from the BTBU acquisition ("Standstill Period&quot;). The non-voting common stock will automatically convert into common stock upon (i) expiration of the Standstill Period, (ii) a liquidation event, (iii) Company insolvency, (iv) a permitted sale and (v) certain dilutive issuances as defined in the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation. On May 3, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 2,176,154 shares of its common stock, for gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $13.1 million, after payment of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $1.0 million. The shares were sold under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200638) that was declared effective by the SEC on December 23, 2014. Equity incentive plan The fair value of stock options granted under the Company's 2007 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "2007 Plan") and the ADMA Biologics, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended and restated (the "2014 Plan"), was determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. The stock options granted to employees and directors have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Because there has been limited data related to the Company's common stock and very little historical experience with the Company's stock options, similar public companies and a pro rata percentage of the Company's common stock were used for calculating ADMA's volatility for comparison and expectations as to the assumptions required for fair value computation using the Black-Scholes methodology. The following assumptions were used to determine the fair value of options granted during the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016: The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options outstanding and expected to vest at June 30, 2017 is 8.0 years. The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options exercisable at June 30, 2017 is 5.3 years. 15 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A summary of the Company's option activity under the 2007 Plan and 2014 Plan and related information is as follows: Stock-based compensation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: As of June 30, 2017, the total compensation expense related to unvested options not yet recognized totaled $4,934,857. The weighted average vesting period over which the total compensation expense will be recorded related to unvested options not yet recognized at June 30, 2017 was approximately 3.1 years. 6. INVENTORIES The following table provides the components of inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method. Finished goods inventories as of June 30, 2017 is comprised of Nabi-HB , recorded at fair value as part of the purchase price allocation of the Biotest Assets acquired. All activities associated with the production of inventories used in research and development activities are expensed as incurred. 7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 consist of the following: 16 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Under the previous contract manufacturing agreement between ADMA and BPC, intermediate by-products derived from the manufacture of RI-002 were property of Biotest. As a result of the transaction, ADMA now has the right to these intermediate products. The customer contract pertains to a contract manufacturing agreement with a third party that the Company assumed upon the completion of the acquisition of the Biotest Assets. Amortization expense related to these acquisition-related intangible assets for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 was $0.1 million. Estimated aggregate future aggregate amortization expense for the next five years is expected to be as follows: 8. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment and related accumulated depreciation are summarized as follows: Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life. Land is not depreciated. The buildings were assigned a useful life of 30 years. Property and equipment other than land and buildings have useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or their estimated useful lives. 9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company leases an office building and equipment from Areth, LLC ("Areth") pursuant to a shared services agreement on a month-to-month basis of which terms were amended by the Company's Board of Directors in June 2016. Rent expense amounted to $48,000 and $71,888 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 respectively, and $96,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. Areth is a company controlled by Dr. Jerrold B. Grossman, the Company's Vice Chairman, and Adam S. Grossman, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, and the Company pays Areth monthly fees for the use of such office space and for other information technology, general warehousing and administrative services. The Company also reimburses Areth for office and building related (common area) expenses, equipment and certain other operational expenses, which have not been material to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The Company maintains deposits and other accounts at Pascack Bankcorp, a bank of which Dr. Grossman served as a director through January 2016, and which was approximately 5%-owned by members of the Grossman family. Pascack Bankcorp was acquired by Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. in January 2016 and Dr. Grossman is currently a member of the Corporate Advisory Council of Lakeland Bancorp Inc. 17 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of June 30, 2017, the Company has a $15.0 million subordinated note payable to BPC (see Note 4), and recognized approximately $60,000 of interest expense on this note for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized revenues under its out-licensing agreement with Biotest of $35,708 and $71,417, respectively. Deferred revenue of $2,761,450 and $2,832,867 as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is related to this agreement. Biotest is the Company's largest customer for the sale of normal source plasma. Plasma sales to Biotest for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 were approximately $2.4 million and $4.5 million, respectively. Plasma sales to Biotest for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were approximately $1.8 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Accounts receivable includes approximately $1.2 million and $1.0 million due from Biotest as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Additionally, Biotest is a supplier of RSV plasma to ADMA, with the Company purchasing approximately $0.3 million and $0.9 million of RSV plasma in the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Included in accounts payable is approximately $48,000 and $82,000 due to Biotest as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The following table summarizes the related party balances with Biotest: In connection with the acquisition of the Biotest Assets, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement with BPC pursuant to which each of the Company and BPC agreed to provide transition services to the other party, including services related to finance, human resources, information technologies, leasing of equipment and clinical and regulatory services for a period of up to 24 months after the June 6, 2017 closing date, as well as agreements to lease certain laboratory space within the Boca Facility to BPC for a period of up to 24 months after the closing date of the acquisition transaction. As of June 30, 2017, $797,010 was payable by the Company to BPC for services rendered and expenses incurred on behalf of the Company related to these agreements. This amount is reflected in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 18 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Under the terms of the acquisition of the Biotest Assets, the Company will transfer two plasma collection centers to BPC on January 1, 2019. The purchase price payable of $12.6 million as of June 6, 2017 represents the fair value of this obligation. 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES General Legal Matters The Company is and may become subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with the normal course of its business. In the opinion of management, there are currently no claims that would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Operating leases In connection with the acquisition of the Biotest Assets, the Company assumed two warehouse leases in Boca Raton, FL for additional storage space for raw materials, spare parts and other supplies related to its business. These leases expire on December 31, 2017 and July 31, 2018, respectively. The aggregate minimum lease payments for these two leases are approximately $9,000 per month. Additionally, in September 2016, BPC entered into a lease for 36 months for certain specialized equipment related to process development. This equipment is utilized by the Company and the Company reimburses BPC in the approximate amount of $3,500 per month. On February 17, 2017, ADMA BioCenters entered into a lease (the "Lease") with Home Center Properties, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company ("Landlord"), for approximately 12,167 square feet located at 166 Earnest W. Barrett Parkway, Marietta, GA (the "Premises"). ADMA BioCenters will utilize the Premises as a facility specializing in the collection of human plasma and blood, general office administration and any other related use. The Lease has an initial term of approximately eight years and nine months (the "Initial Term"), commencing upon substantial completion of "Landlord's Work" (as defined in the Lease) (the "Lease Commencement Date"), with rent payments commencing 150 days after the Lease Commencement Date. The Lease Commencement Date is July 1, 2017. ADMA BioCenters' total monthly cost of the Premises (inclusive of Landlord's "Operating Costs", "Taxes" and "Insurance Charges" (as such terms are defined in the Lease)) will range from approximately $20,000 to $27,000 during the Initial Term. Provided that the Lease is in full force and effect and that there has been no event of default (as defined in the Lease) beyond the expiration of any applicable notice and cure period, ADMA BioCenters has the option to extend the term of the Lease for two additional periods of five years each (each, an "Extension Term"), each Extension Term on the same terms, covenants and conditions as the Lease, with the rent for each Extension Term to equal the mutually agreed fair market value of the Premises on the commencement of such Extension Term. The Lease also contains customary default provisions, representations, warranties and covenants. Contract manufacturing agreement In connection with the acquisition of the Biotest Assets, the Company acquired all of the rights and assumed all of the obligations under an existing agreement with a third party related to the fractionation of plasma provided by the third party. The agreement terminates on December 31, 2020, with 2020 being a wind-down year. All other years have minimum production requirements as well as a payment due to the counterparty to the contract of $1.5 million per year if a minimum of 11 batches are not manufactured in that year. 19 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Contract filler agreement The Company has an agreement with a third party to fill and package its plasma for sale to customers. BTBU's agreement with this same contract filler to package Nabi-HB and Bivigam was not assigned to ADMA in the acquisition of the Biotest Assets. This contract filler is the only provider approved by the FDA to fill and package these products. The Company is currently working with the contract filler to amend its current agreement to include Nabi-HB and Bivigam in the existing ADMA contract. At this time, the Company is not able to determine the impact that the proposed amendment would have on the overall terms of the contract. Post-marketing commitments In connection with the approval of the BLA for Bivigam , on December 19, 2012 Biotest committed to perform two additional post-marketing studies. The first is a pediatric study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bivigam in children and adolescents, and the second is a post-authorization safety study to further assess the potential risk of hypotension and hepatic and renal impairment in Bivigam -treated patients with Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency. These studies are still pending completion, ADMA has assumed the remaining obligations, and the costs of the studies will be expensed as they are incurred. The Company currently expects both studies to be completed by the end of 2021. However, the timing of the completion of these studies is dependent upon the availability of Bivigam and the completion of the planned manufacturing process improvements. 11. SEGMENTS The Company is engaged in the development, manufacturing and commercialization of human plasma and plasma-derived therapeutics. The Company's ADMA BioManufacturing segment reflects the Company's immune globulin manufacturing and development operations in Florida, acquired on June 6, 2017 (see Note 3). The Plasma Collection Centers segment consists of two FDA-licensed source plasma collection facilities located in Georgia, with a third collection center scheduled to open in late 2017 (see Note 10). The Company defines its segments as those business units whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company's CODM is its President and Chief Executive Officer. Summarized financial information concerning reportable segments is shown in the following tables: 20 ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION Supplemental cash flow information for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION: 22 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion, which refers to our historical results, should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including "Risk Factors" and the consolidated financial statements and other consolidated financial information included elsewhere herein, and in conjunction with the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 . The various sections of this discussion contain a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Our actual results may differ materially. Overview ADMA Biologics, Inc. ("ADMA", the "Company", "we", "our" or "us") is a vertically integrated biopharmaceutical and specialty immunoglobulin company that develops, manufactures and markets specialty plasma-based biologics for the treatment of immune deficiencies and prevention of certain infectious diseases. Our targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disorder or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. Our product candidates are intended to be used by physician specialists focused on caring for immune-compromised patients with or at risk for certain infectious diseases. On June 6, 2017, we completed the acquisition of certain assets (the "Biotest Assets") of the Therapy Business Unit ("BTBU") of Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("BPC" and, together with Biotest AG, "Biotest"), which includes two United States Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") licensed products, Nabi-HB (Hepatitis B Immune Globulin, Human) and Bivigam (Immune Globulin Intravenous, Human) (the "Biotest Transaction"). These products are manufactured at the Company's plasma fractionation facility located in Boca Raton, Florida (the "Boca Facility") acquired in the Biotest Transaction. The facility is FDA-licensed and certified by the German Health Authority. Immediately following the acquisition, the Biotest Assets were contributed into our ADMA BioManufacturing, LLC ("ADMA BioManufacturing") subsidiary. Nabi-HB is a hyperimmune globulin that is rich in antibodies to the hepatitis B virus. Nabi-HB is indicated for the treatment of acute exposure to blood containing hepatitis B surface antigen ("HBsAg"), prenatal exposure to infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, sexual exposure to HBs-Ag-positive persons and household exposure to persons with acute hepatitis B virus infection. Bivigam is an Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10% Liquid, indicated for the treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiency. In addition to Nabi-HB and Bivigam , ADMA also provides contract manufacturing for certain clients, including the sale of intermediate by-products. Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition of the Biotest Assets, the Company received a $15.0 million loan from Biotest evidenced by a 6% subordinated note payable to BPC with a maturity of 5 years (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), and BPC committed to participate in any future equity offering or private placement undertaken by the Company in an amount equal to $12.5 million. Our Lead Product Candidate RI-002 We are currently developing our lead product candidate, RI-002, for the treatment of PIDD, and have completed a pivotal Phase III clinical study. RI-002 is derived from human plasma blended from normal donors and donors tested to have high levels of neutralizing titers to Respiratory Syncytial Virus ("RSV"). RI-002 is manufactured using a process called fractionation, which purifies immune globulins, or IgG, from this blended plasma pool resulting in a final Intravenous Immune Globulin, or IVIG, product enriched with naturally occurring polyclonal anti-pathogen antibodies (e.g., streptococcus pneumonia, H. influenza type B, Cytomegalovirus or CMV, measles, tetanus, etc.). We use our proprietary RSV microneutralization assay to test for standardized levels of neutralizing antibodies to RSV in the final drug product. 23 In the third quarter of 2015, the FDA accepted for review our Biologics License Application (the "BLA") for RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD. In July 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (the "CRL"). The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety or efficacy data for RI-002 submitted in the BLA, nor did the FDA request any additional clinical studies be completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002. The FDA identified in the CRL, among other things, certain outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies relating to Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC, at our then-third party contract manufacturer and the Boca Facility which, at the time, was owned by BPC, and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues. The FDA indicated in the CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things, these deficiencies are resolved. Since receiving the CRL, we have worked diligently with our contract fill and finisher as well as the contract testing laboratory. Both prior to the closing of the Biotest Transaction and thereafter, we have continued our efforts to address the CRL and remediate the outstanding warning letter, Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMP") inspection deficiencies and other matters at the Boca Facility. Our highest priority is to remediate the outstanding compliance issues identified at the Boca Facility in the previously issued FDA warning letter, and we plan to be inspection-ready for the FDA by the end of 2017. We continue to collaborate with vendors to identify solutions to outstanding issues identified in the CRL. We are currently preparing documentation for an additional submission to the FDA to address the CRL. With the completion of the Biotest Transaction, we now have control over the drug substance manufacturing process and we anticipate that we will be in a position to refile the BLA for RI-002 in the middle of 2018. Nabi-HB Nabi-HB is a hyperimmune globulin that is rich in antibodies to the Hepatitis B virus. Nabi-HB is a purified human polyclonal antibody product collected from plasma donors who have been previously vaccinated with a hepatitis B vaccine. When administered, the hepatitis B antibody contained in Nabi-HB binds to the Hepatitis B virus and triggers its clearance by the body's immune system. Nabi-HB has a well-documented record of long-term safety and effectiveness since its initial market introduction. Nabi-HB is indicated for the treatment of acute exposure to blood containing Hepatitis B surface antigen ("HBsAg"), prenatal exposure to infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, sexual exposure to HBsAg-positive persons and household exposure to persons with acute hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem. It can cause chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Bivigam Bivigam is an intravenous immune globulin, indicated for the treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiency. This includes, but is not limited to, agammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and severe combined immunodeficiency. These primary immunodeficiencies ("PIs") are a group of genetic disorders. Initially thought to be very rare, it is now believed that as many as one in every 1,200-2,000 people has some form of PI. Bivigam contains a broad range of antibodies similar to those found in normal human plasma. These antibodies are directed against bacteria and viruses, and help to protect PI patients against serious infections. Bivigam is a purified, sterile, ready-to-use preparation of concentrated human immunoglobulin G ("IgG") antibodies. Antibodies are proteins in the human immune system that work to defend against disease. FDA approval for Bivigam was received on December 19, 2012, and sales commenced in the first quarter of 2013. In December 2016, BPC temporarily suspended the commercial production of Bivigam in order to focus on the completion of planned improvements to the process. Bivigam is not expected to be available for sale throughout the remainder of 2017. Evaluation of PIDD Patients PIDD, a genetic disorder that causes a deficient or absent immune system, is caused by hereditary or genetic defects and can affect anyone regardless of age or gender. PIDD patients are more vulnerable to infections and more likely to suffer complications from these infections. IVIG is a plasma derived product that is used to prevent serious infections in patients with PIDD. It is comprised of polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins produced by B-cells that are used by the body's immune system to neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses. It is estimated that there are about 250,000 diagnosed PIDD patients in the U.S., approximately half of whom are treated with IVIG regularly. In the U.S., sales of immune globulin products for all its uses were reported to be approximately $4.8 billion in 2014. 24 The RI-002 pivotal Phase III clinical trial was conducted as a single arm study in which patients were treated approximately once per month for a period of 12 months plus 90 days for follow up. Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in nine treatment centers in the U.S. The pivotal Phase III primary endpoint followed published FDA industry guidance, which provides for a reduction in the incidence of serious infections to less than one per year in each subject receiving IVIG. The secondary outcome was safety and included other pharmacokinetic, or PK, data collection points including antibody titers for certain agents, including RSV antibody levels at various time points after infusion. RI-002 demonstrated positive results in the Phase III study in patients with PIDD, meeting its primary endpoint, of no Serious Bacterial Infections, or SBI, reported. RI-002 was administered in a total of 793 infusions with zero serious adverse events to 59 patients in nine treatment centers throughout the U.S. These results, included in the BLA, more than meet the requirement specified by FDA guidance of 1 SBI per patient-year. On February 22, 2015, at the 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology Annual Meeting, scientific investigators reported on the secondary outcomes that included: a total of 93 days, or 1.66 days per patient per year lost from work or school due to infection; one hospitalization due to an infection of only five days duration in the entire study and IgG trough levels above those required by the FDA for IVIG products. Additionally, there was a marked increase in all of the measured specific anti-pathogen antibodies in PK subjects (n=31). The mean of maximum fold increases in specific antibody levels after infusion of RI-002 ranged from 1.9 fold (S. pneumonia type 19A) to 5.3 fold (RSV), which were statistically significant fold increases from the pathogen's specific measured baselines. The safety profile of RI-002 is comparable to that of other immunoglobulins. Rationale for the Potential Evaluation in RSV Infected Patients RSV is a common virus that ordinarily leads to mild, cold-like symptoms in healthy adults and children. In high-risk groups, such as the PIDD population and the other immune-compromised populations, RSV can lead to a more serious infection and may even cause death. The polyclonal antibodies which are present in RI-002 are expected to prevent infections in immune-compromised patients. We previously conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to evaluate RI-001, RI-002's predecessor product candidate, in immune-compromised, RSV-infected patients. This trial was conducted with 21 patients in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Phase II dose-ranging trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline RSV titers to day 18 in the high dose and low dose treatment groups when compared with placebo (p=0.0043 and p=0.0268, respectively). The mean fold increase for high dose was 9.24 (95% CI 4.07, 21.02) and the observed mean fold increase for low dose was 4.85 (95% CI 2.22, 10.59). The mean fold change for placebo treated patients was 1.42 (95% CI 0.64, 3.17). In addition, more patients in the high dose (85.7%) and low dose (42.9%) groups experienced greater than a four-fold increase from baseline to day 18 in RSV titer levels compared to placebo (0%). There were no serious drug-related adverse events reported during the trial. From April 2009 through February 2011, RI-001 was also administered to 15 compassionate use patients where physicians requested access to the product for treating their patients with documented lower respiratory tract RSV infections due to the fact that these patients had failed conventional therapeutic interventions. Serum samples were obtained from 13 patients. Samples showed that patients demonstrated a four-fold or greater rise in RSV antibody titers from baseline. Serum samples were not obtained from two patients that received Palivizumab. All 11 patients who received RI-001 within 4.2 days after the onset of the diagnosis of RSV survived. The drug was well-tolerated in all 15 patients and there were no reports of serious adverse events attributable to RI-001. Data from our Phase II clinical trial, compassionate use experience and data obtained from the evaluation of RI-002 in the infected cotton rat animal model has been presented at various conferences the past several years. Based on these results, we intend to evaluate RI-002 for the treatment of RSV patients following FDA approval, if received, for treatment of PIDD. 25 Commercialization While we are working towards remediating the warning letter and other GMP inspection deficiencies and eventually refiling the BLA resubmission for RI-002, we expect to continue our commercialization efforts and plan to increase our initiatives by hiring a small, specialty sales force to market Nabi-HB , Bivigam upon its relaunch and, upon approval by the FDA, RI-002 to hospitals, physician offices/clinics, and other specialty treatment organizations. We anticipate staffing our company with additional personnel for patient support, medical affairs, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, scientific affairs, reimbursement, inventory and logistics, human resources and financial and operational management. If and when we receive FDA approval, we may also use a network of national distributors to assist with order fulfillment for RI-002 for use by healthcare professionals and hospitals. Intellectual Property During the second quarter of 2015, U.S. Pat. App. Serial No. 14/592,721, entitled 'Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Immunodeficiency', encompassing our RI-002 product, was allowed and issued August 18, 2015 as U.S. Patent No. 9,107,906. The '906 patent has a term at least through January 2035 and covers compositions comprising pooled plasma, as well as immunoglobulin prepared therefrom, that contains a standardized, elevated titer of RSV neutralizing antibodies as well as elevated levels of antibodies specific for one or more other respiratory pathogens, as well as methods of making and using the compositions. Our proprietary methods allow us to effectively identify and isolate donor plasma with high-titer RSV neutralizing antibodies and to standardize RI-002's antibody profile, which we believe may enable us to garner a premium price. During the third quarter of 2017, U.S. Pat. App. Serial No. 14/790,872, entitled 'Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Immunodeficiency', encompassing immunotherapeutic methods of using immune globulin compositions proprietary to ADMA, was allowed and issued July 25, 2017 as U.S. Patent No. 9,714,283. The '283 patent has a term at least through January 2035. Plasma Collection Facilities Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA Bio Centers Georgia, Inc., ("ADMA BioCenters"), operates two FDA-licensed, German Health Authority, or GHA, and Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MFDS, certified source plasma collection facilities located in Norcross, GA and Marietta, GA, which provide us with a portion of our blood plasma for the manufacture of RI-002. A typical plasma collection center, such as those operated by ADMA BioCenters, can collect approximately 30,000 to 50,000 liters of source plasma annually, which may be sold for different prices depending upon the type of plasma, quantity of purchase, and market conditions at the time of sale. Plasma collected from ADMA BioCenters' two Georgia facilities that is not used for making RI-002 is sold to third-party customers in the U.S., and other locations where we are approved globally under supply agreements or in the open &quot;spot&quot; market. As part of the purchase price to acquire the Biotest Assets, we have agreed to transfer ownership of our two existing plasma collection facilities to BPC on January 1, 2019. We are in the process of opening a third plasma collection facility in Georgia, which we expect will become operational by the end of 2017. Financial Operations Overview Revenues Revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 are comprised of Nabi-HB product revenues, product revenues from the sale of normal source human plasma collected from our plasma collection centers segment and license and other revenues which are initially recorded as deferred revenue and amortized into income over the terms of the respective agreements. In exchange for the out-licensing of RI-002 to market and sell in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East, Biotest has provided us with certain services and a financial payment received in accordance with the related license agreement and is obligated to pay us certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are achieved. 26 A significant amount of our revenues are attributed to a single customer, BPC. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, two of our customers, SK Plasma Co., Ltd. ("SK") and BPC, represented approximately 90% of our total revenues, with BPC representing 75% of our total revenues and SK representing 15% of our total revenues. Product revenues from the sale of human plasma collected at our FDA-licensed plasma collection centers are recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which occurs, depending on the agreement with the customer, at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery if we retain the risk of loss during shipment. Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement have been completed. Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue includes manufacturing salaries and wages, indirect overhead charges and consulting fees associated with remediating the outstanding warning letter with the FDA, which are expensed as incurred. As the Boca Facility has not yet resumed production, all operating expenses associated with the facility have been expensed as incurred since acquisition. Research and Development Expenses Research and development ("R&amp;D") expenses consist of clinical research organization costs, costs related to our clinical trials, consulting expenses relating to regulatory and medical affairs, quality assurance and control, assay development, ongoing testing costs, drug product manufacturing including the cost of plasma, plasma storage and transportation costs, as well as wages, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees directly related to the R&amp;D of RI-002. All R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred. The process of conducting preclinical studies, clinical trials and regulatory activities necessary to obtain FDA approval is costly and time consuming. The probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the quality of the product candidate's early clinical data, investment in the program, competition, regulatory, manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, the uncertainties associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, R&amp;D expenses decreased as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to lower validation, testing and production costs related to RI-002. In connection with the approval of the BLA for Bivigam on December 19, 2012, BTBU committed to perform two additional post-marketing studies. The first is a pediatric study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bivigam in children and adolescents, and the second is a post-authorization safety study to further assess the potential risk of hypotension and hepatic and renal impairment in Bivigam-treated patients with Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency. These studies are pending completion, and the costs of the studies will be expensed as they are incurred. We currently expect both studies to be completed by the end of 2021. However, the timing of the completion of these studies is dependent upon the availability of Bivigam and the completion of the planned manufacturing process improvements. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative ("SG&amp;A") expenses consist of costs related to the Biotest Transaction, wages, salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits for senior management and staff unrelated to R&amp;D, legal fees, accounting and auditing fees, commercialization and marketing activities, information technology, investor relations fees, rent, maintenance and utilities, insurance, travel and other expenses related to the general operations of our business. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, SG&amp;A expenses primarily increased as a result of expenses incurred in connection with the Biotest Transaction, including fees paid for legal, accounting, and financial advisory fees related to the issuance of a fairness opinion and due diligence fees. 27 Other Income and Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest expense consists of interest incurred on our notes payable and term loan, as well as the amortization of end of term fees, back end fees, value of warrants issued, facility and financing fees. Results of Operations Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Summary table The following table presents a summary of the changes in our results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016: Revenues We recorded total revenues of $3,399,401 during the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $2,271,744 during the three months ended June 30, 2016. Total revenues include sales of: (i) Nabi-HB in the amount of $539,223 for 2017, net of chargebacks and discounts, with no comparable amount in 2016, (ii) product revenue of $2,824,470 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, which is attributable to our ADMA BioCenters plasma collection centers segment and derived from the sale of human source plasma, compared to product revenue of $2,236,036 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and (iii) license and other revenue in the amount of $35,708 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, which pertains to services and financial payments provided by Biotest in accordance with our license agreement. The increase in product revenue of $588,434 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to increased sales generated from our plasma supply agreement with SK, under which SK purchases normal source plasma from ADMA BioCenters. The normal source plasma and high-titer RSV plasma which we did not sell was allocated to inventory in anticipation of commercial manufacturing. We have not generated any revenue from our therapeutics research and development business. Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue was $4,334,019 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and $1,344,241 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in cost of product revenue of $2,989,778 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to manufacturing costs related to the Boca Facility, the production of Nabi-HB, third-party consultant fees pertaining to the remediation efforts in response to the warning letter and increased revenues generated by our plasma collection centers. 28 Research and Development Expenses R&amp;D expenses were $1,358,409 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $2,041,480 as compared to $3,399,889 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease is primarily the result of lower validation, testing and production costs related to RI-002 in 2017, due to receipt of the CRL from the FDA during the third quarter of 2016. Plasma Center Operating Expenses Plasma center operating expenses were $1,600,170 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $305,869 as compared to $1,294,301 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Plasma center operating expenses consist of: general and administrative plasma center costs; overhead comprised of rent, maintenance, utilities, wages, stock-based compensation and benefits for center staff, plasma collection supplies, plasma transportation and storage (off-site); advertising and promotion expenses and computer software fees related to donor collections. The increase in plasma center expenses is attributable to hiring additional staff and increasing the hours of operations at our Marietta, GA location during the first quarter of 2017. We expect that as plasma collection increases, our operating expenses will increase accordingly. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&amp;A expenses were $4,435,650 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $2,711,487 from $1,724,163 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. SG&amp;A expenses primarily increased due to transaction costs of $1,205,126, including fees paid for legal, accounting and financial advisory services related to due diligence and other costs associated with the acquisition of the Biotest Assets and the issuance of a fairness opinion, as well as higher employee compensation costs of approximately $500,000. In addition, the inclusion of BTBU resulted in an additional $969,154 of SG&amp;A expenses in 2017. Loss from Operations Our operating loss was $8,401,868 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $5,490,850 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in operating loss was mainly due to the higher SG&amp;A expenses and to the manufacturing costs associated with the Boca Facility in 2017 of approximately $2 million reflected in cost of product revenue, partially offset by lower R&amp;D expenses. Loss from operations also includes $73,021 for amortization of intangible assets recognized in the Biotest Transaction. Other Income (Expense); Interest Expense Other expense, net was $634,627 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $521,485 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The increase of $113,142 is primarily related to increased interest expense and debt discount amortization resulting from an increase of $4,000,000 to our current debt in the second quarter of 2016 and to interest on the note payable to Biotest of approximately $60,000. Net Loss Net loss was $9,036,495 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $3,024,160 from $6,012,335 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in operating loss and, to a lesser extent, the increase in interest expense. Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Summary table The following table presents a summary of the changes in our results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016: 29 Revenues We recorded total revenues of $6,028,272 during the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $4,395,630 during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Total revenues include sales of: (i) Nabi-HB in the amount of $539,223 for 2017, net of chargebacks and discounts, with no comparable amount in 2016, (ii) product revenue of $5,417,632 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 attributable to our ADMA BioCenters plasma collection centers segment, compared to product revenue of $4,324,213 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, and (iii) license and other revenue in the amount of $71,417 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 in accordance with our license agreement with Biotest. The increase in product revenue of $1,093,419 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to increased sales generated from our plasma supply agreement with SK, under which SK purchases normal source plasma from ADMA BioCenters. Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue was $5,950,306 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, and $2,610,662 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $3,339,644. Cost of product revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 includes approximately $2 million of costs associated with the Boca Facility, including fees paid to third-party consultants providing remediation services for the warning letter. The remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to the manufacturing of Nabi-HB and increased plasma center revenues. Research and Development Expenses R&amp;D expenses were $2,551,136 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $2,876,465 as compared to $5,427,601 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in R&amp;D expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily the result of lower validation, testing and production costs related to RI-002 due to receipt of the CRL from the FDA during the third quarter of 2016. Plasma Center Operating Expenses Plasma center operating expenses were $3,079,646 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $504,926 as compared to $2,574,720 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in plasma center expenses is attributable to hiring additional staff and increasing the hours of operations at our Marietta, GA location during the first quarter of 2017. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&amp;A expenses were $8,713,034 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $5,281,001 from $3,432,033 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. G&amp;A expenses primarily increased due to transaction costs of $3,774,971, including fees paid for legal, accounting and financial advisory services related to due diligence and other costs associated with the acquisition of the Biotest Assets and the issuance of a fairness opinion, as well as increased employee compensation costs of approximately $500,000. In addition, the inclusion of BTBU resulted in an additional $969,154 of SG&amp;A expenses in 2017. 30 Loss from Operations Our operating loss was $14,338,871 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $4,689,485 from $9,649,386 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase was mainly the result of the increase in SG&amp;A expenses, as well as lower gross profit attributable to operating costs of the Boca Facility which were not present in 2016, partially offset by lower R&amp;D expenses. Other Income (Expense); Interest Expense Other expense, net was $1,234,587 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $975,418 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase of $259,169 is primarily related to increased interest expense, including amortization of debt discount, resulting from the increase of $4,000,000 to our current debt in the second quarter of 2016 and the note payable to BPC. Net Loss Net loss was $15,573,458 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $4,948,654 from $10,624,804 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase was mainly due to the increase in operating loss and interest expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, 2017, the Company had working capital of $28.6 million, consisting primarily of $25.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.3 million of accounts receivable, $13.2 million of inventories, $0.8 million of assets held for sale and $2.4 million of prepaid expenses, partially offset by the current portion of notes payable in the amount of $6.7 million, $4.7 million of accounts payable, $4.1 million of accrued expenses and $0.2 million of deferred revenue and other current liabilities. We have had limited revenue from operations, we have incurred cumulative losses of $122.5 million since inception and for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 we had negative cash flows from operations of $14.2 million and $10.0 million, respectively. We have funded our operations to date primarily from the sale of our equity securities, loans from venture debt lenders, acquisition proceeds and loans from our primary stockholders. In May 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock and we received net proceeds of approximately $12.9 million. Also in May 2016, we amended our Loan and Security Agreement (the "LSA") with Oxford Finance, LLC ("Oxford") and borrowed an additional $4.0 million. In June 2017, we received $27.5 million in connection with the Biotest Transaction, including a cash infusion from BPC into the acquired business in the amount of $12.5 million and an unsecured subordinated 6% note payable to BPC in the amount of $15.0 million. In addition, BPC has provided us with a firm equity commitment to invest an additional $12.5 million in future equity financings of the Company. Our funds are being used and have been used: to conduct clinical trials; to manufacture drug products; to collect and procure plasma; to test plasma donors for RSV titers; to file our BLA for RI-002; to conduct pre-launch activities; for commercialization and marketing activities; for the buildout and expansion of our plasma centers; for expenses related to the Biotest Transaction, remediation of the warning letter at the Boca Facility and the remainder for payment of existing accounts payable; for selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses; and for other business activities and general corporate purposes. Future Financing Needs We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on product development, quality and regulatory activities, procuring raw material plasma, manufacturing, conducting clinical trials for our product candidates and purchasing clinical trial materials from our suppliers. We currently anticipate that, based upon our projected revenue and expenditures, our current cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable, along with the additional equity commitment from Biotest, will be sufficient to fund our operations into the first quarter of 2018. In order to have sufficient cash to fund our operations thereafter and to continue as a going concern, we will need to raise additional equity or debt financing by the end of the first quarter of 2018. This time frame may change based upon how quickly we are able to execute on our quality management systems' remediation plans for the ADMA BioManufacturing operations, commercial manufacturing scale up activities and the various financing options we are exploring, including the potential refinancing of our current senior debt which, if achieved on favorable terms, would be expected to allow us to extend our current cash runway from the first quarter of 2018 well into the second half of 2018 and perhaps further, depending on the timing and structuring of the loan facility. We currently have no firm commitments for additional financing other than the equity commitment from Biotest, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to secure additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business plan and financial performance and we could be forced to delay, discontinue our product development, clinical trial or commercialization activities, delay or discontinue the approval efforts for any of our potential products, or potentially cease operations. In addition, we could be forced to reduce or forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities. 31 Furthermore, if the assumptions underlying our estimated expenses are incorrect, we may have to raise additional capital sooner than anticipated. Because of numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research and development and potential future commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our anticipated clinical trials and development activities. Our current estimates may be subject to change as circumstances regarding our business requirements evolve. We may decide to raise capital through public or private equity offerings and such financings may only be available on unattractive terms, resulting in significant dilution of stockholders' interests and, in such event, the value and potential future market price of our common stock may decline. We may also decide to obtain debt financing or a bank credit facility or to enter into corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if convertible, could result in dilution to our current stockholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations or other future financing alternatives. Our long-term liquidity depends upon our ability to raise additional capital, to fund our research and development and commercial programs and meet our obligations on a timely basis. We believe that we will continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities through the foreseeable future. As such, these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: 32 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities The following table illustrates the primary components of our cash flows from operations: Cash used in operations increased by $4,201,667, mainly due to the higher net loss, increase in accounts receivable and higher increases in prepaid expenses and security deposits primarily associated with the acquisition of the Biotest Assets, partially offset by larger increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $17,793,627 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, which reflects the $12,500,000 of cash received by us in connection with the acquisition of the Biotest Assets, and the redemptions of short-term investments in the amount of $5,390,184. Net cash used in investing activities was $4,960,820 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which was related to the purchase of short-term investments of $4,902,786 and $58,034 in purchases of computers and equipment. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $12,039,289 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, which primarily consisted of $15,000,000 received from the issuance of the note payable to BPC, partially offset by repayments on the principal balances of our notes payable to Oxford, which the Company became obligated to begin repaying over 36 months beginning February 1, 2017 in accordance with the terms of the LSA, as amended. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $17,041,141 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which primarily consisted of $13,072,741 of net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock during the second quarter of 2016 and $4,000,000 received from Oxford during the second quarter of 2016. Effect of Inflation Inflation did not have a significant impact on our net sales, revenues or net loss in 2014, 2015 or 2016, or for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2017-09, Modification Accounting for Share-Based Payment Arrangements , which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. The ASU provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under ASC 718. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 33 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations Clarifying the Definition of a Business , which clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The standard introduces a screen for determining when assets acquired are not a business and clarifies that a business must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that contribute to an output to be considered a business. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We adopted this standard in the second quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2017. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, under the ASU, "an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718) , which provides for simplification of certain aspects of employee share-based payment accounting including income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2017. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on their balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires modified retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard may have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which includes amendments that require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We adopted this standard in the second quarter of 2017. Because we carry a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments , which includes amendments that require an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the changes to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2017. 34 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . The standard requires entities to measure most inventory "at the lower of cost and net realizable value," thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures, one of which is net realizable value). We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2017. In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to revenue recognition, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606") , which outlines a comprehensive revenue recognition model and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. The new guidance requires a company to recognize revenue upon transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the expected consideration to be received in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 defines a five-step approach for recognizing revenue, which may require a company to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. The new guidance becomes effective in calendar year 2018 and early adoption in calendar year 2017 is permitted. Two methods of adoption are permitted: (a) full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented; or (b) modified retrospective adoption, meaning the cumulative effect of applying the new guidance is recognized at the date of initial application as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance. In March 2016, April 2016 and December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue From Contracts with Customers (ASC 606): Principal Versus Agent Considerations , ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue From Contracts with Customers (ASC 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers , respectively, which further clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations contained in ASU No. 2014-09. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients which provides clarification on assessing the collectability criterion, presentation of sales taxes, measurement date for non-cash consideration and completed contracts at transition. These standards will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is permitted. As of June 30, 2017, we has not yet completed its final review of the impact of this guidance including the new disclosure requirements, as we are continuing to evaluate the impacts of adoption and the implementation approach to be used. We plan to adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018. We continue to monitor additional changes, modifications, clarifications or interpretations being undertaken by the FASB, which may impact our current conclusions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We could be an emerging growth company until December 31, 2018, which is the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a "large accelerated filer," our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. As an "emerging growth company," we may, under Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We may take advantage of this extended transition period until the first to occur of the date that we (i) are no longer an "emerging growth company" or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this extended transition period. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our condensed consolidated financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Until the date that we are no longer an "emerging growth company" or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B), upon issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to our condensed consolidated financial statements and that has a different effective date for public and private companies, we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for non-emerging growth companies and the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard. As an emerging growth company, we are also exempt from the requirement to have our independent auditors provide an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. 35 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and assumptions, including those described below. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates. Some of the estimates and assumptions we have to make under GAAP require difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the estimation processes involved, the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period on a straight-line basis. We account for stock options granted to non-employees on a fair value basis using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. The noncash charge to operations for non-employee options with vesting is revalued at the end of each reporting period based upon the change in the fair value of the options and amortized to consulting expense over the related contract service period. For purposes of valuing stock options granted to our employees, non-employees and directors and officers through the six months ended June 30, 2017, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We granted options to purchase an aggregate of 1,856,595 and 100,984 shares of common stock during the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. To determine the risk-free interest rate, we utilized the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant with a term consistent with the expected term of our awards. The expected term of the options granted is in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletins 107 and 110, which is based on the average between vesting terms and contractual terms. The expected dividend yield reflects our current and expected future policy for dividends on our common stock. The expected stock price volatility for our stock options was calculated by examining the pro rata historical volatilities for similar publicly traded industry peers and the trading history for our common stock. We will continue to analyze the expected stock price volatility and expected term assumptions. Research and Development Costs Our R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred, including costs associated with (i) planning and conducting clinical trials; (ii) drug product manufacturing, including the cost of plasma, plasma storage and transportation costs; (iii) quality testing, validation, regulatory consulting and filing fees; and (iv) employees' compensation expenses directly related to R&amp;D activities. Revenue Recognition Depending on the agreement with the customer, revenue from the sale of human plasma collected by ADMA BioCenters is recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which usually occurs at the time of shipment. Product revenue is recognized at the time of delivery if we retain the risk of loss during shipment. Our current product revenues are substantially attributable to two customers. One customer accounted for 75% and another customer accounted for 15% of our product revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Although we expect this concentration to decrease over the remainder of the year as additional sales of Nabi-HB are reflected in our consolidated financial statements, these two customers are still expected to account for a significant portion of our revenues. Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement with Biotest have been completed. 36 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements None.
