AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016      1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS     ADMA Biologics, Inc. ("ADMA" or the "Company") is a late stage biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and intends to commercialize specialty plasma-based biologics for the proposed treatment of immune deficiencies and prevention of certain infectious diseases. The Company's targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disease or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. Our product candidates are intended to be used by physician specialists focused on caring for immune-compromised patients with or at risk for certain infectious diseases. ADMA also operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA Bio Centers Georgia, Inc. ("ADMA BioCenters"), a source plasma collection business with U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approved facilities in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia. Each facility holds certifications from the German Health Authority ("GHA") and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety ("MFDS"). ADMA BioCenters supplies ADMA with a portion of its raw material plasma for the manufacture of RI-002, ADMA's lead product candidate, which the Company is currently developing for the treatment of Primary Immune Deficiency Disease ("PIDD"). A Biologics License Application ("BLA") for RI-002 was submitted to the FDA and accepted for review during the third quarter of 2015. In July 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter ("CRL") to the Company for its BLA for RI-002. The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety and efficacy data for RI-002, nor did the FDA request any additional clinical studies be completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002. The FDA identified in the CRL, among other things, certain outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies at ADMA's third-party contract manufacturers and vendors and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues. The FDA indicated in the CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things, these deficiencies are resolved. Since receiving the CRL, the Company has worked diligently with its contract fill and finisher as well as the contract testing laboratory. The Company has also continued to work with its third-party contract manufacturer, Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("BPC " or "Seller"), and on January 21, 2017, the Company signed a definitive acquisition agreement to acquire certain manufacturing and therapy-related assets from Biotest in Boca Raton, Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biotest Aktiengesellschaft ("Biotest"), in efforts to address the CRL and remediate the outstanding warning letter at the manufacturing facility. The acquisition of certain manufacturing and therapy-related assets of Biotest (the "Proposed Acquisition") is anticipated to close in June 2017. The Company and its vendors are awaiting certain feedback from the agency on submissions already made and the Company intends to provide a timeline for resubmission of the BLA for RI-002 as soon as practicable.     In May 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million, and subsequently borrowed an additional $4.0 million under its Loan and Security Agreement ("LSA") with Oxford Finance LLC ("Oxford"), which brought the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million (See Footnote 3).     As of March 31, 2017, the Company had working capital of $2.7 million, consisting primarily of $8.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $0.3 million of short-term investments, $0.8 million of accounts receivable, $5.3 million of inventories, and $0.7 million of prepaid expenses, offset primarily by the current portion of note payable due to Oxford of $6.7 million, $3.9 million of accounts payable, $2.2 million of accrued expenses and $0.1 million of deferred revenue. Based upon the Company's projected revenue and expenditures for 2017, including the fees associated with the Proposed Acquisition of certain BPC assets, regulatory and consulting fees for RI-002 associated with third-party manufacturers and ongoing discussions with the FDA, continuing implementation of the Company's commercialization and expansion activities and certain other assumptions, management currently believes that its cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, projected revenue and accounts receivable are sufficient to fund ADMA's operations, as currently conducted, into the second half of 2017. These estimates may change based upon the timing of the closing of the Proposed Acquisition of certain BPC assets, whether or when the FDA approves RI-002, the timing of any required commercial manufacturing scale up activities or if any other assumptions of the Company change. This timing may also change based upon the timing of the completion of the Proposed Acquisition, anticipated in June 2017. Upon the closing of the Proposed Acquisition, BPC will be providing funds to ADMA consisting of: $12.5 million in funding, $15.0 million in debt financing and an additional $12.5 million commitment towards a future equity financing is expected to be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of 2018. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully close on the Proposed Acquisition. Other than the funding to be provided by BPC, the Company does not currently have arrangements to obtain additional financing. Furthermore, if the Company's assumptions underlying its estimated expenses and revenues are incorrect, it may have to raise additional capital sooner than anticipated. Due to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research and development and potential future commercialization of its product candidate, the Company is unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with its development activities. The Company's current estimates may be subject to change as circumstances regarding its business requirements evolve. The Company may decide to raise capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings, or obtain a bank credit facility or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. The Company does not have any existing commitments for future external funding. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if convertible, could result in dilution to the Company's stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict the Company's operations or other financing alternatives. Additional equity or debt financing, grants, or corporate collaboration and potential licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate the Company's research and development programs, reduce the Company's planned clinical trials and delay or abandon potential commercialization efforts of the Company's lead or other product candidates. The Company has reported losses since inception in June 2004 through March 31, 2017 of $113.5 million. Management believes that the Company will continue to incur net losses and negative net cash flows from operating activities to fund its research and development, commercial programs and meet its obligations on a timely basis through the foreseeable future. As such, these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts and the classification of liabilities that might be necessary from the outcome of this uncertainty.       5      ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016      ADMA's long-term liquidity will be dependent upon on its ability to raise additional capital, to fund its research and development and commercial programs and meet its obligations on a timely basis. If ADMA is unable to successfully raise sufficient additional capital, it will likely not have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund its business operations, forcing ADMA to curtail activities and potentially significantly reduce, or potentially cease, operations. Even if ADMA is able to raise additional capital, such financings may only be available on unattractive terms, resulting in significant dilution of stockholders' interests and, in such event, the value and potential future market price of its common stock may decline.     There can be no assurance that the Company's research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable. The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, dependence on collaborative arrangements, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with FDA and other governmental regulations and approval requirements.      2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation     The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADMA and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, ADMA Plasma Biologics, Inc. and ADMA BioCenters. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.     The condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) which in the opinion of management are necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of March 31, 2017 and their results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, changes in stockholders' deficiency for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim periods or for the full year. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2016 on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 24, 2017. The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016, was derived from the 2016 audited consolidated financial statements.       6       ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016     The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim reporting. Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in complete annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted.     Inventories     Plasma inventories (both plasma intended for resale and plasma intended for internal use in the Company's research and development and future anticipated commercialization activities of which certain quantities are labeled as normal source and Respiratory Syncytial Virus ("RSV"), high titer) are carried at the lower of cost or market value determined by the first-in, first-out method. Research and development plasma used in clinical trials was processed to a finished product and subsequently expensed to research and development. Inventory at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 consists of high titer RSV plasma and normal source plasma.     Revenue recognition     Depending on the agreement with the customer, product revenues from the sale of human plasma collected at the Company's plasma collection centers are recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which occurs at the time of shipment. Product revenues are recognized at the time of delivery if the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, two of the Company's customers, SK Plasma Co., Ltd. ("SK") and BPC, represented 98% of the Company's total revenues, with BPC representing approximately 81% of the Company's total revenues and SK representing approximately 17% of the Company's total revenues.     Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement have been completed.     Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are comprised of product revenues from the sale of normal source human plasma collected from the Company's plasma collection centers segment and license and other revenues are primarily attributable to the out-licensing of RI-002 to Biotest to market and sell in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East. Biotest and BPC, a subsidiary of Biotest, have provided the Company with certain services and financial payments in accordance with the related Biotest license agreement and is obligated to pay the Company certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are achieved. Deferred revenue is recognized over the term of the Biotest license. Deferred revenue is amortized into income for a period of approximately 20 years, the term of the Biotest license agreement.     Use of estimates     The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include valuation of inventory, assumptions used in the fair value determination of stock-based compensation, warrants and the allowance for the valuation of future tax benefits.     Loss per common share     Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.       7       ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016     Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, if any, by the weighted average number of common stock and dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. Potential common stock includes the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method). Potential common stock in the diluted net loss per share computation is excluded to the extent that it would be anti-dilutive. No potentially dilutive securities are included in the computation of any diluted per share amounts as the Company reported a net loss for all periods presented. The aggregate number of potentially dilutive securities upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options was 1.9 million and 1.8 million as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.     Stock-based compensation     The Company follows recognized accounting guidance which requires all stock-based payments, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense, based on their fair values on the grant date. The estimated fair value of stock options granted under the Company's 2007 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "2007 Plan") and the Company's 2014 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2014 Plan") is recognized as compensation expense over the option-vesting period.     During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company granted stock options to purchase 182,000 and 85,984 shares of common stock, respectively, to its directors and employees.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements     In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations   Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The standard introduces a screen for determining when assets acquired are not a business and clarifies that a business must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that contribute to an output to be considered a business. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.     In March 2016, the FASB, issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718), which provides for simplification of certain aspects of employee share-based payment accounting including income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2017.     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on their balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires modified retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the standard may have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.     In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 , Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which includes amendments that require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       8       ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016     In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments , which includes amendments that require an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the changes  to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company adopted this standard and evaluated the impact the standard may have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.     In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . The standard requires entities to measure most inventory "at the lower of cost and net realizable value," thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures, one of which is net realizable value). The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2017.     In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable). Further, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is "substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern." The FASB believes that requiring management to perform the assessment will enhance the timeliness, clarity, and consistency of related disclosures and improve convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") (which emphasize management's responsibility for performing the going-concern assessment). However, the time horizon for the assessment (look-forward period) and the disclosure thresholds under GAAP and IFRSs will continue to differ. The Company adopted this standard as of December 31, 2016 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2017.     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires that an entity recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to its customers. In order to achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This update will replace existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP, when it becomes effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. The updated standard will permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update on its condensed consolidated financial statements.       9       ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO (Unaudited) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016      3. DEBT     Loan and Security Agreement     On June 19, 2015, the Company entered into an LSA with Oxford for up to $21.0 million of debt financing in two term loan tranches. The first term loan tranche of $16.0 million from the LSA (the "Term A Loan") was primarily used to repay the Company's previous debt facility with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. dated December 2012.     The outstanding term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.80% and (ii) the sum of (a) the three-month U.S. LIBOR rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal ) on the date occurring on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 7.54% on the outstanding principal balance. The effective interest rate for the loan tranche of $16.0 million, including backend fees is 11.40%. The Company began repaying the principal balance on February 1, 2017 for a period of 36 months, unless accelerated as a result of certain events of default. A final payment equal to 8.95% of the funded loan amount is due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. All term loans mature no later than January 1, 2020. The loans are secured by the Company's assets, except for its intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). The LSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including limitations on incurring indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions and making investments, distributions or transfers.     In connection with the entry into the LSA, on June 19, 2015, the Company issued to Oxford a seven-year warrant, expiring on June 19, 2022, to purchase 74,309 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $8.51 per share. The Company recorded $367,700 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan. The key assumptions used to value the warrants included: (i) volatility of 57% on the Company's common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of the Company' common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison; (ii) an expected dividend yield of 0.0%; (iii) a risk-free interest rate of 1.99%; and (iv) a term of seven years.     In May 2016, the Company amended the LSA with Oxford (the "Amended LSA") which provided ADMA with an additional $4.0 million term loan (the "Term B Loan"), the availability of which was conditioned on completing an equity financing of its common stock of at least $10.0 million in gross proceeds no later than May 31, 2016. On May 3, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million and subsequently borrowed the additional $4.0 million from Oxford under the Amended LSA, which brings the total principal amount borrowed to $20.0 million. The effective interest rate for the loan tranche of $4.0 million, including backend fees is 13.04%.     In the event the Company prepays a term loan for any reason, the Company is obligated to pay a prepayment charge corresponding to a percentage of the principal amount of the applicable term loan prepaid. The Amended LSA further modified the fees payable by the Company on mandatory or voluntary prepayment of a term loan prior to its maturity date as follows: (i) for a prepayment made on or after the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the first anniversary of its funding date, an amount equal to 3.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid; (ii) for a prepayment made after the first anniversary of the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the second anniversary of such funding date, an amount equal to 2.00% of the principal amount of such term loan prepaid; and (iii) for a prepayment of a term loan made after the second anniversary of its funding date and prior to its maturity date, an amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid.     Pursuant to the Amended LSA, (i) the Company paid a total facility fee of $125,000, consisting of $105,000 previously paid and an additional $20,000 paid on the date the Term B Loan was funded; (ii) certain adjustments were made to the time periods for any applicable prepayment fees; and (iii) certain defined terms were adjusted, including a new February 1, 2017 amortization date. The Amended LSA further provides for customary representations, warranties and covenants for the Company. Except as otherwise amended, the Amended LSA does not alter the terms of the LSA.       10       ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016     In connection with the Amended LSA, on May 13, 2016, the Company issued to Oxford a seven-year warrant, expiring on May 13, 2023, to purchase 24,800 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.37 per share, equal to 3.95% of the amount drawn of such tranche, divided by the average reported closing price per share of common stock for the consecutive 10 trading days prior to the applicable draw in accordance with the Company's drawdown of the Term B Loan. The Company recorded $86,300 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan. The key assumptions used to value the warrants included: volatility of 53.5% on the Company's common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of the Company's common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 1.51% and a term of seven years.     A summary of the Oxford loan balance is as follows:             4. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY     On May 3, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 2,176,154 shares of its common stock, for gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $13.0 million, after payment of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million. The shares were sold under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200638) that was declared effective by the SEC on December 23, 2014.     Oxford Debt Financing Warrant Issuance     In May 2016, the Company issued to Oxford warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 24,800 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal to $6.37 per share. The warrants became exercisable on May 13, 2016 for cash or by net exercise and will expire seven years after their issuance on May 13, 2023.     Equity incentive plan     The fair value of employee options granted was determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. The Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Because there has been minimal data for the Company's stock and very little historical experience with the Company's stock options, similar public companies and a pro rata percentage of the Company's common stock were used for calculating ADMA's volatility for comparison and expectations as to the assumptions required for fair value computation using the Black-Scholes methodology.       11       ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016           The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options outstanding and expected to vest at March 31, 2017 is 6.5 years. The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options exercisable at March 31, 2017 is 5.6 years.     A summary of the Company's option activity under the 2007 Plan and 2014 Plan and related information is as follows:           Stock-based compensation expense for the three ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:           As of March 31, 2017, the total compensation expense related to unvested options not yet recognized totaled $1,832,351. The weighted average vesting period over which the total compensation expense will be recorded related to unvested options not yet recognized at March 31, 2017 was approximately 2.3 years.      5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS     The Company leases an office building and equipment from Areth, LLC ("Areth") pursuant to a shared services agreement on a month-to-month basis of which terms were amended by the Company's Board of Directors in June 2016. Rent expense amounted to $48,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $24,112 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Areth is a company controlled by Dr. Jerrold B.

Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     This discussion, which refers to our historical results, should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this quarterly report, including "Risk Factors" and the consolidated financial statements and other consolidated financial information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The various sections of this discussion contain a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Our actual results may differ materially.     Overview     We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and intends to commercialize specialty plasma-based biologics for the proposed treatment of immune deficiencies and prevention of certain infectious diseases. Our targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disorder or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. Our product candidates are intended to be used by physician specialists focused on caring for immune-compromised patients with or at risk for certain infectious diseases.     Our Lead Product Candidate   RI-002     We are currently developing our lead product candidate, RI-002, for the treatment of PIDD, and have completed a pivotal Phase III clinical study. RI-002 is derived from human plasma blended from normal donors and donors tested to have high levels of neutralizing titers to RSV. RI-002 is manufactured using a process called fractionation, which purifies immune globulins, or IgG, from this blended plasma pool resulting in a final Intravenous Immune Globulin, or IVIG, product enriched with naturally occurring polyclonal anti-pathogen antibodies (e.g., streptococcus pneumonia, H. influenza type B, Cytomegalovirus or CMV, measles, tetanus, etc.). We use our proprietary RSV microneutralization assay to test for standardized levels of neutralizing antibodies to RSV in the final drug product.     In the third quarter of 2015, the FDA accepted for review our BLA for RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD. In July 2016, the FDA issued a CRL. The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety or efficacy data for RI-002 submitted in the BLA, nor did the FDA request any additional clinical studies be completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002. The FDA identified in the CRL, among other things, certain outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies relating to Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC, at our third-party contract manufacturers and vendors and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues. The FDA indicated in the CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things, these deficiencies are resolved. Since receiving the CRL, we have worked diligently with our contract fill and finisher as well as the contract testing laboratory. We have also continued to work with our third-party contract manufacturer, BPC, or Seller, and on January 23, 2017 we announced the signing of a definitive acquisition agreement to acquire certain manufacturing and therapy-related assets from BPC in Boca Raton, Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biotest Aktiengesellschaft, or Biotest, in efforts to address the CRL and remediate the outstanding warning letter and other matters at the manufacturing facility.     We continue to collaborate with our third-party manufacturers and vendors to identify solutions to outstanding issues identified in the CRL. We are currently preparing documentation for an additional submission to the FDA to address the CRL. We, along with our vendors, are awaiting certain feedback from the FDA regarding previous submissions and we intend to provide a timeline for resubmission of our BLA for RI-002 as soon as practicable. If RI-002 is approved by the FDA for PIDD, we intend to commercialize RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD and explore alternative processes to evaluate and seek approval for RI-002 for additional indications, patient populations and uses.     Evaluation of PIDD Patients     PIDD, a genetic disorder that causes a deficient or absent immune system, is caused by hereditary or genetic defects and can affect anyone regardless of age or gender. PIDD patients are more vulnerable to infections and more likely to suffer complications from these infections. IVIG is a plasma derived product that is used to prevent serious infections in patients with PIDD. It is comprised of polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins produced by B-cells that are used by the body's immune system to neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses. It is estimated that there are about 250,000 diagnosed PIDD patients in the U.S., approximately half of whom are treated with IVIG regularly. In the U.S., sales of immune globulin products for all its uses were reported to be approximately $4.8 billion in 2014.       16       The RI-002 pivotal Phase III clinical trial was conducted as a single arm study in which patients were treated approximately once per month for a period of 12 months plus 90 days for follow up. Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in nine treatment centers in the U.S. The pivotal Phase III primary endpoint followed published FDA industry guidance, which provides for a reduction in the incidence of serious infections to less than one per year in each subject receiving IVIG. The secondary outcome was safety and included other pharmacokinetic, or PK, data collection points including antibody titers for certain agents, including RSV antibody levels at various time points after infusion.     RI-002 demonstrated positive results in the Phase III study in patients with PIDD, meeting its primary endpoint, of no Serious Bacterial Infections, or SBI, reported. RI-002 was administered a total of 793 infusions with zero serious adverse events to 59 patients in nine treatment centers throughout the U.S. These results, included in the BLA, more than meet the requirement specified by FDA guidance of   1 SBI per patient-year.      On February 22, 2015, at the 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology Annual Meeting, scientific investigators reported on the secondary outcomes that included: a total of 93 days, or 1.66 days per patient per year lost from work or school due to infection; one hospitalization due to an infection of only five days duration in the entire study and IgG trough levels above those required by the FDA for IVIG products. Additionally, there was a marked increase in all of the measured specific anti-pathogen antibodies in PK subjects (n=31). The mean of maximum fold increases in specific antibody levels after infusion of RI-002 ranged from 1.9 fold (S. pneumonia type 19A) to 5.3 fold (RSV), which were statistically significant fold increases from the pathogen's specific measured baselines. The safety profile of RI-002 is comparable to that of other immunoglobulins.     Rationale for the Potential Evaluation in RSV Infected Patients     RSV is a common virus that ordinarily leads to mild, cold-like symptoms in healthy adults and children. In high-risk groups, such as the PIDD population and the other immune-compromised populations, RSV can lead to a more serious infection and may even cause death. The polyclonal antibodies which are present in RI-002 are expected to prevent infections in immune-compromised patients.     We previously conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to evaluate RI-001, RI-002's predecessor product candidate, in immune-compromised, RSV-infected patients. This trial was conducted with 21 patients in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Phase II dose-ranging trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline RSV titers to day 18 in the high dose and low dose treatment groups when compared with placebo (p=0.0043 and p=0.0268, respectively). The mean fold increase for high dose was 9.24 (95% CI 4.07, 21.02) and the observed mean fold increase for low dose was 4.85 (95% CI 2.22, 10.59). The mean fold change for placebo treated patients was 1.42 (95% CI 0.64, 3.17). In addition, more patients in the high dose (85.7%) and low dose (42.9%) groups experienced greater than a four-fold increase from baseline to day 18 in RSV titer levels compared to placebo (0%). There were no serious drug-related adverse events reported during the trial.     From April 2009 through February 2011, RI-001 was also administered to 15 compassionate use patients where physicians requested access to the product for treating their patients with documented lower respiratory tract RSV infections due to the fact that these patients had failed conventional therapeutic interventions. Serum samples were obtained from 13 patients. Samples showed that patients demonstrated a four-fold or greater rise in RSV antibody titers from baseline. Serum samples were not obtained from two patients that received Palivizumab. All 11 patients who received RI-001 within 4.2 days after the onset of the diagnosis of RSV survived. The drug was well-tolerated in all 15 patients and there were no reports of serious adverse events attributable to RI-001. Data from our Phase II clinical trial, compassionate use experience and data obtained from the evaluation of RI-002 in the infected cotton rat animal model has been presented at various conferences during 2014, 2015 and 2016.       17       Based on these results, we intend to evaluate RI-002 for the treatment of RSV patients following FDA approval, if received, for treatment of PIDD.     Commercialization     While we are working towards remediating the warning letter and other deficiencies and eventually refiling the BLA resubmission for RI-002, we expect to continue our commercialization efforts and plan to increase our initiatives by hiring a small, specialty sales force to market Nabi-HB  (Hepatitis B Immune Globulin, Human) upon closing the Proposed Acquisition anticipated in June 2017, and Bivigam  (Immune Globulin Intravenous, Human) upon its relaunch and RI-002 once approved by the FDA, to hospitals, physician offices/clinics, and other specialty treatment organizations. We anticipate staffing our company with additional personnel for patient support, medical affairs, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, scientific affairs, reimbursement, inventory and logistics, human resources, and financial and operational management. If and when we receive FDA approval, we may also use a network of national distributors to assist with order fulfillment for RI-002 for use by healthcare professionals and hospitals.     Intellectual Property     During the second quarter of 2015, we received a notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent Office, or USPTO, for our RI-002 patent filed under U.S. patent application 14/592,721 entitled 'Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Immunodeficiency,' which extends through January 2035. During the third quarter of 2015, our U.S. Patent 9,107,906 was issued by the USPTO. This patent describes methods by which the blending of plasma obtained from normal donors with plasma obtained from donors selected to have high levels of neutralizing titers to RSV form a unique antibody enriched plasma pool and provide for the standardization of the levels of anti-RSV antibodies in the RI-002 final product. Our proprietary microneutralization assay allows us to effectively identify and isolate donor plasma with high-titer RSV antibodies and to standardize RI-002's antibody profile, which we believe may enable us to garner a premium price.     Plasma Collection Facilities     Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA Bio Centers Georgia, Inc., or ADMA BioCenters, operates two FDA-licensed, German Health Authority, or GHA, and Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MFDS, certified source plasma collection facilities located in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia, which provide us with a portion of our blood plasma for the manufacture of RI-002. A typical plasma collection center, such as those operated by ADMA BioCenters, can collect approximately 30,000 to 50,000 liters of source plasma annually, which may be sold for different prices depending upon the type of plasma, quantity of purchase, and market conditions at the time of sale. Plasma collected from ADMA BioCenters' two Georgia facilities that is not used for making RI-002 is sold to third-party customers in the U.S., and other locations where we are approved globally under supply agreements or in the open &quot;spot&quot; market. We have entered into long-term manufacturing and licensing agreements with Biotest and their U.S. subsidiary, BPC, that provide for the exclusive manufacture of RI-002. At the same time, we granted Biotest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to market and sell RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in Europe and in other selected territories in North Africa and the Middle East.     Financial Operations Overview     Revenues     Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are comprised of product revenues from the sale of normal source human plasma collected from our plasma collection centers segment and license and other revenues which are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized into income over the terms of the respective agreements. In exchange for the out-licensing of RI-002 to market and sell in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East, BPC has provided us with certain services and a financial payment received in accordance with the related license agreement and is obligated to pay us certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are achieved.       18       A significant amount of our revenues are attributed to a single customer, BPC. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, two of our customers, SK Plasma Co., Ltd., or SK, and BPC, represented 98% of our total revenues, with BPC representing approximately 81% of our total revenues and SK representing approximately 17% of our total revenues. Product revenues from the sale of human plasma collected at our FDA-licensed plasma collection centers are recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which occurs, depending on the agreement with the customer, at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery if we retain the risk of loss during shipment. Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement have been completed.     Research and Development Expenses     Research and development, or R&amp;D, expenses, attributable to our R&amp;D segment, consists of clinical research organization costs, clinical trial costs related to our clinical trial, consulting expenses relating to regulatory and medical affairs, quality assurance and control, manufacturing, assay development, ongoing testing costs, drug product manufacturing including the cost of plasma, plasma storage and transportation costs, as well as wages and benefits for employees, including stock-based compensation directly related to the R&amp;D of RI-002. All R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred.     The process of conducting preclinical studies, clinical trials and regulatory activities necessary to obtain FDA approval is costly and time consuming. The probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the quality of the product candidate's early clinical data, investment in the program, competition, regulatory, manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, the uncertainties associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, R&amp;D expenses decreased as compared to R&amp;D expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016 due to lower validation, testing and production costs related to RI-002. We anticipate that 2017 R&amp;D expenses will continue to decrease, as compared to 2016, as a result of reduced testing and validation services related to RI-002 offset by increased costs related to regulatory activities in connection with the CRL. Once we have clarity for the timing of our expected BLA resubmission and anticipated RI-002 approval, we would then expect our R&amp;D costs to increase.     General and Administrative Expenses     General and administrative, or G&amp;A, expenses, consist of Proposed Acquisition fees, wages, stock-based compensation, benefits for senior management and staff unrelated to R&amp;D, legal fees, accounting and auditing fees, commercialization and marketing activities, information technology, investor relations fees, rent, maintenance and utilities, insurance, travel and other expenses related to the general operations of our business. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, G&amp;A expenses primarily increased as a result of fees incurred for the Proposed Acquisition, fees paid for legal, accounting, and financial advisory fees related to the issuance of a fairness opinion and due diligence fees. We expect that our G&amp;A expenses will decrease as we continue to manage our costs through deferring certain pre-launch and commercial planning activities, while we focus on addressing the CRL. Once we have clarity for the timing of our expected BLA resubmission and anticipated RI-002 approval, we would then expect our G&amp;A costs to increase.     Other Income and Expense     Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest expense consists of interest incurred on our notes payable, as well as the amortization of end of term fees, back end fees, value of warrants issued, facility and financing fees. We anticipate other income and expense to remain consistent throughout 2017 as a result of our current outstanding debt and interest earned on investments.       19       Results of Operations     Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016     Summary table     The following table presents a summary of the changes in our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016:           Revenues     We recorded total revenues of $2,628,871 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $2,123,886 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Product revenue was $2,593,163 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which is attributable to our ADMA BioCenters plasma collection centers segment and derived from the sale of human source plasma collected in our FDA-licensed, GHA and MFDS-certified Georgia-based blood plasma collection centers, compared to product revenue of $2,088,178 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in product revenue of $504,985 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to increased sales generated from our plasma supply agreement with SK, under which SK purchases normal source plasma from ADMA BioCenters. The normal source plasma and high-titer RSV plasma which we did not sell was allocated to inventory in anticipation of commercial manufacturing. For each of the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, license and other revenue was $35,708, which relates to services and financial payments provided by BPC and Biotest in accordance with our license agreement. We have not generated any revenue from our therapeutics research and development business.     Cost of Product Revenue     Cost of product revenue was $1,616,287 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and $1,266,421 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in cost of product revenue of $349,866 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was directly related to the increase in product revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2016.     Research and Development Expenses     R&amp;D expenses, which are attributable to our R&amp;D segment, were $1,192,727 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $834,985 as compared to $2,027,712 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. R&amp;D expenses consist of clinical research organization costs, consulting expenses relating to regulatory affairs, quality control and manufacturing, assay development and ongoing testing costs, clinical trial costs and fees, drug product manufacturing, including the cost of plasma, plasma storage and transportation costs, as well as wages and benefits for staff directly related to the research and development of RI-002. R&amp;D expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily as a result of lower validation, testing and production costs related to RI-002 due to receipt of the CRL from the FDA during the third quarter of 2016.       20       Plasma Center Operating Expenses     Plasma center operating expenses were $1,479,476 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $199,057 as compared to $1,280,419 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Plasma center operating expenses consist of: general and administrative plasma center costs; overhead comprised of rent, maintenance, utilities, wages, stock-based compensation and benefits for center staff, plasma collection supplies, plasma transportation and storage (off-site); advertising and promotion expenses; and computer software fees related to donor collections. The increase in plasma center expenses is attributable to hiring additional staff and increasing the hours of operations at our Marietta, Georgia location during the first quarter of 2017. We expect that as plasma collection increases, our operating expenses will also increase accordingly.     General and Administrative Expenses     G&amp;A expenses were $4,277,384 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $2,569,514 from $1,707,870 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. G&amp;A expenses consist of Proposed Acquisition fees, wages and stock-based compensation for our senior management and staff unrelated to research and development, professional fees for commercialization and marketing consulting, attorneys, accountants and auditors, investor relations, maintenance and utilities, insurance, information technology, travel and other expenses related to the general operations of the business. G&amp;A expenses primarily increased as a result of fees incurred for the Proposed Acquisition, fees paid for legal, accounting, financial advisory fees related to the issuance of a fairness opinion and due diligence fees.     Total Operating Expenses     Total operating expenses were $8,565,874 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $2,283,452 from $6,282,422 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in G&amp;A expenses.     Other Income (Expense); Interest Expense     Other expense, net, was $599,960 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $453,933 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase of $146,027 is primarily related to increased interest expense due to an increase of $4,000,000 to our current debt in the second quarter of 2016, which includes debt discounts amortization for our new lender's end of term fees, back end fees, value of warrants issued, facility and financing fees.     Net Loss     Net loss was $6,536,963 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $1,924,494 from $4,612,469 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the increase in G&amp;A expenses.     Cash Flows     Net Cash Used in Operating Activities     Net cash used in operating activities was $5,398,426 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The net loss for this period was higher than net cash used in operating activities by $1,138,537, which was primarily attributable to an increase in prepaid expenses of $432,932 for vendor payments related to insurance premiums, increased inventories of $288,346 related to collection and purchases of normal source and RSV plasma, an increase in accounts payable of $1,339,764 primarily related to legal, accounting and due diligence fees associated with the Proposed Acquisition, offset by decreases in accounts receivable of $178,089 and accrued expenses of $160,637. Net loss also included non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation of $235,877, amortization of debt discount of $190,253 and depreciation and amortization of $118,062.       21       Net cash used in operating activities was $5,167,930 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The net loss for this period was lower than net cash used in operating activities by $555,461, which was primarily attributable to an increase in prepaid expenses of $633,883 for vendor payments related to insurance premiums, prepayments to third party manufacturing vendors for commercial manufacturing of RI-002, increased inventories of $603,466 related to allocating additional plasma to inventory in preparation for commercial manufacturing activities anticipated in 2016, an increase in accounts payable of $377,061 offset by a decrease in accrued expenses of $306,462. Net loss also included non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation of $422,180, and depreciation and amortization of $251,940.     Net Cash Used in Investing Activities     Net cash used in investing activities was $5,141,600 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which was related to the redemptions of short-term investments of $5,145,184 and $3,584 in purchases of computers and equipment.     Net cash provided by investing activities was $3,655,762 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, which was related to the maturity of short-term investments of $3,673,199 and $17,437 in purchases of computers and equipment.     Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities     Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,115,113 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which primarily consisted of repayments on the principal balance for our Loan and Security Agreement, or LSA, with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, which the Company became obligated to begin repaying over 36 months beginning February 1, 2017.     Net cash used in financing activities totaled $3,659 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, for payments on our leasehold improvement loan for ADMA BioCenters.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     Overview     As of March 31, 2017, we had working capital of $2.7 million, consisting primarily of $8.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $0.3 million of short term investments, $0.8 million of accounts receivable, $5.3 million of inventories and $0.7 million of prepaid expenses, offset primarily by the current portion of the note payable due to Oxford of $6.7 million, $3.9 million of accounts payable, $2.2 million of accrued expenses and $0.1 million of deferred revenue.     We have had limited revenue from operations and we have incurred cumulative losses of $113.5 million since inception. We have funded our operations to date primarily from equity investments, loans from venture debt lenders and loans from our primary stockholders. In May 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock and we received net proceeds of approximately $12.9 million. In May 2016, we amended our LSA with Oxford and borrowed an additional $4.0 million. In March 2015, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $10.2 million from an underwritten public offering from the sale of our common stock. Our funds are being used and have been used: to conduct clinical trials; to manufacture drug products; to collect and procure plasma; to test plasma donors for RSV titers; to file our BLA for RI-002; to conduct pre-launch activities; for commercialization and marketing activities; for the buildout and expansion of our plasma centers; for expenses related to our Proposed Acquisition of certain assets of BPC and the remainder for payment of existing accounts payable; for general and administrative, research and development expenses; and for other business activities and general corporate purposes.       22       Future Financing Needs     We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on product development, quality and regulatory activities pre-launch and commercialization, procuring raw material plasma, manufacturing, conducting potential future clinical trials for our product candidates and purchasing clinical trial materials from our suppliers. We anticipate that, based upon our projected revenue and expenditures, our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable will be sufficient to fund our operations into the second half of 2017. In June 2017, we anticipate closing the Proposed Acquisition with BPC, at which time BPC will provide us with funds consisting of: $12.5 million in funding, $15.0 million in debt financing and an additional $12.5 million commitment towards a future equity financing, which funds are expected to be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of 2018. In order to have sufficient cash to fund our operations thereafter and to continue as a going concern, we will need to raise additional equity or debt capital by the end of the first quarter of 2018, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in doing so. Other than the funding to be provided by BPC upon closing the Proposed Acquisition, we currently do not have arrangements to obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully close the Proposed Acquisition. This time frame may change based upon the timing of our closing of the Proposed Acquisition, the quality management systems' remediation plans for the BPC operations, commercial manufacturing scale up activities, how aggressively we execute on our commercial initiatives and the resubmission of our BLA for RI-002 and when the FDA approves our BLA for RI-002, if at all. We currently do not have arrangements to obtain additional financing. Any such financing could be difficult to obtain or only available on unattractive terms and could result in significant dilution of stockholders' interests. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business plan and financial performance and we could be forced to delay, discontinue or prevent product development, clinical trial or commercialization activities, delay or discontinue the approval of any of our potential products, or potentially cease operations. In addition, we could be forced to reduce or forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities.     Furthermore, if our assumptions underlying our estimated expenses are incorrect, we may have to raise additional capital sooner than anticipated. Because of numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research and development and potential future commercialization of our product candidate, we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our anticipated clinical trials and development activities. Our current estimates may be subject to change as circumstances regarding our business requirements evolve. We may decide to raise capital through public or private equity offerings, such financings may only be available on unattractive terms, resulting in significant dilution of stockholders' interests and, in such event, the value and potential future market price of our common stock may decline, or we may decide to obtain debt financings or a bank credit facility or to enter into corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if convertible, could result in dilution to our current stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations or other future financing alternatives. Additional equity or debt financing, grants, or corporate collaboration and potential licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.     If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our planned clinical trials and delay or abandon potential commercialization efforts of our lead product candidate or other product candidates.      Our long-term liquidity depends on our ability to raise additional capital, to fund our research and development and commercial programs and meet our obligations on a timely basis. We have reported losses since inception in June 2004 through March 31, 2017, and we have as of March 31, 2017, an accumulated deficit of $113.5 million. We believe that we will continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities to fund our research and development, commercial programs and meet our obligations on a timely basis through the foreseeable future. As such, these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to successfully raise sufficient additional capital, we will likely not have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund our business operations as we currently operate, which may force us to delay, discontinue or prevent product development and clinical trial activities or the approval of any of our potential products, curtail our activities and potentially significantly reduce, or potentially cease operations.       23       Financial markets in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia continue to experience disruption, including, among other things, significant volatility in security prices, declining valuations of certain investments, as well as severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions continues to be greatly reduced and local governments and many businesses are still suffering from the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. Instability in the credit and financial market conditions may negatively impact our ability to access capital and credit markets and our ability to manage our cash balance. While we are unable to predict the continued duration and severity of the adverse conditions in the U.S. and other countries, any of the circumstances mentioned above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows or cash position.     Effect of Inflation     Inflation did not have a significant impact on our net sales, revenues or income from continuing operations in 2014, 2015 or 2016, or for the three months ended March 31, 2017.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements     In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations   Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The standard introduces a screen for determining when assets acquired are not a business and clarifies that a business must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that contribute to an output to be considered a business. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718), which provides for simplification of certain aspects of employee share-based payment accounting including income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017 and will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition approach depending on the area covered in this update. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures during the first quarter of 2017.     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on their balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires modified retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. We are currently evaluating the impact the standard may have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.     In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 , Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which includes amendments that require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       24       In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments , which includes amendments that require an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the changes  to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. We adopted this standard and evaluated the impact the standard may have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.     In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . The standard requires entities to measure most inventory "at the lower of cost and net realizable value," thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures, one of which is net realizable value). The standard is effective for us prospectively beginning January 1, 2017. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements during the first quarter of 2017.     In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable). Further, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is "substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern." The FASB believes that requiring management to perform the assessment will enhance the timeliness, clarity, and consistency of related disclosures and improve convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS (which emphasize management's responsibility for performing the going-concern assessment). However, the time horizon for the assessment (look-forward period) and the disclosure thresholds under Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the U.S. of America, or GAAP, and IFRS will continue to differ. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard as of December 31, 2016 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements during the first quarter of 2017.     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires that an entity recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to its customers. In order to achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This update will replace existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP, when it becomes effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. The updated standard will permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact of this update on our condensed consolidated financial statements.       25       Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We could be an emerging growth company until December 31, 2018, which is the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a "large accelerated filer," our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. As an "emerging growth company," we may, under Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We may take advantage of this extended transition period until the first to occur of the date that we (i) are no longer an "emerging growth company" or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this extended transition period. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our condensed consolidated financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Until the date that we are no longer an "emerging growth company" or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B), upon issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to our condensed consolidated financial statements and that has a different effective date for public and private companies, we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for non-emerging growth companies and the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard. As an emerging growth company, we are also exempt from the requirement to have our independent auditors provide an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.     This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and assumptions, including those described below. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates.     Some of the estimates and assumptions we have to make under GAAP require difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the estimation processes involved, the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.     Stock-Based Compensation     Stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period on a straight-line basis.     We account for stock options granted to non-employees on a fair value basis using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. The noncash charge to operations for non-employee options with vesting is revalued at the end of each reporting period based upon the change in the fair value of the options and amortized to consulting expense over the related contract service period.     For purposes of valuing stock options granted to our employees, non-employees and directors and officers through the three months ended March 31, 2017, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We granted options to purchase an aggregate of 182,000 shares of common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2017. To determine the risk-free interest rate, we utilized the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant with a term consistent with the expected term of our awards. The expected term of the options granted is in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletins 107 and 110, which is based on the average between vesting terms and contractual terms. The expected dividend yield reflects our current and expected future policy for dividends on our common stock. The expected stock price volatility for our stock options was calculated by examining the pro rata historical volatilities for similar publicly traded industry peers and the trading history for our common stock. We will continue to analyze the expected stock price volatility and expected term assumptions.       26       Research and Development Costs     Our R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred, including costs associated with (i) planning and conducting clinical trials, (ii) drug product manufacturing, including the cost of plasma, plasma storage and transportation costs; (iii) quality testing, validation, regulatory consulting and filing fees; and (iv) employees' compensation expenses directly related to R&amp;D activities.     Revenue Recognition     Depending on the agreement with the customer, revenue from the sale of human plasma collected by ADMA BioCenters is recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which usually occurs at the time of shipment. Product revenue is recognized at the time of delivery if we retain the risk of loss during shipment. Our product revenues are substantially attributable to two customers. One customer accounts for greater than 80% and another customer accounts for greater than 15% of our product revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement with Biotest have been completed.     Accounting for Loan and Security Agreement     On June 19, 2015, we entered into a LSA with Oxford for up to $21.0 million and refinanced our then existing debt. The first tranche of $16.0 million from the Oxford loan was primarily used to repay our existing debt and the remaining $5.0 million was available at our option upon RI-002's BLA being approved from the FDA no later than January 31, 2017, which funding would have also extended our interest only period for an additional six months pursuant to the May 2016 amendment to the LSA. The LSA bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.80% and (ii) the sum of (a) the three month U.S. LIBOR rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal ) on the date occurring on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 7.54% on the outstanding principal balance. We began repaying the principal balance on February 1, 2017 for a period of 36 months, unless accelerated as a result of certain events of default. A final payment equal to 8.95% of the funded loan amount is due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. In the event of the six-month interest only extension, the final payment will be 9.95% of the funded loan, which shall also be due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. In the event we elect to prepay the loan, we are obligated to pay a prepayment charge corresponding to a percentage of the principal amount of the loan, with such percentage being: (i) for a prepayment made on or after the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the first anniversary of its funding date, an amount equal to 3.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid; (ii) for a prepayment made after the first anniversary of the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the second anniversary of such funding date, an amount equal to 2.00% of the principal amount of such term loan prepaid; and (iii) for a prepayment of a term loan made after the second anniversary of its funding date and prior to its maturity date, an amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid. All term loans mature no later than January 1, 2020. The loans are secured by our assets, except for our intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). The LSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including limitations on incurring indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions and making investments, distributions or transfers.     In connection with the LSA, on June 19, 2015, we issued to Oxford a seven-year warrant, expiring on June 19, 2022, to purchase 74,309 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $8.51 per share. We recorded $367,700 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan. The key assumptions used to value the warrants included: (i) volatility of 57% on our common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of our common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison; (ii) an expected dividend yield of 0.0%; (iii) a risk-free interest rate of 1.99%; and (iv) a term of seven years. As a result of prepaying our prior loan before maturity, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million comprised of debt issuance costs, debt discount related to the warrants issued to our prior lender, and a prepayment penalty.       27       In May 2016, we entered into an amendment to our LSA with Oxford, pursuant to which we borrowed an additional $4.0 million, as an extension to the original LSA entered into on June 19, 2015, which brings the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million. In connection therewith, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 24,800 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to $6.37, which will expire seven years after their issuance on May 13, 2023. We paid a total facility fee of $125,000, consisting of $105,000 previously paid and an additional $20,000 paid on the date the $4.0 million loan was funded.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     We have entered into leases for our ADMA BioCenters' facilities in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia. The Norcross, Georgia lease expires on September 30, 2023, and the Marietta, Georgia lease expires on January 31, 2024. There is a total minimum rent due under these leases of $4.8 million through the end of the lease terms.
