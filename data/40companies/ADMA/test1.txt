AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015          1.    ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS       ADMA Biologics, Inc. ("ADMA" or the "Company") is a late stage biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and intends to commercialize specialty plasma-based biologics for the treatment and prevention of certain infectious diseases. The Company's targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disease or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. ADMA also operates its wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA BioCenters Georgia, Inc., ("ADMA BioCenters"), a source plasma collection business with U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approved facilities in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia.Each facility holds certifications fromthe German Health Authority ("GHA") and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety ("MFDS").ADMA BioCenters provides ADMA with a portion of its raw material plasma for the manufacture of RI-002, ADMA's lead product candidate, which is intended for the treatment of Primary Immune Deficiency Disease, ("PIDD"). A Biologics License Application ("BLA") for RI-002 was submitted to the FDA and accepted for review during the third quarter of 2015.The Company's Marietta, Georgia center received FDA approval to sell human source plasma within the U.S. during the third quarter of 2015.    The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception in 2004 and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.Since inception, the Company has needed to raise capital from the sales of its equity securities and debt financings to sustain operations.    In October 2013, the Company completed an Initial Public Offering ("IPO") to raise gross proceeds of approximately $29.1 million.In March 2015, ADMA completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $11.3 million.In June 2015, ADMA entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the "LSA") with Oxford Finance LLC ("Oxford"), as collateral agent and lender, pursuant to which ADMA accessed an initial term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $16.0 million, of which approximately $15.7 million was used to repay a priorloan balance of approximately $15.0 million to Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. ("Hercules"), along with approximately $0.4 million of interest and approximately $0.3 million of prepayment premiumand other fees, under its prior loan and security agreement, dated December 21, 2012, with Hercules (the "Prior Loan Agreement"), as amended on February 24, 2014, (see Note 3).ADMA may elect to access an additional term loan under the LSA in the aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million if it receives approval of its BLA for RI-002 from the FDA on or before January 31, 2017, which funding would also extend its interest only period for an additional six months pursuant to the May 2016 amendment to the LSA.In May2016 the Company amended its LSA with Oxford.This amendment provided ADMA with an additional $4.0 million term loan, the availability of which was predicated on completing an equity financing of its common stock of at least $10.0 million in gross proceeds no later than May 31, 2016.In May 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million, (see Note 8 for additional details on the equity financing and loan amendment) and subsequently borrowed an additional $4.0 million from Oxford under the amended LSA, which brings the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million.    As of March 31, 2016, the Company had working capital of $13.1 million, consisting primarily of $8.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.7 million of short-term investments, $1.0 million of accounts receivable, $4.0 million of inventories, and $0.7 million of prepaid expenses, offset primarily by $2.4 million of accounts payable, $1.7 million of accrued expenses and $0.1 million of deferred revenue.Based upon the Company's projected revenue and expenditures for 2016 and 2017, including the ongoing implementation of the Company's commercialization and expansion activities, management currently believes that its cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable as of the date of this report are sufficient to fund ADMA's operations, as currently conducted, into the second half of 2017. Because the Company does not anticipate receiving FDA approval for RI-002earlier thanthe second half of 2016, if at all, the Company would not expect to generate revenue from the commercialization of RI-002 earlier than such time, if at all. Furthermore, if the Company's assumptions are incorrect underlying its estimated expenses, timing of FDA approval for RI-002, or estimated revenues for RI-002, it may have to raise additional capital sooner than anticipated.The Company has the option to borrow an additional $5.0 million through its current LSA with Oxford, based upon the Company receiving BLA approval by the FDA for RI-002 by January 31, 2017. Other than this additional $5.0 million, the Company does not have any existing commitments for future external funding.The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if convertible, could result in dilution to the Company's stockholders.The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict the Company's operations or other financing alternatives.Additional equity or debt financing, grants, or corporate collaboration and potential licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate the Company's research and development programs, reduce the Company's planned clinical trials and delay or abandon potential commercialization efforts of the Company's lead or other product candidates.The Company has reported losses since inception in June 2004 through March 31, 2016 of $92.0 million.Managementbelieves that the Company will continue to incur net losses and negative net cash flows from operating activities to fund its research and development, commercial programs and meet its obligations on a timely basis through the foreseeable future.ADMA's long-term liquidity will be dependent upon on its ability to obtain FDA approval for RI-002, generate sales of RI-002 and potentially raise additional capital, to fund its research and development and commercial programs and meet to its obligations on a timely basis, if at all.          5               ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015      There can be no assurance that the Company's research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable.The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, dependence on collaborative arrangements and third-party manufacturers, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with FDA and other governmental regulations and approval requirements.         2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation    The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADMA and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, ADMA Plasma Biologics, Inc. and ADMA BioCenters. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.    The condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) which in the opinion of management are necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2016 and its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim periods or for the full year.These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, (the "SEC") on March 23, 2016.           6                ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015      The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, ("GAAP"), in accordance with the rules and regulations of theSEC for interim reporting.Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in complete annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted.    Inventories    Plasma inventories (both plasma intended for resale and plasma intended for internal use intheCompany'sresearch and development and future anticipated commercialization activities) are carried at the lower of cost or market value determined on the first-in, first-out method.Research and development plasma used in clinical trials was processed to a finished product and subsequently expensed to research and development.Inventory at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consists of high titer plasma and normal source plasma.    Debt    In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset.Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 in its second quarter 2015 condensed consolidated financial statements and recast the prior period balances to conform to the current period presentation.    Revenue recognition    Depending on the agreement with the customer, revenues from the sale of human plasma collected at the Company's FDA licensed plasma collection centers are recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which occurs at the time of shipment.Revenue is recognized at the time of delivery if the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment.The Company's revenues are substantially attributable to one customer.Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations under the terms of the license agreement have been completed.    Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016 are comprised of product revenues from the sale of normal source human plasma collected from the Company's plasma collection centers segment and license and other revenues are primarily attributable to the out-licensing of RI-002 to Biotest AG to market and sell in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East.Biotest AG and Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Biotest, a subsidiary of Biotest AG, has provided the Company with certain financial payment and services in accordance with the related license agreement and is obligated to pay the Company certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are achieved.During the third quarter 2015, the Company recorded deferred revenue of $1.5 million for a milestone payment provided to the Company upon its filing of the BLA for RI-002 with the FDA, in accordance with the terms of the license agreement. Deferred revenue of $1.7 million was recorded in 2013 as a result of certain research and development services provided in accordance with the same license agreement. Deferred revenue is recognized over the term of the license.Deferred revenue is amortized into income for a period of approximately 20 years, the term of the license agreement.           7               ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015      Use of estimates    The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates.Significant estimates include valuation of inventory, assumptions used in the fair value determination of stock-based compensation, warrants and the allowance for the valuation of future tax benefits.    Loss per common share    Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.    Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, if any, by the weighted average number of common stock and dilutive common stock outstanding during the period.Potential common stock includes the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method).Potential common stock in the diluted net loss per share computation is excluded to the extent that it would be anti-dilutive.No potentially dilutive securities are included in the computation of any diluted per share amounts as the Company reported a net loss for all periods presented.The aggregate number of potentially dilutive securities upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options was 1.8 million and 1.5 million as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    Stock-based compensation    The Company follows recognized accounting guidance which requires all stock-based payments, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense, based on their fair values on the grant date. The estimated fair value of stock options granted under the Company's 2007 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "2007 Plan") and the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2014 Plan") is recognized as compensation expense over the option-vesting period.    During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company granted stock options to purchase 85,984 and 230,000 shares of common stock, respectively, to its directors and employees.        3.    DEBT       Loan and Security Agreement    On June 19, 2015, the Company entered into the LSA with Oxford for up to $21.0 million and refinanced its existing loan with Hercules.The first tranche of $16.0 million from the Oxford loan was primarily used to repay itsprevious facility with Hercules and the remaining $5.0 million is available at ADMA's option upon RI-002's BLA being approved from the FDA on or before January 31, 2017, which funding would also extend its interest only period for an additional six months pursuant to the May 2016 amendment to the LSA.The LSA bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.80% and (ii) the sum of (a) the three (3) month U.S. LIBOR rate (as reported in The Wall Street Journal) on the date occurring on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 7.54% on the outstanding principal balance.The Company is obligated to begin to repay the principal over 36 months beginning February 1, 2017, unless accelerated as a result of certain events of default. A final payment equal to 8.95% of the funded loan amount is due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment.In the event of the six-month interest only extension, the final payment will be 9.95% of the funded loan, which shall also be due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. In addition, a facility fee of $105,000 was paid at closing.In the event the Company prepaysa loan for any reason, the Company is obligated to pay a prepayment charge corresponding to a percentage of the principal amount of the applicableloan prepaid, with such percentage being: 3.0% if prepayment occurs through the first anniversary of itsfunding, 2.0% if prepayment occurs after the first anniversarythrough the second anniversary of the applicable funding date, and1.0% if prepayment occurs after the second anniversary ofits funding date and prior to itsmaturity date. The loan matures no later than January 1, 2020. The loan is secured by the Company's assets, except for its intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). The LSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including limitations on incurring indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions and making investments, distributions or transfers.The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the LSA were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of a specific date or specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the LSA. Events of default under the agreement include, but are not limited to: (i) insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar events; (ii) failure to pay any debts due under the LSA or other loan documents on a timely basis; (iii) failure to observe any covenant or secured obligation under the LSA or other loan documents, which failure, in most cases, is not cured within 10 days of written notice by lender; (iv) occurrence of any default under any other agreement between the Company and the lender, which is not cured within 10 days; (v) occurrence of an event that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect;(vi) material misrepresentations; (vii) occurrence of any default under any other agreement involving indebtedness or the occurrence of a default under any agreement that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect; and (viii) certain money judgments are entered against the Company or a certain portion of its assets are attached or seized.Remedies for events of default include acceleration of amounts owed under the LSA and taking immediate possession of, and selling, any collateral securing the loan.           8                ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015      In connection with the LSA, on June 19, 2015, the Company issued to Oxford a seven year warrant, expiring on June 19, 2022, to purchase 74,309 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $8.51 per share. The Company recorded $367,700 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan.The key assumptions used to value the warrants included: volatility of 57% on the Company's common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of the Company's common stock's volatility and similar public companies' volatilities for comparison, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 1.99% and a term of 7 years.As a result of prepaying the Hercules loan prior to maturity, the Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million comprised of unamortized debt issuance costs, unamortized debt discount related to the warrants issued to Hercules, along with a prepayment penalty.    In May2016, the Company amended its LSA with Oxford.This amendment provided ADMA with an additional $4.0 million term loan, the availability of which was predicated on completing an equity financing of its common stock of at least $10.0 million in gross proceeds no later than May 31, 2016.In May 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million, (see Note 8 for additional details on the equity financing and loan amendment) and subsequently borrowed an additional $4.0 millionfrom Oxford under the amended LSA, which brings the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million.           9                ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015       A summary of the Oxford loan balance as of March 31, 2016 is as follows:                 4.    STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY       On March 18, 2015, the Company announced the closing of an underwritten sale of 1,225,000 shares of its common stock, as well as 183,750 additional shares of its common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters thereof, for gross proceeds of approximately $11.3 million. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $10.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million. The shares were sold under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200638) that was declared effective by the SEC on December 23, 2014. In May 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million, (see Note 8 for additional details on the equity financing).    Equity incentive plan    The fair value of employee options granted was determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. The Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Because there has been minimal data for the Company's stock and very little historical experience with the Company's stock options, similar public companies and a pro rata percentage of the Company'scommon stock were used for calculating ADMA's volatility for comparison and expectations as to the assumptions required for fair value computation using the Black-Scholes methodology.            Guidance for stock-based compensation requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.The Company has not experienced any material forfeitures of stock options and, as such, has not established a forfeiture rate since the stock options currently outstanding are primarily held by its senior management and directors.The Company will continue to evaluate the effects of such future potential forfeitures, as they may arise, to evaluate its estimated forfeiture rate.    The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options outstanding and expected to vest at March 31, 2016 is 7.1 years.The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock options exercisable at March 31, 2016 is 6.1 years.           10               ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2016 AND 2015       A summary of the Company's option activity under the 2007 Plan and 2014 Plan and related information is as follows:            Stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:             As of March 31, 2016, the total compensation expense related to unvested options not yet recognized totaled $2,469,668. The weighted average vesting period over which the total compensation expense will be recorded related to unvested options not yet recognized at March 31, 2016 was approximately 2.7 years.         5.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS       The Company leases an office building and equipment from an entity owned by related parties on a month-to-month basis.Rent expense amounted to $24,112 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The Company also reimburses its landlord for office related expenses, equipment and certain other operational expenses, which have been insignificant to the consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.The Company maintains deposits and other accounts at a bank whichwas less than 5%-owned by related parties through January 2016,and where a stockholder and Company director was a member of the bank'sboard of directors through January 2016, and is now a member of its Corporate Advisory Council.           11               ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES       General Legal Matters    The Company is and may become subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with the normal course of its business. In the opinion of management, there are currently no claims that would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.        7.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS       In May 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 2,176,154 shares of itscommon stock, for gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million.Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $13.0 million, after payment of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million.The shares were sold under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200638) that was declared effective by the SEC on December 23, 2014.    Additionally, in May 2016, the Company amended its LSA with Oxford.This amdendment provided ADMA with an additional term loan of $4.0 million, the availability of which was predicated on the Company completing an equity raise of at least $10.0 million in gross proceeds by May 31, 2016. The Company subsequently borrowed the additional $4.0 million from Oxford under the amended LSA, and in connection therewith, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to24,800shares of the Company's Common Stock at an exercise price equal to $6.37, which will expire seven yearsafter their issuance on May 13, 2023and incurreda facility fee of$20,000 as part of accessing the additional funding.
