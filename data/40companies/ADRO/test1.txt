Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     1. Nature of Business  Aduro Biotech, Inc., or the Company, is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company located in Berkeley, California focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases. The Company was founded in 2000 under the name Oncologic, Inc., later merged with Triton BioSystems, Inc. in 2008, and subsequently changed its name to Aduro Biotech, Inc. in 2009. The Company's technology platforms, which are designed to harness the body's natural immune system, are being investigated in cancer indications and have the potential to expand into autoimmune and infectious diseases. The Company operates in one business segment.  The Company's Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted, or LADD, technology platform is based on proprietary attenuated strains of Listeria that have been engineered to express tumor-associated antigens to induce specific and targeted immune responses. The Company's cyclic dinucleotide, or CDN, platform is designed to activate the intracellular Stimulator of Interferon Genes, or STING, receptor, resulting in a potent tumor-specific immune response. The Company's pipeline of product candidates has the potential to be applicable to a variety of cancers and to be combinable with a range of conventional and emerging cancer therapies, including cellular vaccines, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors, among others. The Company is collaborating with leading global pharmaceutical companies to expand its products and technology platforms.        2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates, and Recent Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted, and accordingly the balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as our annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are necessary for a fair presentation of our financial information. The results of operations for the period ended September 30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2015 or for any other interim period or for any other future year.  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2014 included in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, clinical trial accruals, convertible preferred stock and related warrants, common stock and related warrants, income taxes and stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and relevant assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Initial Public Offering  On April 20, 2015, the Company closed its initial public offering, or IPO, and sold 8,050,000 shares of its common stock (inclusive of 1,050,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares) at a price to the public of $17.00 per share. The Company received aggregate net proceeds of $124.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The Company also sold to Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc., or NIBR, in a concurrent private placement 1,470,588 shares of common stock at a price of $17.00 per share for proceeds of $25.0 million (See Note 7). Upon the closing of the IPO, all then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock converted by their terms into 51,822,659 shares of common stock. Additionally, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation effective April 14, 2015 to, among other things, change the authorized number of shares of common stock to 300,000,000 shares and the authorized number of shares of preferred stock to 10,000,000 shares.     8   ADURO BIOTECH, INC.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Reverse Stock Split  On April 1, 2015, the Company effected a 0.72-for-1 reverse split of its common stock. Upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, (i) every 1 share of outstanding common stock was combined into 0.72 of a share of common stock, (ii) the number of shares of common stock for which each outstanding option or warrant to purchase common stock is exercisable was proportionally decreased on a 0.72-for-1 basis, (iii) the exercise price of each outstanding option or warrant to purchase common stock was proportionately increased on a 0.72-for-1 basis, and (iv) the conversion ratio for each share of preferred stock which was convertible into the Company's common stock was proportionately reduced on a 0.72-for-1 basis. All of the outstanding common stock share numbers, warrants to purchase common stock, common stock share prices, common stock exercise prices and per share amounts have been adjusted, on a retroactive basis, to reflect this 0.72-for-1 reverse stock split for all periods presented. The par value per share, authorized number of shares of common stock, preferred stock and preferred stock warrants were not adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split.  Offering Costs  Offering costs represent underwriting, legal, accounting and other direct costs related to the Company's IPO. These costs were deferred until completion of the IPO, at which time they were reclassified to additional paid-in capital as a reduction of the proceeds.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Auditing Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods and services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the currently effective guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of the ASU by one year to December 15, 2017 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those periods, beginning after that date. Entities are permitted to adopt in accordance with the original effective date of December 15, 2016 if they choose. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.        3. Fair Value Measurements  The carrying amounts of certain of the Company's financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable are approximated at their fair values due to their short maturities. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheets, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis or disclosed at fair value, are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair values. The accounting guidance for fair value provides a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about how fair value is determined. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance also establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based upon whether such inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions made by the reporting entity. The three-level hierarchy for the inputs to valuation techniques is briefly summarized as follows:  Level 1 -Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;  Level 2 -Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and  Level 3 -Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.     9   ADURO BIOTECH, INC.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     The Company's cash equivalents, which include money market funds, are classified as Level I because they are valued using quoted market prices. The Company's marketable securities consist of available-for-sale securities and are generally classified as Level II because their value is based on valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.  In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around the inputs to valuation, securities are classified as Level 3. Level 3 liabilities consist of common and preferred stock warrant liabilities. The determination of the fair value of the warrants is discussed in Note 8. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the underlying convertible preferred stock or common stock warrants are accounted for as (loss) gain from remeasurement of fair value of warrants in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.  The following table sets forth the Company's financial instruments that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):               The following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Company's Level 3 financial liabilities (in thousands):             10   ADURO BIOTECH, INC.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     5. Collaboration Agreements  Novartis Agreement  In March 2015, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, pursuant to which the Company is collaborating worldwide with Novartis regarding the development and potential commercialization of product candidates containing an agonist of the molecular target known as STING in the field of oncology, including immuno-oncology and cancer vaccines. Under this agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, the Company granted Novartis a co-exclusive license to develop such products worldwide, an exclusive license to commercialize such products outside the United States and a non-exclusive license to support the Company in commercializing such products in the United States if it requests such support. The collaboration is guided by a joint steering committee with each party having final decision making authority regarding specified areas of development or commercialization.  Under the Novartis Agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $200 million in April 2015. The Company is also eligible to receive up to an additional $250 million in development milestones and up to an additional $250 million in regulatory approval milestones.  The Company is responsible for 38% of the joint development costs worldwide and Novartis is responsible for the remaining 62% of the joint development costs worldwide.  The Company will also receive 50% of gross profits on sales of any products commercialized pursuant to this collaboration in the United States and 45% of gross profits for specified European countries and Japan. For each of these profit share countries, each party will be responsible for its respective commercial sharing percentage of all joint commercialization costs incurred in that country.  For all other countries where the Company is not sharing profits, Novartis will be responsible for all commercialization costs and will pay the Company a royalty in the mid-teens on all net sales of product sold by Novartis, its affiliates and sublicensees, with such percentage subject to reduction post patent and data exclusivity expiration and subject to reduction, capped at a specified percentage, for royalties payable to third party licensors. Novartis' royalty obligation will run on a country-by-country basis until the later of expiration of the last valid claim covering the product, expiration of data exclusivity for the product or 12 years after first commercial sale of the product in such country.  With respect to the United States, specified European countries and/or Japan, the Company may elect for such region to either reduce by 50% or to eliminate in full the Company's development and commercialization cost sharing obligation. If the Company elects to reduce its cost sharing percentage by 50% in any such region, then its profit share in such region will also be reduced by 50%. If the Company elects to eliminate its development cost sharing obligation, then such region will be removed from the profit share, and instead Novartis will owe the Company royalties on any net sales of product for such region, as described above.  The Company recognizes revenue from collaboration, license or research arrangements when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. The Company has determined that the license does not have stand-alone value separable from the co-development services to be performed under the agreement, with the Company participating in the research and development services. As a result, the Company recognizes revenue from the $200 million upfront fee received on a straight-line basis over its estimated performance period of 13.5 years, commencing in July 2015, the date of the Joint Steering Committee's approval of the research and development plan. Changes in the estimated period of performance will be accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate. The Company will recognize substantive milestone payments in their entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. Non-substantive milestone payments will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining performance period. Costs associated with co-development activities performed under the agreement are included in research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Reimbursement of development costs by Novartis is included in collaboration and license revenue. The Company will recognize revenue from the sale of any products commercialized pursuant to this collaboration in the United States, will retain 50% of the gross profits from such sales, and will pay the remaining 50% of the gross profits to Novartis. The Company will receive from Novartis 45% of gross profits for specified European countries and Japan. Profit sharing payments made to or received from Novartis are aggregated by product by territory and are reported as expenses or revenues, as applicable.  For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized revenue from its collaboration with Novartis totaling $3.7 million related to amortization of the upfront fees. The remaining balance of the upfront fees of $196.3 million is included in deferred revenue at September 30, 2015.     12   ADURO BIOTECH, INC.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Janssen ADU-741 and GVAX Prostate Agreements  In May 2014, the Company entered into a Research and License Agreement, or Janssen ADU-741 Agreement, and a GVAX Prostate License Agreement, or Janssen GVAX Prostate Agreement, with Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson Development Corporation, to collaborate on the development of a drug for the treatment of prostate cancer. Under the terms of the Janssen ADU-741 Agreement, the Company granted Janssen an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture, use, sell and otherwise exploit products containing ADU-741 for any and all uses. The Company is responsible for certain research and development activities from the effective date of the agreement until approval of an investigational new drug application, or IND.  Since the inception of the Janssen ADU-741 Agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $12.0 million and non-substantive and substantive milestone payments of $6.5 million upon completion of certain development activities. Under the terms of the Janssen ADU-741 Agreement, the Company may receive future nonrefundable milestone payments up to a total of $1.0 million after completion of various stages of the research and development activities, and the Company is eligible to receive future contingent payments up to a total of $345.5 million composed of development milestones through completion of all Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as launch, commercialization and sales milestones. The contingent payments are triggered upon the activities expected to be undertaken by Janssen. The Company is eligible to receive royalties on net sales of licensed products by Janssen, its affiliates and sublicensees at a rate ranging from mid-single digits to low teens based on aggregate annual net sales and based on the country of sale.  Under the Janssen GVAX Prostate Agreement, the Company granted Janssen an exclusive worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture, use, sell and otherwise exploit products containing GVAX Prostate for any and all uses. The Company received an upfront payment of $500,000 in May 2014 and is eligible to receive an additional $2.0 million on the achievement of a specified commercial milestone. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive royalties in the high single digits based on net sales of the product.  The development activities being conducted by the Company are based on a combination of the technology licensed under both agreements. Accordingly, the Company has accounted for the Janssen ADU-741 Agreement and Janssen GVAX Prostate Agreement as one arrangement and has identified the deliverables within the arrangement as a license to the technology and research and development activities through IND approval. The Company has determined that the licenses and development services under the license and research agreements represent a single unit of accounting. The licenses do not have stand-alone value to Janssen, separable from the development services to be performed under the agreement, as Janssen is unable to use the licenses for their intended purpose without the Company's performance of the research and development services. As a result, the Company recognizes revenue from the upfront payments ratably over the term of its estimated period of performance under the agreement. Changes in the estimated period of performance will be accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate. The upfront fees received totaling $12.5 million are being recognized on a straight-line basis from the effective date of the agreements through October 2015, the Company's estimated performance period. The Company will recognize non-substantive milestone payments on a straight-line basis through October 2015, the Company's estimated performance period.  For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized revenue from its Janssen ADU-741 and GVAX Prostate Agreements totaling $2.7 million and $9.2 million, respectively, related to amortization of the upfront fees and development-related milestones. The remaining balance of the payments received of $0.5 million is included in deferred revenue at September 30, 2015, which will be fully amortized as of October 2015.  Janssen ADU-214 Agreement  In November 2014, the Company entered into a Research and License Agreement with Janssen, or Janssen ADU-214 Agreement, to develop a drug for the treatment of lung cancer. Under the terms of the Janssen ADU-214 Agreement, the Company granted Janssen an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture, use, sell and otherwise exploit products containing ADU-214 for any and all uses. Janssen has agreed not to administer or cause to be administered ADU-214 in humans in clinical trials for the treatment of pancreatic cancer or mesothelioma. The Company is responsible for certain research and development activities from the effective date of the agreement until IND approval. Since the inception of the Janssen ADU-214 Agreement, the Company received an upfront license fee of $30.0 million and a substantive milestone payment of $0.5 million upon submission of an IND. Under the terms of the Janssen ADU-214 Agreement, the Company may receive future nonrefundable milestone payments up to a total of $10.5 million after completion of various stages of the research and development activities, and the Company is eligible to receive future contingent payments up to a total of $776.0 million composed of development milestones through completion of all Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as regulatory and commercial milestones. The contingent payments are triggered upon the activities expected to be undertaken by Janssen. The Company is eligible to receive royalties on any net sales of licensed products by Janssen, its affiliates and sublicensees at a rate ranging from high-single digits to low teens based on the aggregate annual net sales of licensed products worldwide and based on the country of sale.     13   ADURO BIOTECH, INC.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     The upfront license fee of $30.0 million is being recognized on a straight-l ine basis from the effective date of the agreement t hrough October 2015, the Company's estimated performance period which was accelerated based on progress in the development program during the third quarter of 2015 .  For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized revenue from Janssen ADU-214 Agreement totaling $11.1 million and $22.9 million, respectively, related to amortization of the upfront fees and development-related milestones. The remaining balance of the payments received of $4.4 million is included in deferred revenue at September 30, 2015 which will be fully amortized as of October 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company completed certain research and development activities associated with a $10.0 million nonrefundable milestone and expects to receive payment prior to the end of 2015.        6. Commitments and Contingencies  Leases  The Company leases its office and research and development facility in Berkeley, California, under a non-cancelable operating lease. In February 2015, the Company amended its office lease agreement to increase the total square footage to approximately 25,000 square feet and extended the term of the lease to expire on December 31, 2018. The lease also contains an option to extend the lease for an additional two years. Rent expense was $0.2 million and $0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively and was $0.4 million and $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  In September 2015, the Company entered into an Office/Laboratory Lease, or the Lease, for approximately 56,452 square feet of office and laboratory space at a new facility located in Berkeley, California, or the Facility. The term of the Lease commences when the landlord delivers possession of the Facility to the Company. Upon commencement, the Lease has an initial term of twelve years.  The Company has the option to extend the Lease beyond the Initial Term for up to two renewal terms of five years each, provided that the rental rate would be subject to market adjustment at the beginning of each renewal term. The Company also has a one-time option that may be exercised any time prior to July 1, 2016 to lease additional space within the Facility of approximately 25,600 square feet commencing January 1, 2017 and approximately 28,801 square feet commencing January 1, 2018.  Indemnifications  In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into agreements that may include indemnification provisions. Pursuant to such agreements, the Company may indemnify, hold harmless and defend an indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party. Some of the provisions will limit losses to those arising from third party actions. In some cases, the indemnification will continue after the termination of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these provisions is not determinable. The Company has never incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. The Company has also entered into indemnification agreements with its directors, officers and key employees that may require the Company to indemnify such individuals against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or key employees to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware corporate law. The Company currently has directors' and officers' insurance.  Legal  During the normal course of business, the Company may be a party to legal claims that may not be covered by insurance. Management does not believe that any such claims would have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.     14   ADURO BIOTECH, INC.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     Other Commitments  The Company has various manufacturing, clinical, research and other contracts with vendors in the conduct of the normal course of its business. All contracts are terminable, with varying provisions regarding termination. If a contract with a specific vendor were to be terminated, the Company would only be obligated for the products or services that the Company had received at the time the termination became effective as well as non-cancelable and non-refundable payment obligations incurred by the vendor for products or services before the termination became effective. In the case of terminating a clinical trial agreement at a particular site, the Company would also be obligated to provide continued support for appropriate medical procedures at that site until completion or termination.        7. Convertible Preferred Stock  Novartis Stock Purchase  Concurrent with the March 2015 entry into the Novartis Agreement (See Note 5), the Company and NIBR, entered into a stock purchase agreement to purchase 2,361,029 shares of the Company's Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (or 1,699,940 shares of common stock on an as-converted basis) for $25.0 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, these preferred shares converted into common stock. Under the stock purchase agreement, NIBR purchased an additional $25.0 million of the Company's common stock concurrent with the completion of the IPO at the initial price per share offered to the public.        8. Warrant Liabilities  In April 2011, the Company issued warrants to purchase 24,235 shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock, or Series A-1 warrants, and 83,771 warrants to purchase shares of Series B convertible preferred stock, or Series B warrants. The Series A-1 warrants and Series B warrants were immediately exercisable and expire, if not exercised, in April 2021 and April 2016, respectively. As the shares into which the warrants were exercisable were contingently redeemable, the Company recognized a liability for the fair value of the warrants on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.  At the date of the IPO, the Series A-1 warrants and Series B warrants became exercisable for common stock and were no longer contingently redeemable. At the IPO, the ending fair value of these warrants of $1.2 million was reclassified to additional paid-in capital, and the change in fair value of $1.1 million was recognized as loss from remeasurement of fair value of warrants in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  In April, June, and October 2011, the Company issued warrants to purchase 615,658 shares of common stock. The common stock warrants were exercisable beginning in April 2015 and would have terminated in whole or part, if the Company had obtained certain levels of government grant funds by April 15, 2015. The warrants expire, if not exercised, in April 2021. As the warrants were subject to performance conditions which may result in the issuance of a variable number of shares, the Company recognized a liability for the fair value of the common stock warrants on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.  At April 15, 2015, the Company did not obtain the specified levels of government grant funds and the performance conditions expired and the number of common shares issuable was fixed. On April 15, 2015, the ending fair value of the common stock warrants of $25.9 million was reclassified to additional paid-in capital, and the change in fair value of $25.0 million was recognized as loss from remeasurement of fair value of warrants in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  The key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for the valuation of the convertible preferred stock warrants were as follows:             15   ADURO BIOTECH, INC.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     The key assumptions used in the Black-S c holes option-pricing model for the valuation of the common stock warrants were as follows:             9. Stock-Based Compensation Plans  2015 Stock Option Plan  In March 2015, the Company's board of directors adopted and in April 2015 the Company's stockholders approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2015 Plan, which became effective upon the IPO and provides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, and other forms of stock awards to its employees, directors and consultants.  The 2015 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors, which determines the types of awards to be granted, including the number of shares subject to the awards, the exercise price and the vesting schedule. The exercise price of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options will be no less than 100% of the fair value per share of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. If an individual owns capital stock representing more than 10% of the voting shares, the price of each share will be at least 110% of the fair value on the date of grant. Options expire after 10 years (five years for stockholders owning greater than 10% of the voting stock). The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan is 6,134,292 shares with an automatic annual increase to the shares issuable under the 2015 Plan to the lower of (i) 4% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or (ii) a lower number determined by the Board of Directors.     2009 Stock Incentive Plan  The Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan, terminated on the date the 2015 Plan was adopted. Options granted or shares issued under the 2009 Plan that were outstanding on the date the 2015 Plan became effective will remain subject to the terms of its plan. Prior to the 2009 Plan termination, the number of options available for grant was increased by 360,000 shares. At September 30, 2015, 8,760,285 options under the 2009 Plan remained outstanding.  Stock option activity under the Company's 2015 Plan and 2009 Plan was as follows:             16   ADURO BIOTECH, INC.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In March 2015, the Company's board of directors adopted and in April 2015 the Company's stockholders approved the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP, which became effective upon the IPO. The 2015 ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code, and is administered by the Company's board of directors and the Compensation Committee of the board of directors.  Stock-based Compensation Expense  Total stock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows (in thousands):          In determining the fair value of the stock-based awards, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of stock-based awards granted to employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was estimated at the date of grant using the following assumptions:                10. Income Taxes  The Company did not record a provision or benefit for income taxes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. The Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance for its net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.  The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 , Accounting for Income Taxes . As of September 30, 2015 and 2014, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2015 and 2014, no amount of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the Company's annual effective tax rate because the benefits are in the form of deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance has been recorded.  The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of September 30, 2015 and 2014, the Company accrued no interest and penalties in the statement of financial position. Total interest and penalties included in the statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 are each zero. The Company does not expect the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly within the next 12 months.  The Company is subject to taxation for U.S. federal and the state of California purposes only. The Company's federal and California tax returns are open by statute for tax years 2011 and 2010 forward, respectively, and could be subject to examination by the tax authorities .           17   ADURO BIOTECH, INC.

Net Income ( Loss ) per Common Share  Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share gives effect to dilutive stock options and warrants. The Company uses the treasury-stock method to compute diluted earnings per share with respect to its stock options and warrants. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands except share and per share amounts):          The potential dilutive securities excluded from diluted net income (loss) per common share were as follows (in thousands):             12. Subsequent Event  On October 30, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition, or the Acquisition, of all of the issued and outstanding shares of BioNovion Holding B.V., a private limited liability company organized under the laws of the Netherlands, or BioNovion, pursuant to the Share Sale Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, dated September 24, 2015, by and among the Company, Aduro Netherlands Co&ouml;peratief U.A., a cooperative organized under the laws of the Netherlands and a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, or Aduro Netherlands, BioNovion, and the shareholders of BioNovion, or the Sellers. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Aduro Netherlands acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of BioNovion from the Sellers for an aggregate purchase price of (i) EUR 14,500,000 in cash and (ii) 697,306 shares of common stock of the Company, or the Common Stock, subject to a post-closing adjustment based on working capital, net cash and borrowings of BioNovion and its subsidiary as of the closing date under the Purchase Agreement.

Item 2.
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and with our audited financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2014, included in our prospectus dated April 14, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Prospectus. This discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section of this report titled "Risk factors."  Forward-Looking Statements  This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as "believe," "will," "may," "estimate," "continue," "anticipate," "intend," "should," "plan," "expect," "predict," "could," "potentially" or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. You should read these statements carefully because they discuss future expectations, contain projections of future results of operations or financial condition, or state other "forward-looking" information. These statements relate to our future plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and financial performance and the assumptions that underlie these statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this report in Part II, Item 1A - "Risk Factors," and elsewhere in this report. Forward-looking statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of their date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments. We caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.  Overview  We are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases. Our technology platforms, which are designed to harness the body's natural immune system, are being investigated in cancer indications and have the potential to expand into autoimmune and infectious diseases. Immuno-oncology encompasses a class of therapies that leverage the patient's immune system to slow the growth and spread of, or eliminate, tumor cells. We believe a critical distinguishing factor in our approach to immuno-oncology is that our novel therapies initiate powerful innate immune responses and drive targeted, durable adaptive immune responses. The immunotherapy field is rapidly advancing with new immuno-oncology combinations that focus on strengthening therapeutic efficacy in a wide range of cancers. We intend to pursue a broad strategy of combining our technology platforms with conventional and novel immuno-oncology therapies, based on their mechanisms of action, safety profiles and versatility.  Our pipeline of immuno-oncology product candidates is derived from two proprietary technology platforms: Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted, or LADD, Listeria monocytogenes and cyclic dinucleotides, or CDNs. Our lead LADD product candidate, CRS-207, is currently being developed in metastatic pancreatic cancer and unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. Our lead immuno-oncology regimen of CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and we have obtained orphan drug designations from the FDA for CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and for CRS-207 for the treatment of mesothelioma. We are developing a pipeline of proprietary product candidates, including two product candidates in collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, targeting prostate and lung cancers. In addition, we established a worldwide collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, for CDN product candidates in oncology.  Financial Operations Overview  Revenue  We have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our revenue to date has been primarily derived from two separate research and license agreements we entered into with Janssen, which became effective in May 2014 and in November 2014, our worldwide collaboration agreement with Novartis established in March 2015, and research and development grants from the U.S. government. We recognize revenue from upfront payments under our collaboration agreements ratably over the term of our estimated period of performance under the agreement. In addition to receiving upfront payments, we may also be entitled to milestone and other contingent payments upon achieving predefined objectives. Revenue from milestones, if they are nonrefundable and deemed     19      substantive, are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones. To the extent that non-substantive milestones are achieved and we have remaining performance obligations, milestones are deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated rem aining period of performance . We recognize revenue related to research and development grants when the related research expenses are incurred and our specific performance obligations under the terms of the respective contracts are satisfied .  We expect that any revenue we generate from our collaboration with Novartis, research and license agreements with Janssen, government research and development grants, and any future collaboration partners will fluctuate from year to year as a result of the timing and amount of milestones and other payments.  Research and Development Expenses  The largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities, including the clinical development and manufacturing of our product candidates. Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research, such as the discovery and development of our product candidates, as well as the development of product candidates pursuant to our collaboration with Novartis and research and license agreement with Janssen. We recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred. Clinical trial costs, contract manufacturing and other development costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.  We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we advance our product candidates into and through clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. The actual probability of success for our product candidates and technology platforms may be affected by a variety of factors including: the quality of our product candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical program, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses include personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services and other allocated expenses. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses and benefits. Outside professional services consist of legal, accounting and audit services and other consulting fees. Allocated expenses consist of rent expense related to our office and research and development facility. We expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and those of any national securities exchange on which our securities are traded, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services.  Loss from Remeasurement of Fair Value of Warrants  Loss from remeasurement of fair value of warrants consists of losses from the remeasurement of the fair value of our liabilities related to our convertible preferred stock warrants and common stock warrants.  Interest Income (Expense), Net  Interest income (expense), net consists of interest income from our marketable securities. Interest expense consists of amortization of debt discount associated with convertible promissory note warrants, issuance of the equity component of a convertible promissory note and beneficial conversion features associated with certain convertible promissory notes, as well as stated interest costs associated with our borrowings.  Other Income, Net  Other income, net consists of gains and losses from the change in the fair value of the convertible promissory note warrants.     20      Results of Operations  Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 and 2014          Revenue  Collaboration and license revenue was $18.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $16.3 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2014. The increase is primarily due to $13.8 million in revenue recognized from the upfront fees and development-related milestones achieved under the Janssen agreements and $3.7 million in revenue recognized from the upfront fee received from Novartis. During the third quarter of 2015, our estimated period of performance of research and development services under the Janssen agreement was accelerated to October 2015, and as a result, $4.2 million of revenue was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2015 that would have been recognized in future periods. The Novartis upfront fee is being recognized on a straight-line basis over our estimated performance period of 13.5 years, commencing in July 2015.  Grant revenue was $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.4 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to an increase in grant-related research and development.  Research and Development Expenses  The following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:          Research and development expenses were $11.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $6.0 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2014. The increase was primarily attributed to a $2.9 million increase in contract manufacturing costs of our clinical product candidates; a $1.2 million increase in clinical development expenses mainly associated with ongoing trials for our lead indication in pancreatic cancer; a $1.0 million of incremental compensation and related personnel expenses associated with additional research and development headcount; a $0.4 million increase in other research and development costs primarily for our CDN program; and a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation.     21      General and Administrative Expenses  The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:          General and administrative expenses were $6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $4.9 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $1.9 million increase in consulting and other professional services fees; a $1.3 million increase in stock-based compensation; a $1.2 million increase in compensation and related personnel expenses primarily related to additional general and administrative headcount; and a $0.3 million increase in other general and administrative costs.  Loss from Remeasurement of Fair Value of Warrants  Loss from remeasurement of fair value of warrants was zero for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $0.2 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2014. As of April 2015, all of the convertible preferred stock warrants and common stock warrants were no longer subject to remeasurement due to the IPO or expiration of the performance condition. Therefore, no such gain or loss from remeasurement of the warrants was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Interest Income (Expense), Net  Interest income from our marketable securities was $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2014, we did not have any marketable securities. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was primarily composed of interest costs associated with our borrowings. We did not have any borrowings during the three months ended September 30, 2015.     Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 and 2014             22      Revenue  Collaboration and license revenue was $37.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $34.3 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The increase is primarily due to $32.0 million in revenue recognized from the upfront fees and development-related milestones achieved under the Janssen agreements and $3.7 million in revenue recognized from the upfront fee received from Novartis. During the third quarter of 2015, our estimated period of performance of research and development services under the Janssen agreement was accelerated to October 2015, and as a result, $4.2 million of revenue was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 that would have been recognized in future periods. The Novartis upfront fee is being recognized on a straight-line basis over our estimated performance period of 13.5 years, commencing in July 2015.  Grant revenue was $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.8 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to an increase in grant-related research and development.  Research and Development Expenses  The following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:          Research and development expenses were $36.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $20.0 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The increase was primarily attributed to a $4.6 million increase in contract manufacturing costs of our clinical product candidates; $4.5 million of incremental compensation and related personnel expenses associated with additional research and development headcount; a $4.2 million increase in clinical development expenses mainly associated with ongoing trials for our lead indication in pancreatic cancer; a $3.0 million increase in licensing fees; a $2.5 million increase in other research and development costs primarily for our CDN program; and a $1.1 million increase in stock-based compensation.  General and Administrative Expenses  The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:             23      General and administrative expenses were $1 9.0 million for the nine  months ended September 30 , 2015, an increase of $13.5 million, compared to the nine  months ended September 30 , 2014. The increase was primarily due to $4. 4  million of incremental legal, consulting and other professional services fees related to our collaboration agreement, general corporate matters and accounting support ;  a $3.9 million increase in compensation and related personnel expenses primarily related to additional general and administrative headcount ; a $3.7 million increase in stock-based compensation; a $1.0  million increase in other general and administrative costs ; and a $0. 5 million increase in facility costs .  Loss from Remeasurement of Fair Value of Warrants  Loss from remeasurement of fair value of warrants was $26.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $25.8 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The increase in expense was primarily due to the higher stock prices used in the remeasurement of the fair value of liability classified preferred and common stock warrants. As of April 2015, all of the convertible preferred stock warrants and common stock warrants were no longer subject to remeasurement due to the IPO or expiration of the performance condition.  Gain on Extinguishment of Convertible Promissory Notes  During 2013 and 2014, we issued convertible promissory notes to related parties, which were subsequently converted in May 2014 to Series C convertible preferred stock. The conversion of convertible promissory notes was determined to be an extinguishment of debt and a portion of the reacquisition price was allocated to the reacquisition of the embedded beneficial conversion feature. We recorded a gain on extinguishment of $3.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014, as the amount allocated to reacquire the notes was less than the carrying value of the notes.  Interest Income (Expense), Net  Interest income from our marketable securities was $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we did not have any marketable securities. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was due to the amortization of debt discount associated with convertible promissory note warrants, debt discount associated with the equity component of a convertible promissory note and beneficial conversion features attributable to certain promissory notes, as well as stated interest costs associated with our borrowings. We did not have any borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  To date, our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds from the initial public offering, sale of convertible preferred stock, proceeds from our collaboration and license agreements and revenue from government grants. At September 30, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $448.4 million. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalent and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based our cash sufficiency estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or in excess of amounts that we currently expect, which could adversely affect our development activities.  In March 2015, we established a worldwide collaboration with Novartis for the development and commercialization of products containing an agonist of the molecular target known as STING in the field of oncology, including immuno-oncology and cancer vaccines. Under the Novartis Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $200 million in April 2015. We are also eligible to receive up to an additional $250 million in development milestones and up to an additional $250 million in regulatory approval milestones. Concurrent with the entry into the Novartis Agreement, we and Novartis Institutes of BioMedical Research, Inc., or NIBR, entered into a stock purchase agreement to purchase 2,361,029 shares of our Series E Preferred Stock (which converted into 1,699,940 shares of common stock at the completion of the IPO), for $25.0 million.  On April 20, 2015, we closed our initial public offering, or IPO, and sold 8,050,000 shares of our common stock (inclusive of 1,050,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares) at a price to the public of $17.00 per share. We received aggregate net proceeds of $124.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We also sold to NIBR in a concurrent private placement 1,470,588 shares of common stock at a price of $17.00 per share for proceeds of $25.0 million (See Note 7). Upon the closing of the IPO, all then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock converted by their terms into 51,822,659 shares of common stock. Additionally, we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation effective April 14, 2015 to, among other things, change the authorized number of shares of common stock to 300,000,000 shares and the authorized number of shares of preferred stock to 10,000,000 shares.     24      Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, third-party clinical, manufacturing, and o ther research and development services, laboratory and related supplies, and legal and other professional services. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accoun ts payable and accrued expenses. We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates , s pecifically in connection with our Phase 2b ECLIPSE clinical trial in met astatic pancreatic cancer , manufacturing of our product candidates, and advancement of CRS-207 in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy into Phase 3 clinical development for mesothelioma .  We plan to continue to fund our operations and capital funding needs through equity and/or debt financing. We may also consider entering into additional collaboration arrangements or selectively partnering for clinical development and commercialization. In addition, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to the equity capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. If we are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible and/or suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.  Cash Flows  The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:          Operating Activities  Net cash provided by operating activities was $157.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to cash used of $5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The increase was primarily due to a $200 million upfront payment received from Novartis, partially offset by the increase in net loss of $26.2 million primarily due to increased research and development and general and administrative expenses.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities was $269.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of purchases of marketable securities and laboratory and office equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities was $173.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to $37.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The increase was primarily related to $124.2 million in net proceeds from the IPO, $25.0 million in gross proceeds from the private placement and $25.0 million in net proceeds from sale of Series E convertible preferred stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included net proceeds from the sale of Series C convertible preferred stock amounting to $36.9 million.     25      Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments described under the section titled &quot;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&quot; in the Prospectus.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.
