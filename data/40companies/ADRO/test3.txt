Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements        1. Organization and Nature of Business  Aduro Biotech, Inc., or the Company, is an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases. The Company's technology platforms, which are designed to harness the body's natural immune system, are being investigated in cancer indications and have the potential to expand into autoimmune and infectious diseases. The Company operates in one business segment.  The Company has developed three technology platforms, Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted or LADD, STING Pathway Activator and B-select monoclonal antibodies. The Company's LADD technology platform is based on proprietary attenuated strains of Listeria that have been engineered to express tumor-associated antigens to induce specific and targeted immune responses. This platform is being developed as a treatment for multiple indications, including mesothelioma, ovarian, pancreatic, lung and prostate cancers, and glioblastoma. The Company's STING Pathway Activator platform is designed to activate the intracellular Stimulator of Interferon Genes, or STING, receptor, resulting in a potent tumor-specific immune response. The Company's B-select monoclonal antibody platform includes a number of immune modulating assets in research and preclinical development and is led by the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary based in the Netherlands, Aduro Biotech Holdings, Europe B.V. (fka BioNovion Holding B.V.), or Aduro Biotech Europe. The Company is also collaborating with leading global pharmaceutical companies to expand its products and technology platforms.  Initial Public Offering and Concurrent Private Placement  On April 20, 2015, the Company closed its initial public offering, or IPO, and sold 8,050,000 shares of its common stock (inclusive of 1,050,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares) at a price to the public of $17.00 per share. The Company received aggregate net proceeds of $124.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The Company also sold to Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc., or NIBR, in a concurrent private placement 1,470,588 shares of common stock at a price of $17.00 per share for proceeds of $25.0 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock converted by their terms into 51,822,659 shares of common stock. Additionally, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation effective April 20, 2015 to, among other things, change the authorized number of shares of common stock to 300,000,000 shares and the authorized number of shares of preferred stock to 10,000,000 shares.        2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Recent Accounting Pronouncements  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and follow the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted, and accordingly the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as our annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are necessary for a fair presentation of our financial information. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any other interim period or for any other future year.  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.   7   Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, clinical trial accruals, contingent consideration, income taxes and stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and relevant assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.        Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Auditing Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606 ). This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods and services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the currently effective guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of the ASU by one year to December 15, 2017 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after that date. Entities are permitted to adopt ASU 2014-09 in accordance with the original effective date of December 15, 2016 if they choose. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which establishes a comprehensive new lease accounting model. The new standard: (a) clarifies the definition of a lease; (b) requires a dual approach to lease classification similar to current lease classifications; and, (c) causes lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with a lease-term of more than twelve months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires modified retrospective application. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) . The standard changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The Company will recognize an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities rather than deductions in amortized cost. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.        8   3. Fair Value Measurements  The carrying amounts of certain of the Company's financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheets, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis or disclosed at fair value, are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair values. The accounting guidance for fair value provides a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about how fair value is determined. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance also establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based upon whether such inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions made by the reporting entity. The three-level hierarchy for the inputs to valuation techniques is briefly summarized as follows:  Level 1 -Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;  Level 2 -Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and  Level 3 -Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.  The Company's cash equivalents, which include money market funds, are classified as Level 1 because they are valued using quoted market prices. The Company's marketable securities consist of available-for-sale securities and are generally classified as Level 2 because their value is based on valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.  In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around the inputs to valuation, securities are classified as Level 3. Level 3 liabilities consist of the contingent consideration liability.  The following table sets forth the Company's financial instruments that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):               9   The acquisition-date fair value of the contingent consideration liability represents the future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specifie d development milestones for a product candidate. The fair value of the contingent consideration is based on the Company's probability-weighted discounted cash flow assessment that considers probability and timing of future payments. The fair value measure ment is based on significant Level 3 inputs such as anticipated timelines and probability of achieving development milestones. Changes in the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration, except for the impact of foreign currency, will be recog nized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations until settlement.  The Company did not have any financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. There were no transfers between the fair value measurement category levels during any of the periods presented.  The following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Company's Level 3 financial liabilities (in thousands):          The following tables summarize the estimated value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the gross unrealized holding gains and losses (in thousands):               10   The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the Company's available-for-sale marketable securities by contractual maturity are summarized below as of June 30, 2016 (in thousands):             4. Balance Sheet Components  Property and Equipment, Net  Property and equipment, net consisted of the following (in thousands):          Depreciation and amortization expense was $382,000 and $126,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $739,000 and $219,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities  Accrued expenses and other liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):             5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Goodwill  The gross carrying amount of goodwill was as follows (in thousands):          11   Intangible assets  The gross carrying amounts and net book value of our intangible assets were as follows (in thousands):               Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. The license agreement is being amortized over a period of 20 years and the amortization expense is recorded in operating expenses. The increase in the gross carrying amount of intangible assets as of June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 reflected a positive impact of foreign currency exchange which was primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.   Amortization expense was $140,000 and $277,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. There was no amortization expense for the comparable periods in 2015. Based on finite-lived intangible assets recorded as of June 30, 2016, the estimated future amortization expense is as follows (in thousands):             6. Collaboration Agreements  Novartis Agreement  In March 2015, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, pursuant to which the Company is collaborating worldwide with Novartis regarding the development and potential commercialization of product candidates containing an agonist of the molecular target known as STING in the field of oncology, including immuno-oncology and cancer vaccines. Under this agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, the Company granted Novartis a co-exclusive license to develop such products worldwide, an exclusive license to commercialize such products outside the United States and a non-exclusive license to support the Company in commercializing such products in the United States if it requests such support. The collaboration is guided by a joint steering committee with each party having final decision making authority regarding specified areas of development or commercialization.  Under the Novartis Agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $200.0 million in April 2015. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company earned a $35.0 million development milestone upon initiation of a Phase 1 trial for the first STING product candidate, ADU-S100, and recognized the payment as revenue in the period. The Company is also eligible to receive up to an additional $215.0 million in development milestones and up to an additional $250.0 million in regulatory approval milestones.   The Company is responsible for 38% of the joint development costs worldwide and Novartis is responsible for the remaining 62% of the joint development costs worldwide.  12   The Company will also receive 50% of gross profits on sales of any products commercialized pursuant to this collaboration in the United States and 45% of gross profits for spe cified European countries and Japan. For each of these profit share countries, each party will be responsible for its respective commercial sharing percentage of all joint commercialization costs incurred in that country.  For all other countries where the Company is not sharing profits, Novartis will be responsible for all commercialization costs and will pay the Company a royalty in the mid-teens on all net sales of product sold by Novartis, its affiliates and sublicensees, with such percentage subject to reduction post patent and data exclusivity expiration and subject to reduction, capped at a specified percentage, for royalties payable to third party licensors. Novartis' royalty obligation will run on a country-by-country basis until the later of expiration of the last valid claim covering the product, expiration of data exclusivity for the product or 12 years after first commercial sale of the product in such country.  With respect to the United States, specified European countries and/or Japan, the Company may elect for such region to either reduce by 50% or to eliminate in full the Company's development and commercialization cost sharing obligation. If the Company elects to reduce its cost sharing percentage by 50% in any such region, then its profit share in such region will also be reduced by 50%. If the Company elects to eliminate its development cost sharing obligation, then such region will be removed from the profit share, and instead Novartis will owe the Company royalties on any net sales of product for such region, as described above.  The Company recognizes revenue from collaboration, license or research arrangements when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. The Company has determined that the license does not have stand-alone value separable from the co-development services to be performed under the agreement, with the Company participating in the research and development services. As a result, the Company recognizes revenue from the $200.0 million upfront fee received on a straight-line basis over its estimated performance period of 13.5 years, commencing in July 2015, the date of the Joint Steering Committee's approval of the research and development plan. Changes in the estimated period of performance will be accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate. The Company will recognize substantive milestone payments in their entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. Non-substantive milestone payments will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining performance period. Costs associated with co-development activities performed under the agreement are included in research and development expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Reimbursement of research and development costs by Novartis is included in collaboration and license revenue. The Company will recognize revenue from the sale of any products commercialized pursuant to this collaboration in the United States, will retain 50% of the gross profits from such sales, and will pay the remaining 50% of the gross profits to Novartis. The Company will receive from Novartis 45% of gross profits for specified European countries and Japan. Profit sharing payments made to or received from Novartis are aggregated by product by territory and are reported as expenses or revenues, as applicable.  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized revenue from its collaboration with Novartis totaling $3.7 million and $7.4 million, respectively, related to amortization of the upfront fee. The remaining balance of the upfront fees of $185.2 million is included in deferred revenue at June 30, 2016.   Janssen ADU-214 Agreement  In November 2014, the Company entered into a Research and License Agreement with Janssen, or Janssen ADU-214 Agreement, to develop a drug for the treatment of lung cancer. Under the terms of the Janssen ADU-214 Agreement, the Company granted Janssen an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture, use, sell and otherwise exploit products containing ADU-214 for any and all uses. Janssen has agreed not to administer or cause to be administered ADU-214 in humans in clinical trials for the treatment of pancreatic cancer or mesothelioma. The Company was responsible for certain research and development activities from the effective date of the agreement until investigational new drug application, or IND, approval which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Since the inception of the Janssen ADU-214 Agreement through June 30, 2016, the Company received an upfront license fee of $30.0 million and substantive and non-substantive milestone payments of $21.0 million upon completion of various development activities. Under the terms of the Janssen ADU-214 Agreement, the Company is eligible to receive future contingent payments up to a total of $766.0 million composed of development milestones through completion of all Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as regulatory and commercial milestones. The contingent payments are triggered upon the activities expected to be undertaken by Janssen. The Company is eligible to receive royalties on any net sales of licensed products by Janssen, its affiliates and sublicensees at a rate ranging from high-single digits to low teens based on the aggregate annual net sales of licensed products worldwide and based on the country of sale.  The upfront license fee of $30.0 million was recognized on a straight-line basis from the effective date of the agreement through October 2015. In addition the Company recognized milestone payments of $21.0 million in 2015 as all performance obligations were achieved.  13   Janssen ADU-741 and GVAX Prostate Agreements  In May 2014, the Company entered into a Research and License Agreement, or Janssen ADU-741 Agreement, and a GVAX Prostate License Agreement, or Janssen GVAX Prostate Agreement, with Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson Development Corporation, to collaborate on the development of a drug for the treatment of prostate cancer. Under the terms of the Janssen ADU-741 Agreement, the Company granted Janssen an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture, use, sell and otherwise exploit products containing ADU-741 for any and all uses. The Company was responsible for certain research and development activities from the effective date of the agreement until IND approval which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Since the inception of the Janssen ADU-741 Agreement through June 30, 2016, the Company received an upfront payment of $12.0 million and substantive and non-substantive milestone payments of $10.0 million upon completion of certain development activities. Under the terms of the Janssen ADU-741 Agreement, the Company is eligible to receive future contingent payments up to a total of $343.0 million composed of development milestones through completion of all Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as regulatory and commercial milestones. The contingent payments are triggered upon the activities expected to be undertaken by Janssen. The Company is eligible to receive royalties on net sales of licensed products by Janssen, its affiliates and sublicensees at a rate ranging from mid-single digits to low teens based on aggregate annual net sales and based on the country of sale.  Under the Janssen GVAX Prostate Agreement, the Company granted Janssen an exclusive worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture, use, sell and otherwise exploit products containing GVAX Prostate for any and all uses. The Company received an upfront payment of $500,000 in May 2014 and is eligible to receive an additional $2.0 million on the achievement of a specified commercial milestone. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive royalties in the high single digits based on net sales of the product.   The upfront fees received totaling $12.5 million were recognized on a straight-line basis from the effective date of the agreements through October 2015. In addition, the Company recognized milestone payments of $10 million in 2015 as all performance obligations were achieved.     Pharma License Agreement  In connection with the acquisition of Aduro Biotech Europe in October 2015, the Company became party to an agreement with a third-party pharmaceutical company, or Pharma. The agreement sets forth the parties' respective obligations for development, commercialization, regulatory and manufacturing and supply activities for antibody product candidates. The Company identified the following performance deliverables under the agreement: 1) the license, 2) the obligation to provide research activities and 3) the obligation to participate on a Joint Research Committee.   The Company is eligible to receive future contingent payments, including up to $312.0 million in potential development milestone payments, and up to $135.0 million in commercial and net sales milestones for a product candidate. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive royalties in the mid-single digits to low teens based on net sales of the product.  The Company considered the provisions of the multiple-element arrangement guidance in determining how to recognize the total consideration of the agreement. The Company determined that none of the deliverables have standalone value; all of these obligations will be delivered throughout the estimated period of performance and therefore are accounted for as a single unit of accounting.  The Company determined that all of the future contingent payments meet the definition of a milestone. Accordingly, revenue for the achievement of these milestones will be recognized in the period when the milestone is achieved and collectability is reasonably assured. No amounts had been recognized as revenue for any of these milestones for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.        7. Commitments and Contingencies  Leases  The Company leases its office and research and development facility in Berkeley, California, under a non-cancelable operating lease. In February 2015, the Company amended its office lease agreement to increase the total square footage to approximately 25,000 square feet and extended the term of the lease to expire on December 31, 2018. The lease also contains an option to extend the lease for an additional two years.  14   In September 2015, the Company entered into an Office/Laboratory Lease for approximately 56,000 square feet of office and labo ratory space at a new facility located in Berkeley, California. The Company began incurring rent expense when the landlord delivered possession of the facility to the Company in March 2016. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company amended the lease t o include approximately 7,000 additional square feet and on June 30, 2016 the Company exercised its option for approximately 41,000 additional square feet, representing the remaining space within the facility. The lease has an initial term of twelve years, which was extended to approximately thirteen and a half years as a result of the option exercised on June 30, 2016. The Company has the right to further extend the lease term for up to two renewal terms of five years each, provided that the rental rate wo uld be subject to market adjustment at the beginning of each renewal term.   During 2016, we established a letter of credit with Bank of America Merrill Lynch as security for the lease in the amount of $0.5 million. The letter of credit is collateralized by a certificate of deposit for $0.5 million which has been included in restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.  The Company also has office and laboratory space in Oss, the Netherlands, for employees of Aduro Biotech Europe. The term of the lease is through December 2017, with a one-year renewal option.  Rent expense was $1.0 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1.2 million and $0.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Under the terms of the lease agreements, the Company is also responsible for certain insurance, property tax and maintenance expenses. Future minimum payments under the Company's office leases at June 30, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):          Indemnification  In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into agreements that may include indemnification provisions. Pursuant to such agreements, the Company may indemnify, hold harmless and defend an indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party. Some of the provisions will limit losses to those arising from third party actions. In some cases, the indemnification will continue after the termination of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these provisions is not determinable. The Company has never incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. The Company has also entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware corporate law. The Company currently has directors' and officers' insurance.  Legal  We are not party to any material legal proceedings at this time. From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business.  Other Commitments  The Company has various manufacturing, clinical, research and other contracts with vendors in the conduct of the normal course of its business. All contracts are terminable, with varying provisions regarding termination. If a contract with a specific vendor were to be terminated, the Company would only be obligated for the products or services that the Company had received at the time the termination became effective as well as non-cancelable and non-refundable payment obligations incurred by the vendor for products or services before the termination became effective. In the case of terminating a clinical trial agreement at a particular site, the Company would also be obligated to provide continued support for appropriate medical procedures at that site until completion or termination.        15   8. Equity Incentive Plans  2015 Plan  In March 2015, the Company's board of directors adopted and in April 2015 the Company's stockholders approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2015 Plan, which became effective upon the IPO and provides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, and other forms of stock awards to its employees, directors and consultants. The Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan, terminated on the date the 2015 Plan was adopted. Options granted or shares issued under the 2009 Plan that were outstanding on the date the 2015 Plan became effective will remain subject to the terms of the 2009 Plan.  The 2015 Plan is administered by the board of directors or a committee appointed by the board of directors, which determines the types of awards to be granted, including the number of shares subject to the awards, the exercise price and the vesting schedule. The exercise price of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options will be no less than 100% of the fair value per share of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. If an individual owns capital stock representing more than 10% of the voting shares, the price of each share will be at least 110% of the fair value on the date of grant. Options expire after 10 years (five years for stockholders owning greater than 10% of the voting stock). The number of shares of common stock initially reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan was 6,134,292 shares with an automatic annual increase to the shares issuable under the 2015 Plan to the lower of (i) 4% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or (ii) a lower number determined by the board of directors. On January 1, 2016 the shares issuable under the 2015 Plan increased by 2,543,513. The Company had 6,483,623 shares available for future grant under the 2015 Plan as of June 30, 2016.  Stock option activity under the Company's stock option plan was as follows:              (1)   This excludes 34,162 canceled options for the six months ended June 30, 2016 initially granted from the legacy stock option plans. As these plans have been terminated, any options canceled are not added back to the existing option plan pool.  The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the options and the closing price of the Company's common stock. The Company's closing stock price as reported on the NASDAQ as of June 30, 2016 was $11.31. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 was $0.4 million and $3.9 million, respectively.  2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In March 2015, the Company's board of directors adopted and in April 2015 the Company's stockholders approved the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP, which became effective upon the IPO. The 2015 ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code, and is administered by the Company's board of directors and the Compensation Committee of the board of directors.  The number of shares of common stock initially reserved for issuance under the 2015 ESPP was 720,000 shares with an automatic annual increase to the shares issuable under the 2015 ESPP to the lower of (i) 1% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or (ii) a lower number determined by the board of directors. On January 1, 2016 the shares issuable under the 2015 ESPP increased by 635,878. The Company had 1,259,761 shares available for future issuance under the 2015 ESPP as of June 30, 2016.  16   Stock-based Compensation Expense  Total stock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows (in thousands):          As of June 30, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options, net of estimated forfeitures, was $33.8 million, which the Company expects to recognize over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.5 years.  In determining the fair value of the stock-based awards, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of stock option awards granted to employees was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for the six months ended June 30, 2016:             9. Income Taxes  Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $1.5 million and zero, respectively, and $4.7 million and zero for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The income tax expense recorded for the first half of 2016 primarily related to current and deferred federal income taxes.  The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 , Accounting for Income Taxes . As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, $0.2 million and zero of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the Company's annual effective tax rate because the majority of benefits are in the form of deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance has been recorded.  The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company accrued no interest and penalties in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. There were no interest and penalties included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company does not expect the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly within the next 12 months.  The Company files income tax returns in the United States and the Netherlands. The federal and state income tax returns are open under the statute of limitations subject to tax examinations for the tax years ended December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2015. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS or state tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For the Netherlands, the tax administration can impose an additional assessment within five years from the year in which the tax debt originated.          17   10. Net Income (Loss) per Common Share  Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share gives effect to dilutive stock options and warrants. The Company uses the treasury-stock method to compute diluted earnings per share with respect to its stock options and warrants. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands except share and per share amounts):          The following securities were excluded from diluted net income (loss) per common share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive:             18   
Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the "Risk Factors" section of this report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.  Forward-Looking Statements  This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as "believe," "will," "may," "estimate," "continue," "anticipate," "intend," "should," "plan," "expect," "predict," "could," "potentially" or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. You should read these statements carefully because they discuss future expectations, contain projections of future results of operations or financial condition, or state other "forward-looking" information. These statements relate to our future plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and financial performance and the assumptions that underlie these statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this report in Part II, Item 1A - "Risk Factors," and elsewhere in this report. Forward-looking statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of their date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments. We caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.  Overview  We are an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases. Our technology platforms, which are designed to harness the body's natural immune system, are being investigated in cancer indications and have the potential to expand into autoimmune and infectious diseases. Immuno-oncology is an emerging field of cancer therapy that aims to activate the immune system in the tumor microenvironment to create and enhance anti-tumor immune responses, as well as to overcome the immuno-suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells have developed against the immune system. Recent developments in the field of immuno-oncology, including checkpoint inhibitors-therapies that have mechanisms focused on unmasking hidden cancer cells-have shown the potential to provide efficacy and extended survival, even in cancers where conventional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have failed. The immunotherapy field is rapidly advancing with new immuno-oncology combinations that focus on strengthening therapeutic efficacy in a wide range of cancers. We intend to pursue a broad strategy of combining our technology platforms with conventional and novel immuno-oncology therapies, based on their mechanisms of action, safety profiles and versatility.  Our LADD (Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted) technology platform is based on proprietary attenuated strains of Listeria that have been engineered to express tumor-associated antigens to induce specific and targeted immune responses. One of our LADD product candidates, CRS-207, expresses the antigen mesothelin and is currently being developed in unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer. A second LADD agent is being evaluated in glioblastoma. We have also developed two LADD product candidates in collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, targeting prostate and lung cancers.  Our STING Pathway Activator platform is designed to activate the intracellular Stimulator of Interferon Genes, or STING receptor, resulting in a potent tumor-specific immune response. Product candidates being developed through this platform to stimulate anti-tumor immunity are being advanced under our worldwide collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis. The lead STING product candidate, ADU-S100, has entered into Phase 1 clinical testing in patients with cutaneously accessible metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas.  Our B-select monoclonal antibody platform includes a number of immune modulating assets in research and preclinical development. Agents from this platform, such as our anti-APRIL, anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1, have the potential to yield novel immunotherapy combinations. We have intellectual property protection on our LADD and STING Pathway Activator technology platforms and each of our product candidates, which we believe we will maintain into the 2030s.  19   Since commencing our operations, our efforts have been focused on research, development and the advancement of our product candidates into clinical trials. As a result we have incurred significant losses. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of common stock and convertible preferred stock, the issuance of convertible promissory notes, licensing agre ements with pharmaceutical partners and revenue from government grants. We incurred net income of $2.3 million and a net loss of $26.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a net loss of $26.5 million and $42.9 millio n for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $127.4 million.  Financial Operations Overview  Revenue  We have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our revenue to date has been primarily derived from two research and license agreements we entered into with Janssen, a collaboration and license agreement we entered into with Novartis in March 2015, as well as research and development grants from the U.S. government. We recognize revenue from upfront payments under our Janssen and Novartis agreements ratably over the term of our estimated period of performance under the agreement. In addition to receiving upfront payments, we may also be entitled to milestone and other contingent payments upon achieving predefined objectives. Revenue from milestones, if they are nonrefundable and deemed substantive, are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones. To the extent that non-substantive milestones are achieved and we have remaining performance obligations, milestones are deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated remaining period of performance. We recognize revenue related to research and development grants when the related research expenses are incurred and our specific performance obligations under the terms of the respective contracts are satisfied.  We expect that any revenue we generate from our research and license agreements with Janssen and Novartis, government research and development grants, and any future collaboration partners will fluctuate from year to year as a result of the timing and amount of milestones and other payments.  Research and Development Expenses  The largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities, including the clinical development of our product candidates. Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research, such as the discovery and development of our product candidates, as well as the development of product candidates pursuant to our research and license agreement with Janssen. We recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred. Clinical trial costs, contract manufacturing and other development costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.  We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we advance our product candidates into and through clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. The actual probability of success for our product candidates and technology platforms may be affected by a variety of factors including: the quality of our product candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical program, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses include personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services and other allocated expenses. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation. Outside professional services consist of legal, accounting and audit services, insurance expenses, investor relations activities, administrative services and other consulting fees. Allocated expenses consist of rent expense related to our office and research and development facility.  Loss from Remeasurement of Fair Value of Warrants  Loss from remeasurement of fair value of warrants consists of losses from the remeasurement of the fair value of our liabilities related to our convertible preferred stock warrants and common stock warrants.  20   Prior to the completion of our IPO in April 2015, our convertible preferred stock warrants were exercisable into shares that were contingently redeemable. Our common stock warrants were subject to pe rformance conditions that could have resulted in the issuance of a variable number of shares. As such, these warrants were classified as liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair values, and we recorded the change in the estimated fair values each reporting period as loss from remeasurement of fair value of warrants. We continued to record adjustments to the estimated fair values of the convertible preferred stock warrants until they converted into common stock warrant s upon the closing of the IPO. We also continued to record adjustments to the estimated fair value of our common stock warrants until the performance conditions lapsed in April 2015, at which time they were reclassified to additional paid-in capital.  Interest Income  Interest income consists of interest income from our cash equivalents and marketable securities.  Other (Loss) Income, Net  Other (loss) income, net, consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses.  Provision for Income Taxes  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income, the availability of research and development tax credits, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from the examination of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our income tax reserves and expense. Should actual events or results differ from our current expectations, charges or credits to our income tax expense may become necessary.  21   Results of Operations  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015          Revenue  Collaboration and license revenue was $38.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $29.3 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the receipt of $35.0 million in connection with the achievement of a milestone under our agreement with Novartis in the second quarter of 2016.  Grant revenue was $41,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $0.2 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to grants expiring in 2015.  Research and Development Expenses  The following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:          22   Research and development expenses were $27.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $13.3million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was attributed to an $8.3 million increa se in contract manufacturing expense primarily for GVAX Pancreas manufacturing activities. In addition, there was a $2.9 million increase in contract research expense primarily related to sponsored research grants made to UC Berkeley and a $1.8 million inc rease in personnel related expenses and a $1.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense due to increased headcount. This was partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in licensing fees paid in 2015.  General and Administrative Expenses  The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:          General and administrative expenses were $8.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $2.8 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to growth of the company and the associated increased expenses of $1.5 million in personnel costs and $1.3 million in outside professional services including legal, audit and tax services.  Loss from Remeasurement of Fair Value of Warrants  There was no loss from remeasurement of fair value of warrants for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $16.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. In April 2015, all of the convertible preferred stock warrants and common stock warrants were no longer subject to remeasurement due to the completion of our IPO or expiration of the performance condition and the total fair value was expensed on the statement of operations and reclassified to additional paid in capital.  Interest Income  Interest income was $0.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $0.5 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. Interest income earned in 2016 relates to interest earned from our funds invested in cash equivalents and marketable securities.  Provision for Income Taxes  Provision for income taxes was $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, primarily related to current and deferred federal income taxes. There was no provision for income taxes in the second quarter of 2015.         23   Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015       Revenue  Collaboration and license revenue was $42.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $24.1 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the receipt of $35.0 million in connection with the achievement of a milestone under our agreement with Novartis in the second quarter of 2016. This increase was partially offset by the decrease in amortization of upfront license revenue from Janssen collaborations in 2015.  Grant revenue was $88,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $0.5 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to grants expiring in 2015.  Research and Development Expenses  The following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:          24   Research and development expenses were $47.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $23.6million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributed to a $14.5 million increase in contract manufacturing expense primarily for GVAX Pancreas manufacturing activities. The increase was also attributable to a $3.4 million increase in contract research expense primarily related to sponsored research grants made to UC Berkeley, a $3.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $1.7 million increase in personnel related expenses due to increased headcount and a $1.6 million increase in clinical development expense associated with our ongoing trials in pancreatic cance r, ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. These increases were partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in licensing fees paid in 2015.  General and Administrative Expenses  The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:          General and administrative expenses were $17.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $5.6 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to continued growth of the company and the associated increased expenses of $1.9 million in personnel costs, $1.4 million in outside professional services including legal, audit and tax services and $1.1 million for the expansion of our facilities.  Loss from Remeasurement of Fair Value of Warrants  There was no loss from remeasurement of fair value of warrants for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $26.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. In April 2015, all of the convertible preferred stock warrants and common stock warrants were no longer subject to remeasurement due to the IPO or expiration of the performance condition and the total fair value was expensed on the statement of operations and reclassified to additional paid in capital.  Interest Income  Interest income was $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $1.0 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The interest income earned in 2016 relates to interest earned from our funds invested in cash equivalents and marketable securities.  Provision for Income Taxes  Provision for income taxes was $4.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily related to current and deferred federal income taxes. There was no provision for income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $396.9 million. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and anticipated funding from our collaboration agreements will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through 2018. We have based our cash sufficiency estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or in excess of amounts that we currently expect, which could adversely affect our development activities.  25   Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation a nd relat ed expenses, clinical development costs including manufacturing and other research and development services, laboratory and related supplies and legal and other professional services. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when w e pay expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of our product can didates.  We plan to continue to fund our operations and capital funding needs through equity and/or debt financing. We may also consider entering into additional collaboration arrangements or selectively partnering for clinical development and commercialization. In addition, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to the equity capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. If we are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible and/or suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.  Cash Flows  The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:          Operating Activities  Net cash used in operating activities was $25.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $173.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the upfront payment of $200.0 million received from Novartis in the first half of 2015.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities was $21.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to increase in purchase of $11.1 million of marketable securities and purchase of $10.5 million of property and equipment primarily related to leasehold improvements.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $173.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily related to $174.0 million net proceeds from the issuance of our convertible preferred stock and the IPO and private placement during the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates  Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  26   There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the thre e months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.  Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we exercised our option to lease additional space under our new lease agreement for office/laboratory space in Berkeley, California. Refer to Note 7 of the Condensed Consolidated Notes to the Financial Statements for more information. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2016:
