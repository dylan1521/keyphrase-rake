Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements        1. Organization and Nature of Business  Aduro Biotech, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, or the Company, is an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases, including cancer. The Company is located in Berkeley, California and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Aduro Biotech Holdings, Europe B.V., or Aduro Biotech Europe, is based in the Netherlands. The Company operates in one business segment.  The Company believes its three technology platforms are uniquely positioned to recruit and direct the immune system by activating cancer-fighting immune cells and inhibiting immune suppressive cells known to allow tumor growth. Product candidates from the Company's LADD, or Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted Listeria monocytogenes , STING Pathway Activator, and B-select monoclonal antibody platforms are designed to stimulate and/or regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies (chemotherapy and radiation) as well as other novel immunotherapies. The Company's diverse technology platforms have led to a strong pipeline of clinical and preclinical candidates, which are being developed for a number of cancer indications. Additionally, Aduro's platforms have the potential to generate product candidates that address other therapeutic areas, such as autoimmune and infectious diseases. The Company is also collaborating with leading global pharmaceutical companies to expand its products and technology platforms.        2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Recent Accounting Pronouncements  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and follow the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted, and accordingly the balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as our annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are necessary for a fair presentation of our financial information. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2017 or for any other interim period or for any other future year.  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2016 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aduro Biotech, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, clinical trial accruals, contingent consideration, income taxes and stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and relevant assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.        Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Auditing Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods and services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates  7      than under the currently effective guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the tr ansaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which reduce s the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Custome rs (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. The new standard permits adoption either by using (i) a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or (ii) a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard recognized at the date of initial application and providing certai n additional disclosures. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company plans to adopt the new standar d effective January 1, 2018 and has not made the decision as to which adoption method it will utilize. The Company's final determination will depend on the significance of the impact of the new standard on the Company's financial results. The Company has c ompleted the initial evaluation of the adoption of the new standard. This included the determination of whether the counterparty in its existing collaboration agreements met the definition of a customer and whether such agreements would be within the scope of the new standard. As a result, certain of the Company's collaboration agreements are in scope and the Company is currently determining the impact that these agreements may have on its financial results.  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments--Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company has evaluated the impact of this guidance and has concluded that adoption of the standard will not have a material impact onits consolidated financial statements.   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which establishes a comprehensive new lease accounting model. The new standard: (a) clarifies the definition of a lease; (b) requires a dual approach to lease classification similar to current lease classifications; and, (c) causes lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with a lease-term of more than twelve months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires modified retrospective application. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.   In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326). The standard changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. Financial assets measured at amortized cost will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected by using an allowance for credit losses. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 identifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the Statement of Cash Flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard should be applied retrospectively and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company has evaluated the impact of this guidance and has concluded that the adoption of the standard will not have a material impact onits Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. ASU 2016-18 requires that the statement of cash flows explains the change during the period in the total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. This standard should be applied retrospectively and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company plans to adopt this standard on January 1, 2018 utilizing the required retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2016-18 on January 1, 2018 will change the presentation and classification of restricted cash in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  8      In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718) : Scope of Modification Accounting. ASU 2017-09 provides clarity and reduces the complexity of applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. This standard is ef fective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.   Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. Formerly, these excess tax benefits were recognized in additional paid-in capital and tax deficiencies (to the extent there were previous tax benefits) were recognized as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits. If no previous tax benefit existed, the deficiencies were recognized in the income statement as an increase to income tax expense. The changes require all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payments be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. Gross excess tax benefits in the cash flow statement have also changed from the prior presentation as a financing activity to being classified as an operating activity. The excess tax benefits are no longer included in the assumed proceeds of the diluted EPS calculation, which results in stock-based awards being more dilutive. Lastly, the Company elected to continue to estimate forfeitures based on historical data and recognizes forfeiture compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. This standard is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2017 which resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than paid-in capital of $1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017.        3. Fair Value Measurements  The carrying amounts of certain of the Company's financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheets, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis or disclosed at fair value, are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair values. The accounting guidance for fair value provides a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about how fair value is determined. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The accounting guidance also establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based upon whether such inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions made by the reporting entity. The three-level hierarchy for the inputs to valuation techniques is briefly summarized as follows:  Level 1 -Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;  Level 2 -Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and  Level 3 -Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.  The Company's cash equivalents, which include money market funds, are classified as Level 1 because they are valued using quoted market prices. The Company's marketable securities consist of available-for-sale securities and are generally classified as Level 2 because their value is based on valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.  In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around the inputs to valuation, securities are classified as Level 3. Level 3 liabilities consist of the contingent consideration liability.  9      The following table sets forth the Company's financial instruments that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thous ands):               The acquisition-date fair value of the contingent consideration liability represents the future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified development milestones for a product candidate. The fair value of the contingent consideration is based on the Company's probability-weighted discounted cash flow assessment that considers probability and timing of future payments. The fair value measurement is based on significant Level 3 inputs such as anticipated timelines and probability of achieving development milestones. Changes in the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration, except for the impact of foreign currency, will be recognized as research and development expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations until settlement.  The Company did not have any financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. There were no transfers between the fair value measurement category levels during any of the periods presented.  The following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Company's Level 3 financial liabilities (in thousands):          10      The following tables summarize the estimated value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the gross unrealized holding gains and losses (in thousands):               The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the Company's available-for-sale marketable securities by contractual maturity are summarized below as of June 30, 2017 (in thousands):             4. Balance Sheet Components  Property and Equipment, Net  Property and equipment, net consisted of the following (in thousands):          11      Depreciation and amortization expense was $833,000 and $382,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $1.7 million and $739,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities  Accrued expenses and other liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):                5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Goodwill  The gross carrying amount of goodwill was as follows (in thousands):          Intangible assets  The gross carrying amounts and net book value of our intangible assets were as follows (in thousands):               Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. The license agreement is being amortized over a period of 20 years and the amortization expense is recorded in operating expenses. The increase in the gross carrying amount of intangible assets as of June 30, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 reflected a positive impact of foreign currency exchange which was primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.   12      Amortization expense was $136,000 and $140,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively and $268,000 and $277,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, re spectively. Based on finite-lived intangible assets recorded as of June 30, 2017, the estimated future amortization expense is as follows (in thousands):             6. Collaboration Agreements  Novartis Agreement  In March 2015, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, pursuant to which the Company is collaborating worldwide with Novartis regarding the development and potential commercialization of product candidates containing an agonist of the molecular target known as STING in the field of oncology, including immuno-oncology and cancer vaccines. Under this agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, the Company granted Novartis a co-exclusive license to develop such products worldwide, an exclusive license to commercialize such products outside the United States and a non-exclusive license to support the Company in commercializing such products in the United States if it requests such support. The collaboration is guided by a joint steering committee with each party having final decision making authority regarding specified areas of development or commercialization.  Under the Novartis Agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $200.0 million in April 2015. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company earned a $35.0 million development milestone upon initiation of a Phase 1 trial for the first STING product candidate, ADU-S100, and recognized the payment as revenue in the period. The Company is also eligible to receive up to an additional $215.0 million in development milestones and up to an additional $250.0 million in regulatory approval milestones.   The Company is responsible for 38% of the joint development costs worldwide and Novartis is responsible for the remaining 62% of the joint development costs worldwide.  The Company will also receive 50% of gross profits on sales of any products commercialized pursuant to this collaboration in the United States and 45% of gross profits for specified European countries and Japan. For each of these profit share countries, each party will be responsible for its respective commercial sharing percentage of all joint commercialization costs incurred in that country.  For all other countries where the Company is not sharing profits, Novartis will be responsible for all commercialization costs and will pay the Company a royalty in the mid-teens on all net sales of product sold by Novartis, its affiliates and sublicensees, with such percentage subject to reduction post patent and data exclusivity expiration and subject to reduction, capped at a specified percentage, for royalties payable to third party licensors. Novartis' royalty obligation will run on a country-by-country basis until the later of expiration of the last valid claim covering the product, expiration of data exclusivity for the product or 12 years after first commercial sale of the product in such country.  With respect to the United States, specified European countries and/or Japan, the Company may elect for such region to either reduce by 50% or to eliminate in full the Company's development and commercialization cost sharing obligation. If the Company elects to reduce its cost sharing percentage by 50% in any such region, then its profit share in such region will also be reduced by 50%. If the Company elects to eliminate its development cost sharing obligation, then such region will be removed from the profit share, and instead Novartis will owe the Company royalties on any net sales of product for such region, as described above.  The Company recognizes revenue from collaboration, license or research arrangements when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. The Company has determined that the license does not have stand-alone value separable from the co-development services to be performed under the agreement, with the Company participating in the research and development services. As a result, the Company recognizes revenue from the $200.0 million upfront fee received on a straight-line basis over its estimated performance period of 13.5 years, commencing in July 2015, the date of the Joint Steering Committee's approval of the research and development plan. Changes in the estimated period of performance will be accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate. The Company will recognize substantive milestone payments in their entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. Non-substantive milestone payments  13      will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining performance period. Costs associated with co-development activities performed under the agreement are included in research and development expenses in the accompanying condensed consolid ated statements of operations. Reimbursement of research and development costs by Novartis is included in collaboration and license revenue. The Company will recognize revenue from the sale of any products commercialized pursuant to this collaboration in t he United States, will retain 50% of the gross profits from such sales, and will pay the remaining 50% of the gross profits to Novartis. The Company will receive from Novartis 45% of gross profits for specified European countries and Japan. Profit sharing payments made to or received from Novartis are aggregated by product by territory and are reported as expenses or revenues, as applicable.  For the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized $3.8 million and $3.7 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized $7.5 million and $7.4 million, respectively, in revenue from its collaboration with Novartis primarily related to amortization of the upfront fee. The remaining balance of the upfront fees of $170.4 million is included in deferred revenue at June 30, 2017.  Janssen ADU-214 Agreement  In November 2014, the Company entered into a Research and License Agreement, or the Janssen ADU-214 Agreement, with Janssen Biotech Inc., or Janssen, a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson Development Corporation, to develop a drug for the treatment of lung cancer. Under the terms of the Janssen ADU-214 Agreement, the Company granted Janssen an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture, use, sell and otherwise exploit products containing ADU-214 for any and all uses. Janssen has agreed not to administer or cause to be administered ADU-214 in humans in clinical trials for the treatment of pancreatic cancer or mesothelioma. The Company was responsible for certain research and development activities from the effective date of the agreement until investigational new drug application, or IND, approval which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Since the inception of the Janssen ADU-214 Agreement through June 30, 2017, the Company received an upfront license fee of $30.0 million and substantive and non-substantive milestone payments of $21.0 million upon completion of various development activities. Under the terms of the Janssen ADU-214 Agreement, the Company is eligible to receive future contingent payments up to a total of $766.0 million composed of development milestones through completion of all Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as regulatory and commercial milestones. The contingent payments are triggered upon the activities expected to be undertaken by Janssen. The Company is eligible to receive royalties on any net sales of licensed products by Janssen, its affiliates and sublicensees at a rate ranging from high-single digits to low teens based on the aggregate annual net sales of licensed products worldwide and based on the country of sale.  The upfront license fee of $30.0 million was recognized on a straight-line basis from the effective date of the agreement through October 2015. In addition, the Company recognized milestone payments of $21.0 million in 2015 as all performance obligations were achieved.  Janssen ADU-741 and GVAX Prostate Agreements  In May 2014, the Company entered into a Research and License Agreement, or the Janssen ADU-741 Agreement, and a GVAX Prostate License Agreement, or Janssen GVAX Prostate Agreement, with Janssen to collaborate on the development of a drug for the treatment of prostate cancer. Under the terms of the Janssen ADU-741 Agreement, the Company granted Janssen an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture, use, sell and otherwise exploit products containing ADU-741 for any and all uses. The Company was responsible for certain research and development activities from the effective date of the agreement until IND approval which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Since the inception of the Janssen ADU-741 Agreement through June 30, 2017, the Company received an upfront payment of $12.0 million and substantive and non-substantive milestone payments of $10.0 million upon completion of certain development activities. Under the terms of the Janssen ADU-741 Agreement, the Company is eligible to receive future contingent payments up to a total of $343.0 million composed of development milestones through completion of all Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as regulatory and commercial milestones. The contingent payments are triggered upon the activities expected to be undertaken by Janssen. The Company is eligible to receive royalties on net sales of licensed products by Janssen, its affiliates and sublicensees at a rate ranging from mid-single digits to low teens based on aggregate annual net sales and based on the country of sale.  Under the Janssen GVAX Prostate Agreement, the Company granted Janssen an exclusive worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture, use, sell and otherwise exploit products containing GVAX Prostate for any and all uses. The Company received an upfront payment of $500,000 in May 2014 and is eligible to receive an additional $2.0 million on the achievement of a specified commercial milestone. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive royalties in the high single digits based on net sales of the product.   14      The upfront fees received totaling $12.5 mi llion were recognized on a straight-line basis from the effective date of the agreements through October 2015. In addition, the Company recognized milestone payments of $10.0 million in 2015 as all performance obligations were achieved.     Merck License Agreement  In connection with the acquisition of Aduro Biotech Europe in October 2015, the Company became party to an agreement with Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., or Merck. The agreement sets forth the parties' respective obligations for development, commercialization, regulatory and manufacturing and supply activities for antibody product candidates. The Company identified the following performance deliverables under the agreement: 1) the license, 2) the obligation to provide research activities and 3) the obligation to participate on a Joint Research Committee.   The Company is eligible to receive future contingent payments, including up to $310.0 million in potential development milestone payments, and up to $135.0 million in commercial and net sales milestones for a product candidate. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive royalties in the mid-single digits to low teens based on net sales of the product.  The Company considered the provisions of the multiple-element arrangement guidance in determining how to recognize the total consideration of the agreement. The Company determined that none of the deliverables have standalone value; all of these obligations will be delivered throughout the estimated period of performance and therefore are accounted for as a single unit of accounting.  The Company determined that all of the future contingent payments meet the definition of a milestone. Accordingly, revenue for the achievement of these milestones will be recognized in the period when the milestone is achieved and collectability is reasonably assured . The Company recognized $2.0 million in revenue from the achievement of a milestone during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.  Genmab Agreement  In February 2015, Aduro Biotech Europe entered into a co-development and commercialization agreement with Genmab to evaluate five DuoBody product candidates targeting immune checkpoints. Genmab and Aduro Biotech Europe will contribute panels of antibodies for the creation of bispecific antibody products using Genmab's DuoBody platform. If the companies jointly select a product candidate for clinical development, development costs will be shared equally, with each party retaining a 50% share of the product rights. If one of the companies decides not to move a therapeutic candidate forward, the other company is entitled to continue developing the product at predefined licensing terms. The agreement also includes terms which allow the parties to opt out of joint development at key points in each product's clinical development.        7. Commitments and Contingencies  Leases  The Company moved into its new corporate office and laboratory facility located in Berkeley, California in August, 2016. The Company's offices are leased pursuant to an Office/Laboratory Lease that was entered into in September 2015, or the Heinz Lease. The Company began incurring rent expense when the landlord delivered possession of the facility to the Company in March 2016. Initially, the Heinz Lease was for approximately 56,000 square feet with an option for the Company to lease the remainder of the space within the facility. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company amended the lease to include approximately 7,000 additional square feet and on June 30, 2016 the Company exercised its option for approximately 41,000 additional square feet, representing the remaining space within the facility. The Heinz Lease had an initial term of twelve years, which was extended to approximately thirteen and a half years as a result of the option exercised on June 30, 2016. The Company has the right to further extend the Heinz Lease term for up to two renewal terms of five years each, provided that the rental rate would be subject to market adjustment at the beginning of each renewal term.   The Company continues to lease its former office and research and development facility in Berkeley, California, under a non-cancelable operating lease, or the Bancroft Lease. In February 2015, the Company amended the Bancroft Lease agreement to increase the total square footage to approximately 25,000 square feet and extended the term of the Bancroft Lease to expire on December 31, 2018. The Bancroft Lease also contains an option to extend the lease for an additional two years. The Company has transitioned the entirety of its Berkeley operations to its Heinz facility in 2016. As of June 30, 2017 the entire facility under the Bancroft Lease has been subleased.  15      During 2016, the Company established a letter of credit with Bank of America Merrill Lynch as security for the Heinz Lease in the amount of $0.5 million. The letter of credit is collateralized by a certificate of deposit for $0.5 million which has been included in restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.   The Company also has office and laboratory space in Oss, the Netherlands, for employees of Aduro Biotech Europe. The term of the Oss lease is through December 2017, with a one-year renewal option.  Rent expense was $1.6 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $2.9 million and $1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Under the terms of the lease agreements, the Company is also responsible for certain insurance, property tax and maintenance expenses. Future minimum payments under the Company's office leases at June 30, 2017 are as follows (in thousands):          Indemnification  In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into agreements that may include indemnification provisions. Pursuant to such agreements, the Company may indemnify, hold harmless and defend an indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party. Some of the provisions will limit losses to those arising from third party actions. In some cases, the indemnification will continue after the termination of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these provisions is not determinable. The Company has never incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. The Company has also entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware corporate law. The Company currently has directors' and officers' insurance.  Legal  The Company is not party to any material legal proceedings at this time. From time to time, the Company may become involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business.  Other Commitments  The Company has various manufacturing, clinical, research and other contracts with vendors in the conduct of the normal course of its business. All contracts are terminable, with varying provisions regarding termination. If a contract with a specific vendor were to be terminated, generally the Company would only be obligated for the products or services that the Company had received at the time the termination became effective as well as non-cancelable and non-refundable obligations, including those incurred by the vendor for products or services before the termination became effective, and in some cases a termination fee. In the case of terminating a clinical trial agreement at a particular site, the Company may also be obligated to provide continued support for appropriate treatment for clinical trial subjects at that site until or after completion or termination.        8. Stockholders' Equity     At-the-Market Sales Agreement     In May 2016, the Company entered into an "at-the-market" sales agreement, or the 2016 Sales Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, through which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering of up to $100.0 million from time to time through Cowen, acting as the Company's sales agent. The issuance and sale of these shares by the Company pursuant to the 2016 Sales Agreement are deemed an "at-the-market" offering under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Under the 2016 Sales Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay Cowen a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds of any sales made pursuant to the Sales Agreement. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company received net proceeds  16      of $60.5 million after deducting commissions a nd expenses payable by the Company, from the sale of 5,823,789 shares of common stock pursuant to the 2016 Sales Agreement. Since the inception of the 2016 Sales Agreement through June 30, 2017, the Company has sold a total of 8,350,018 shares and received net total proceeds of $97.3 million. As of June 30, 2017 there were no amounts remaining for future sales under the Sales Agreement.        9. Equity Incentive Plans  2015 Plan  In March 2015, the Company's board of directors adopted and in April 2015 the Company's stockholders approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2015 Plan, which became effective upon the Initial Public Offering ("IPO") and provides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, and other forms of stock awards to its employees, directors and consultants. The Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan, terminated on the date the 2015 Plan was adopted. Options granted or shares issued under the 2009 Plan that were outstanding on the date the 2015 Plan became effective will remain subject to the terms of the 2009 Plan.  The 2015 Plan is administered by the board of directors or a committee appointed by the board of directors, which determines the types of awards to be granted, including the number of shares subject to the awards, the exercise price and the vesting schedule. The exercise price of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options will be no less than 100% of the fair value per share of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. If an individual owns capital stock representing more than 10% of the voting shares, the price of each share will be at least 110% of the fair value on the date of grant. Options expire after 10 years (five years for stockholders owning greater than 10% of the voting stock). The number of shares of common stock initially reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan was 6,134,292 shares with an automatic annual increase to the shares issuable under the 2015 Plan to the lower of (i) 4% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or (ii) a lower number determined by the board of directors. On January 1, 2017 the shares issuable under the 2015 Plan increased by 2,716,729. The Company had 6,826,585 shares available for future grant under the 2015 Plan as of June 30, 2017.  2009 Plan  The Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan, terminated on the date the 2015 Plan was adopted. Options granted or shares issued under the 2009 Plan that were outstanding on the date the 2015 Plan became effective will remain subject to the terms of the 2009 Plan. Prior to the 2009 Plan termination, the number of options available for grant was increased by 360,000 shares. At June 30, 2017, 6,649,962 options under the 2009 Plan remained outstanding.  Stock Options  The following table summarizes stock option activity for the six months ended June 30, 2017:              (1)   This excludes 10,408 canceled options for the six months ended June 30, 2017 initially granted from the legacy stock option plans. As these plans have been terminated, any options canceled are not added back to the existing option plan pool.  17      The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the options and the closing price of the Company's common stock. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 was $4.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively.     As of June 30, 2017, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options, net of estimated forfeitures, was $31.7 million, which the Company expects to recognize over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.3 years.  Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)  In September 2016, the Company's board of directors authorized the issuance of Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs, under the 2015 Plan and adopted a form of Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice and Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, or the RSU Agreement, which is intended to serve as a standard form agreement for restricted stock unit grants issued to employees, executive officers, directors and consultants.   The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity for the six months ended June 30, 2017:          The fair value of RSUs is determined on the date of grant based on the market price of the Company's common stock on that date. As of June30, 2017, there was $7.8 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to RSUs to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.3 years.   Stock-based Compensation Expense  Total stock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows (in thousands):          In determining the fair value of the stock-based awards, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of stock option awards granted to employees was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:          18      2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In March 2015, the Company's board of directors adopted and in April 2015 the Company's stockholders approved the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP, which became effective upon the IPO. The 2015 ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code, and is administered by the Company's board of directors and the Compensation Committee of the board of directors.  The number of shares of common stock initially reserved for issuance under the 2015 ESPP was 720,000 shares with an automatic annual increase to the shares issuable under the 2015 ESPP to the lower of (i) 1% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or (ii) a lower number determined by the board of directors. On January 1, 2017 the shares issuable under the 2015 ESPP increased by 679,182. The Company had 1,838,166 shares available for future issuance under the 2015 ESPP as of June 30, 2017. Under the Aduro Biotech, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") employees purchased 58,385 shares for $0.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017.     10. Income Taxes  Income tax (benefit)/expense for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $(3.8) million and $1.5 million, respectively, and $(6.5) million and $4.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The income tax benefit recorded for the first half of 2017 primarily related to the current benefit of federal income taxes paid in 2016. The income tax expense recorded in 2016, primarily related to federal current and deferred income taxes.  The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 , Accounting for Income Taxes . As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $2.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $1.1 million and $1.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the Company's annual effective tax rate because the majority of benefits are in the form of deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance has been recorded.  The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company accrued no interest and penalties in the statement of financial position. There were no interest and penalties included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The Company does not expect the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly within the next 12 months.  The Company files income tax returns in the United States and the Netherlands. The federal and state income tax returns are open under the statute of limitations subject to tax examinations for the tax years ended December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2016. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS or state tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For the Netherlands, the tax administration can impose an additional assessment within five years from the year in which the tax debt originated.        11. Net Income/Loss per Common Share  Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share gives effect to dilutive stock options and warrants. The Company uses the treasury-stock method to compute diluted earnings per share with respect to its stock options and warrants. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands except share and per share amounts):       19      Potentially dilutive securities tha t were not included in the diluted per common share calculations because they would be anti-dilutive were as follows:             20      
Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2016, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Forward-Looking Statements  This discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as "believe," "will," "may," "estimate," "continue," "anticipate," "intend," "should," "plan," "expect," "predict," "could," "potentially" or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. You should read these statements carefully because they discuss future expectations, contain projections of future results of operations or financial condition, or state other "forward-looking" information. These statements relate to our future plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and financial performance and the assumptions that underlie these statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this report in Part II, Item 1A - "Risk Factors," and elsewhere in this report. Forward-looking statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of their date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments. We caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.  Overview  We are an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases, including cancer. We believe our three technology platforms are uniquely positioned to recruit and direct the immune system by activating cancer-fighting immune cells and inhibiting immune suppressive cells known to allow tumor growth. Product candidates from our LADD, or Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted Listeria monocytogenes , STING Pathway Activator, and B-select monoclonal antibody platforms are designed to stimulate and/or regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies (i.e. chemotherapy and radiation) as well as other novel immunotherapies. Our diverse technology platforms have led to a strong pipeline of clinical and preclinical candidates, which are being developed for a number of cancer indications. Additionally, our platforms have the potential to generate product candidates that address other therapeutic areas, such as autoimmune and infectious diseases.  Immuno-oncology is an emerging field of cancer therapy that aims to activate the immune system in the tumor microenvironment to create and enhance anti-tumor immune responses, as well as to overcome the immuno-suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells have developed against the immune system. Recent developments in the field of immuno-oncology, including checkpoint inhibitors-therapies which work to remove suppression mechanisms that prevent an immune response against cancer cells-have shown the potential to provide efficacy and extended survival, even in cancers where conventional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have failed. The immunotherapy field is rapidly advancing with new immuno-oncology combinations that focus on strengthening therapeutic efficacy in a wide range of cancers. We intend to pursue a broad strategy of combining our technology platforms with conventional and novel immuno-oncology therapies, based on their mechanisms of action, safety profiles and versatility.  Our LADD technology platform is based on proprietary attenuated strains of Listeria that have been engineered to express tumor-associated antigens to induce specific and targeted immune responses. This platform is being developed as a treatment for multiple indications, including mesothelioma, ovarian, gastric, lung and prostate cancers. Additionally, a personalized form of LADD, or pLADD, is being developed utilizing tumor neoantigens that are specific to an individual patient's tumor.  Our STING Pathway Activator platform is designed to activate the intracellular Stimulator of Interferon Genes, or STING receptor, resulting in a potent tumor-specific immune response. ADU-S100 is the first STING Pathway Activator compound to enter the clinic and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 study in patients with cutaneously accessible metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas.  Our B-select monoclonal antibody platform includes a proprietary ultra-selective functional screening process to identify antibodies with unique binding properties against a broad range of targets that can modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The B-select platform has delivered a number of immune modulating assets currently in research and preclinical development.  21      We are collaborating with leading global pharmaceutical companies to expand our products and technology platforms.  We have intellectual property protection on our LADD, STING and B-select technology platforms and each of our product candidates, some of which we believe can be maintained into the 2030s.  Since commencing our operations, our efforts have been focused on research, development and the advancement of our product candidates into clinical trials. As a result we have incurred significant losses . We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of common stock and convertible preferred stock, the issuance of convertible promissory notes, licensing agreements with pharmaceutical partners and revenue from government grants. We incurred a net loss of $19.4 million and net income of $2.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a net loss of $41.2 million and $26.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $377.2 million and our accumulated deficit was $233.2 million.  Components of Operating Results  Revenue  We have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our revenue to date has been primarily derived from research and license agreements we entered into with Janssen, a collaboration and license agreement with Novartis, as well as research and development grants from the U.S. government. We recognize revenue from upfront payments under our Janssen and Novartis agreements ratably over the term of our estimated period of performance under the agreement. In addition to receiving upfront payments, we may also be entitled to milestone and other contingent payments upon achieving predefined objectives. Revenue from milestones, if they are nonrefundable and deemed substantive, are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones. To the extent that non-substantive milestones are achieved and we have remaining performance obligations, milestones are deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated remaining period of performance. We recognize revenue related to research and development grants when the related research expenses are incurred and our specific performance obligations under the terms of the respective contracts are satisfied.  We expect that any revenue we generate from our research and license agreements with Janssen and Novartis, government research and development grants, and any future collaboration partners will fluctuate from year to year as a result of the timing and amount of milestones and other payments.  Research and Development Expenses  The largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities, including the clinical development of our product candidates. Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research, such as the discovery and development of our product candidates, as well as the development of product candidates pursuant to our research and license agreements with Janssen, Novartis and Merck. We recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred. Clinical trial costs, contract manufacturing and other development costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.  We expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future as we advance our product candidates into and through clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. The actual probability of success for our product candidates and technology platforms may be affected by a variety of factors including: the quality of our product candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical program, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates.  22      The following table summarizes our research and development costs by platform:          Other research includes sponsored research grants, laboratory supplies and materials, and facility costs. Internal costs include personnel and stock compensation expenses as well as depreciation.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses include personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services and other allocated expenses. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation. Outside professional services consist of legal, accounting and audit services, insurance expenses, investor relations activities, administrative services and other consulting fees. Allocated expenses consist of rent expense related to our office and research and development facility.  Interest Income, Net  Interest income, net consists of interest income from our cash equivalents and marketable securities.  Other (Loss), Net  Other (loss), net, primarily consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses.  Provision for Income Taxes  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income, the availability of research and development tax credits, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from the examination of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our income tax reserves and expense. Should actual events or results differ from our current expectations, charges or credits to our income tax expense may become necessary.  23      Results of Operations  Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016          Revenue  Collaboration and license revenue was $5.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $33.1 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of $35.0 million in connection with the achievement of a milestone under our agreement with Novartis in the second quarter of 2016 partially offset by the recognition of $2.0 million in connection with the achievement of a milestone under our agreement with Merck in the second quarter of 2017.  Grant revenue was $41,000 for each of the three months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016.  Research and Development Expenses  The following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016:       24      Research and development expenses were $21.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $5.4million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016. Contract manufacturing decreased by $9.2 million primari ly related to GVAX Pancreas manufacturing expense and clinical trials expense in pancreatic cancer incurred during the second quarter of 2016 partially offset by increased costs to manufacture our B-select antibodies in 2017.Contract research decreased by $1.8 million primarily related to sponsored research grants made to UC Berkeley in 2016. These expenses were partially offset by an increase of $2.9 million in research and development costs related to materials and supplies for our B-select antibodies. P ersonnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, increased by $2.3 million due to increases in headcount, and facility related costs increased by $1.4 million relating to our relocation to a new office and laboratory facility in the third quarte r of 2016.  General and Administrative Expenses  The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016:          General and administrative expenses were $8.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $0.5 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in outside professional services expenses of $0.8 million partially offset by an increase in facility costs of $0.2 million following our relocation to a new office and laboratory facility in the third quarter of 2016.  Interest Income, net  Interest income was $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $0.3 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016. Interest income is earned from our funds invested in cash equivalents and marketable securities.  Provision for Income Taxes  Income tax benefit recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was approximately $3.8 million, primarily due to the current benefit of federal income taxes paid in 2016.  25      Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016       Revenue  Collaboration and license revenue was $9.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $33.3 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of $35.0 million in connection with the achievement of a milestone under our agreement with Novartis in the second quarter of 2016 partially offset by the recognition of $2.0 million in connection with the achievement of a milestone under our agreement with Merck in the second quarter of 2017.  Grant revenue was $41,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $47,000 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to most grants expiring in 2016.  Research and Development Expenses  The following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016:          26      Research and development expenses were $42.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $5.8million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributed to a $15.2 million de crease in contract manufacturing and clinical development expenses related to GVAX Pancreas manufacturing activities in early 2016. Contract research decreased by $1.3 million primarily due to sponsored research grants made to UC Berkeley in 2016. Professi onal services decreased by $1.2 million primarily due to lower consulting services incurred in 2017. These expenses were partially offset by an increase of $4.4 million in research and development costs primarily related to materials and supplies for our B -select antibodies, $4.5 million in personnel-related costs including stock based compensation due to increases in headcount, and $3.1 million in facility related costs following our relocation to a new office and laboratory facility in the third quarter o f 2016.  General and Administrative Expenses  The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016:          General and administrative expenses were $16.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $1.2 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.7 million decrease in outside professional services partially offset by higher facility costs of $0.5 million following our relocation to a new office and laboratory facility in the third quarter of 2016.   Interest Income, net  Interest income was $1.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $0.5 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest income earned in 2017 is primarily due to the favorable interest rate environment.  Provision for Income Taxes  Income tax benefit recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $6.5 million, primarily related to current and deferred federal income taxes.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of June 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $377.2 million. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and anticipated funding from our collaboration agreements will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into 2020. We have based our cash sufficiency estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or in excess of amounts that we currently expect, which could adversely affect our development activities.  Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, clinical development costs including manufacturing and other research and development services, laboratory and related supplies and legal and other professional services. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of our product candidates.  We plan to continue to fund our operations and capital funding needs through equity and/or debt financing and potential milestones from existing collaboration agreements. We may also consider entering into additional collaboration arrangements or selectively partnering for clinical development and commercialization. In addition, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to the equity capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. The sale of additional equity would result in  27      additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments gove rning such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to ou r technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. If we are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible and/or suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condit ion and future prospects.  Cash Flows  The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:          Operating Activities  Net cash used in operating activities was $44.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $25.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily related to the collection of a $35 million milestone from Novartis that offset operating expenses to a greater extent during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Investing Activities  Net cash provided by investing activities was $91.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net cash used by investing activities of $21.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The change was primarily due to the decrease in purchases of marketable securities in 2017 compared to 2016.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities was $61.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $3.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily related to $60.5 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of our common stock through the Sales Agreement with Cowen during the six months ended June 30, 2017.  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates  Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods.
