Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  (unaudited)    1.   Organization, Basis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Pronouncements    2U,Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated as 2TorInc. in the State of Delaware in April2008 and changed its name to 2U,Inc. on October11, 2012. Under long-term agreements, the Company provides an integrated solution comprised of cloud-based software-as-a-service ( SaaS ), fused with technology-enabled services (together, the  Platform ), that allows leading colleges and universities to deliver high-quality digital degree programs, extending the universities  reach and distinguishing their brands. The Company s SaaS technology consists of (i)a comprehensive learning environment ( Online Campus ), which acts as the hub for all student and faculty academic and social interaction, and (ii)a comprehensive suite of integrated applications, which the Company uses to launch, operate and support the Company s clients  programs. The Company also provides a suite of technology-enabled services optimized with data analysis and machine learning techniques that support the complete lifecycle of a higher education program, including attracting students, advising prospective students through the admissions application process, providing technical, success coaching and other support, facilitating accessibility to individuals with disabilities, and facilitating in-program field placements.    Basis of Presentation    The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with: (i)generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S.GAAP ) for interim financial information; (ii)the instructions to Form10-Q; and (iii)the guidance of Rule10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for financial statements required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). They include the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, including its wholly owned subsidiaries. As permitted under such rules, certain notes and other financial information normally required by GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The Company believes the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the Company s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the periods presented herein. The Company s results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 may not be indicative of the Company s future results. These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.    The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from the audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.    Reclassifications    Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation.    Use of Estimates    The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S.GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported herein. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements    In November2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No.2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. The ASU requires companies to explain the changes in the combined total of restricted and unrestricted cash balances in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is retrospective to each prior period presented. The Company early adopted this ASU in the second quarter of 2017. Adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the presentation of prior periods.    In August2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No.2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice surrounding how certain transactions are classified in    7           the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that this standard will have on its consolidated statements of cash flows and related disclosures.    In March2016, the FASB issued ASU No.2016-09, Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The ASU simplifies various aspects related to the accounting and presentation of share-based payments. The guidance also allows employers to withhold shares to satisfy minimum statutory withholding requirements up to the employees  maximum individual tax rate without causing the award to be classified as a liability. Additionally, the guidance stipulates that cash paid by an employer to a taxing authority when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows, and allows companies to elect an accounting policy to either estimate the share-based award forfeitures (and expense) or account for forfeitures (and expense) as they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2017. In connection with the adoption of this standard, the Company elected to no longer apply an estimated forfeiture rate and will instead account for forfeitures as they occur. Accordingly, the Company applied the modified retrospective adoption approach, which resulted in a $0.1 million cumulative-effect reduction to retained earnings with an offset to additional paid-in-capital.    In February2016, the FASB issued ASU No.2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The ASU introduces a model for lessees requiring most leases to be reported on the balance sheet. Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current U.S. GAAP. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that this ASU will have on its consolidated financial position and related disclosures, and believes that this standard may materially increase its other non-current assets and non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets in order to record right-of-use assets and related liabilities for its existing operating leases.    In August2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-15,Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The ASU requires that an entity s management evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods ending afterDecember15, 2016. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2017. Adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial reporting process.    In May2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S.GAAP when it becomes effective. In July2015, the FASB deferred the mandatory effective date of this ASU by one year from January1, 2017 to January1, 2018. Early application is permitted, but not prior to the original effective date of January1, 2017. Subsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU No.2014-09: ASU No.2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations; ASU No.2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing; ASU No.2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients; and ASU No.2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company must adopt ASU No.2016-08, ASU No.2016-10, ASU No.2016-12 and ASU No.2016-20 with ASU No.2014-09 (collectively, the  new revenue standard ). The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company has assembled a multidisciplinary team that includes independent third-party consultants to assist with the implementation of the new revenue standard and has made progress with its assessment of the impact of the new revenue standard during the second quarter of 2017. While the Company has not completed its assessment of the impact of adopting the new revenue standard, the Company is in the process of reviewing the current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that could result from applying the requirements of the new revenue standard to its revenue contracts and expects to complete the assessment effort by the end of the third quarter of 2017. Over the second half of 2017, the Company will complete the quantification of any identified impacts, the evaluation and implementation of any necessary changes to its business processes and controls in order to support revenue recognition and disclosure under the new revenue standard, and the determination of which transition approach will be applied. The Company will provide additional updates on progress made and further conclusions in its third quarter report on Form 10-Q to be filed in 2017, and adopt the new revenue standard on January 1, 2018.    8           2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    Concentration of Credit Risk    Financial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. All of the Company s cash is held at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality. The Company s bank accounts exceed federally insured limits at times. The Company has not experienced any losses on cash to date. To manage accounts receivable risk, the Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, if needed.    During the three months ended June30, 2017, four clients each accounted for 10% or more of the Company s revenue, as follows: $19.1 million, $12.1 million, $6.9 million and $6.8 million, which equals 29%, 19%, 11% and 10% of total revenue, respectively.    During the three months ended June30, 2016, three clients each accounted for 10% or more of the Company s revenue, as follows: $17.6 million, $9.1 million and $5.1 million, which equals 36%, 18% and 10% of total revenue, respectively.    During the six months ended June30, 2017, four clients each accounted for 10% or more of the Company s revenue, as follows: $38.8 million, $23.8 million, $13.8 million and $13.2 million, which equals 30%, 18%, 11% and 10% of total revenue, respectively.    During the six months ended June30, 2016, three clients each accounted for 10% or more of the Company s revenue, as follows: $35.5 million, $16.9 million and $10.2 million, which equals 37%, 17% and 11% of total revenue, respectively.    As of June30, 2017, two clients each accounted for 10% or more of the Company s accounts receivable balance, as follows: $14.1 million and $5.3 million, which equals 61% and 23% of total accounts receivable, respectively. As of December31, 2016, two clients each accounted for 10% or more of the Company s accounts receivable balance, as follows: $5.8 million and $1.4 million, which equals 74% and 17% of total accounts receivable, respectively.    Restricted Cash    Restricted cash includes a 1.2 billion South African rand denominated restricted cash balance at June 30, 2017, which was held in connection with the Company s acquisition of GetSmarter on July 1, 2017, as further discussed in Note 10 below.    Non-cash Investing and Financing Activities    During the six months ended June30, 2017, the Company had new capital asset additions of $31.6 million, which was comprised of $15.6 million of leasehold improvements, $10.5 million in capitalized technology and content development costs and $5.5 million of other property and equipment. The $31.6 million increase consisted of $26.3 million in cash capital expenditures, with the remainder primarily comprised of landlord funded leasehold improvements.    During the six months ended June30, 2016, the Company had new capital asset additions of $9.1 million, which was primarily comprised of capitalized technology and content development costs. The increase consisted almost entirely of cash capital expenditures.    Government Grants    Government grants awarded to the Company in the form of forgivable loans are recorded as deferred government grant obligations within long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets until all contingencies are resolved and the grant is determined to be realized.    Comprehensive Loss    The Company s net loss equals comprehensive loss for all periods presented as the Company has no material components of other comprehensive income.    3.   Capitalized Technology and Content Development Costs    Capitalized technology and content development costs consisted of the following as of:       9           Amortization expense related to capitalized technology was $0.8 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization expense related to capitalized technology was $1.5 million and $1.0 million for the six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.    The Company re corded amortization expense related to capitalized content development costs of $1.8 million and $1.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company recorded amortization expense related to capitalized content development costs of $3.5 million and $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.    As of June30, 2017, the estimated future amortization expense for the capitalized technology and content development costs placed in service is as follows (in thousands):       4.   Commitments and Contingencies    Legal Contingencies    From time to time, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings or other contingencies in the ordinary course of its business. The Company is not presently involved in any legal proceeding or other contingency that, if determined adversely to it, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Accordingly, the Company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss exceeding amounts already recognized may have been incurred as of the date of the balance sheets presented herein.    Operating Leases    The Company leases office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases in Maryland, New York, California, Colorado, North Carolina, Virginia and Hong Kong. In February 2017, the Company signed a lease for new office space in Brooklyn, New York, which is expected to be occupied beginning in 2018. The lease covers three floors totaling approximately 80,000 square feet, requires total future minimum lease payments of approximately $51.8 million and will expire approximately eleven years and nine months after the July 1, 2017 lease commencement date. Related to this lease, the Company could be eligible for certain state and local incentives that are dependent on construction build, employment levels, the Company s taxable income and other factors. The Company is in the process of applying for such eligibility, but is not currently able to assess the potential benefit these incentives may yield over the lease term. The Company also leases office equipment under non-cancelable leases.    Fixed Payments to Clients    The Company is contractually obligated to make fixed payments to certain of its clients in exchange for contract extensions and various marketing and other rights. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company entered into new agreements with certain of its clients for contract extensions and various marketing and other rights that, as of June 30, 2017, require future fixed payments totaling $4.8 million, the majority of which were paid in July 2017.    10           5.   Debt    Line of Credit    In June2017, the Company and Comerica amended its credit agreement for a $25.0 million revolving line of credit pursuant to which, among other things, Comerica consented to the Company s acquisition of GetSmarter and the Company s formation of certain subsidiaries in connection therewith, and the parties extended the maturity date through July31, 2017. On July31, 2017, the Company further amended its credit agreement to extend the maturity date through September29, 2017. No amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement as of June30, 2017 or December31, 2016. The Company intends to extend this agreement under comparable terms, prior to expiration.    Certain of the Company s operating lease agreements entered into prior to June30, 2017 require security deposits in the form of cash or an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit. As of June30, 2017, the Company has entered into standby letters of credit totaling $11.5 million as security deposits for the applicable leased facilities. Additionally, in June2017, the Company entered into standby letters of credit totaling $3.5 million in connection with two government grants, as described later in this Note. These letters of credit reduced the aggregate amount the Company may borrow under its revolving line of credit to $10.0 million.    Government Grants    On June22, 2017, the Company executed a conditional loan agreement and received financing from Prince George s County, Maryland that provides for a grant in the form of a forgivable loan of $1.5 million. The financing was secured by a letter of credit pursuant to the Company s line of credit with Comerica Bank. The conditional loan obligation is recorded as  Deferred government grant obligations  on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The proceeds from this loan are to be used in connection with the relocation of 2U s headquarters, leasehold improvements thereto and other purposes. The loan has a maturity date of June 22, 2027, and bears interest at a rate of 3% per annum. If 2U does not employ at least 650 employees at its Lanham headquarters at any time during the term of the loan period or otherwise defaults on the loan, the entire principal balance, plus accrued interest, will become due and payable. If 2U does not employ at least 1,300 employees at its Lanham headquarters by January1, 2020, the Company will be required to repay a prorated portion of the loan ($2,252 per employee, for every employee below 1,300), plus interest.    On June27, 2017, 2U Harkins Road LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) executed a loan agreement and received financing from the Department of Commerce (a principal department of the State of Maryland) that provides for a grant in the form of a forgivable loan of $2.0 million. The financing was secured by a letter of credit pursuant to the Company s line of credit with Comerica Bank. The conditional loan obligation is recorded as  Deferred government grant obligations  on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The proceeds from this loan are to be used in connection with the relocation of 2U s headquarters, leasehold improvements thereto and other purposes. The loan has a maturity date of December31, 2026, and bears interest at a rate of 3% per annum. If 2U does not employ at least 650 employees at its Lanham headquarters at any time during the term of the loan period or otherwise defaults on the loan, the entire principal balance, plus accrued interest, will become due and payable. If 2U does not employ at least 1,600 employees at its Lanham headquarters by December31, 2020, and at each December31 st  thereafter through 2026, the Company will be required to repay a prorated portion of the loan ($2,105 per employee, for every employee below 1,600), plus interest.    6 .   Stockholders  Equity    As of June30, 2017, the Company was authorized to issue 205,000,000 total shares of capital stock, consisting of 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. At June30, 2017, the Company had reserved a total of 10,988,222 of its authorized shares of common stock for future issuance as follows:       The Compensation Committee of the Company s board of directors, acting under authority delegated from the board of directors, granted in July2017 option awards to employees to purchase an aggregate of 34,019 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $46.32 and restricted stock unit awards for an aggregate of 132,507 shares of common stock, in each case under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (as defined in Note 7 below).    7.   Stock-Based Compensation    The Company provides equity-based compensation awards to employees, independent contractors and directors as an effective means for attracting, retaining and motivating such individuals. The Company maintains two share-based compensation plans: the 2014    11           Equity Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ) and the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2008 Plan ). Upon the effective date of the 2014 Plan in January2014, the Company ceased using the 2008 Plan to grant new equity awards and began using the 2014 Plan for grants of new equity awards.    The number of shares of the Company s common stock that may be issued under the 2014 Plan will automatically increase on January1stof each year, for a period of ten years, from January1, 2015 continuing through January1, 2024, by 5% of the total number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding on December31stof the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares as may be determined by the Company s board of directors. The shares available for issuance increased by 2,357,579 and 2,288,820 on January1, 2017 and 2016, respectively, pursuant to the automatic share reserve increase provision under the 2014 Plan.    Stock-Based Compensation Expense    Stock-based compensation expense related to stock-based awards is included in the following line items in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations:       Stock Options    The Company values stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected life of the option, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. Prior to June30, 2017, expected volatility was based on historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected life of the stock options. Effective June 30, 2017, expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of 2U common stock over the estimated expected life of the stock options.    The following table summarizes the assumptions used for estimating the fair value of the stock options granted for the periods presented.       The following is a summary of the stock option activity for the six months ended June30, 2017:       12           The total compensation cost related to the nonvested options not yet recognized as of June30, 2017 was $18.8million and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5years.    The aggregate intrinsic value of the options exercised during the six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 was $8.6million and $10.5million, respectively.    Restricted Stock Units    The following is a summary of restricted stock unit activity for the six months ended June30, 2017:       The total compensation cost related to the nonvested restricted stock units not yet recognized as of June30, 2017 was $33.3million and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.6years.    Employee Stock Purchase Plan    On June5, 2017, 2U s stockholders voted upon and approved the Company s 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ). The ESPP provides for (i)consecutive six-month offering periods (commencing each January1 and July1) and (ii)that the purchase price for shares of 2U common stock purchased under the ESPP will not be less than 85% of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the purchase date. The Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors may exercise its discretion, subject to certain conditions, to determine that the purchase price will be 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of 2U s common stock on the purchase date or the fair market value of 2U s common stock on the first day of the offering period. The first offering period is expected to begin on January1, 2018, and will end on June30, 2018. Eligible employees will be able to select a rate of payroll deduction between 1% and 15% of their salary or wage compensation received from the Company as in effect at the start of the offering period, subject to a maximum payroll deduction per calendar year of $25,000. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code. A maximum of 1,000,000 shares of 2U s common stock may be issued under the ESPP, subject to adjustments for certain capital transactions.    8.   Net Loss per Share    Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share for all periods presented because the effects of potentially dilutive items were anti-dilutive, given the Company s net loss. The following securities have been excluded from the calculation of weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding because the effect is anti-dilutive for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016:       Basic and diluted net loss per share is calculated as follows:       13           9.   Segment and Geographic Information    Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company s CODM reviews the financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company s operations constitute a single operating segment and one reportable segment. The Company offers similar services to substantially all of its clients, which primarily represent well-recognized nonprofit colleges and universities in the United States. Substantially all assets were held and all revenue was generated in the United States during all periods presented, with the exception of a 1.2 billion South African rand denominated restricted cash balance at June30, 2017, which was held in connection with the Company s acquisition of GetSmarter, as further discussed in Note 10 below.    10.   Subsequent Events    On July1, 2017, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary ( 2U South Africa ), completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of GetSmarter pursuant to a Share Sale Agreement, dated as of May1, 2017 (the  Share Sale Agreement ), as amended by an Addendum, dated as of June29, 2017, for a purchase price of approximately $103.0 million in cash. The purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Share Sale Agreement. In addition, 2U South Africa agreed to pay a potential earn out payment of up to $20.0 million, subject to the achievement of certain financial milestones in calendar years 2017 and 2018. Under the terms of the Share Sale Agreement, 2U has issued restricted stock units for shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company to certain employees and officers of GetSmarter.These awards are subject to the 2014 2U,Inc. Equity Incentive Plan and will vest over either a two (2)or four (4)year period.As a result of the transaction, GetSmarter became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.    14

This suite of technology tightly integrated with technology-enabled services, optimized with data analysis and machine learning techniques, provides a comprehensive set of capabilities that would otherwise require the purchase of multiple, disparate point solutions, and allows our clients  programs to expand and operate at scale, providing the comprehensive infrastructure colleges and universities need to attract, enroll, educate, support and graduate their students.    Our Business Model    The key elements of our business model are described below.    Revenue Drivers and Predictability    Substantially all of our revenue is derived from revenue-share arrangements with our clients, under which we receive a contractually specified percentage of the amounts students pay them in tuition and other fees. Accordingly, the primary driver of our revenue growth is the increase in the number of student course enrollments in our clients  programs. This in turn is influenced primarily by three factors:       our ability to increase the number of programs offered by our clients, either by adding new clients or by expanding the number of client programs;       our ability to identify and acquire prospective students for our clients  programs; and       our ability, and that of our clients, to retain the students who enroll in their programs.    In the near term, we expect the primary drivers of our financial results to continue to be our first two programs with the University of Southern California, which are our longest running programs, which we launched in 2009 and 2010, and our programs with Simmons College, which launched between 2013 and 2016. For the three months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, 29% and 36%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from the first two University of Southern California programs. For the three months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, 19% and 18%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from the Simmons College programs. For the six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, 29% and 37%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from the first two University of Southern California    15           programs. For the six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, 18% and 17%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from the Simmons College programs. We expect that the first two programs with the University of Southern California and our programs with Simmons College will continue to account for a large portion of our revenue even though that portion should decline as other client programs become more mature and achieve higher enrollment levels.    Program Marketing and Sales Expense    Our most significant expense in each fiscal period has been program marketing and sales expense, which relates primarily to student acquisition activities. We have primary responsibility for identifying qualified students for our clients  programs, generating potential student interest in the programs and driving applications to the programs. While our clients make all admissions decisions, the number of students who enroll in our clients  programs in any given period is significantly dependent on the amount we have spent on these student acquisition activities in prior periods. Accordingly, although most of our clients  programs span multiple academic terms and, therefore, generate continued revenue beyond the term in which initial enrollments occur, we expect that we will need to continue to incur significant program marketing and sales expense for existing programs going forward to generate a continuous pipeline of new enrollments. For new programs, we begin incurring program marketing and sales costs as early as nine months prior to the start of a new client program.    We typically identify prospective students for our clients  programs between three months and two or more years before they ultimately enroll. For the students currently enrolled in our clients  programs and those who have graduated, the average time from our initial prospective student acquisition to initial enrollment was approximately seven months. For the students who have graduated from these programs, the average time from initial enrollment to graduation was 22months. Based on the student retention rates and patterns we have observed in our clients  programs, we estimate that, for our current programs, the average time from a student s initial enrollment to graduation will be approximately twoyears.    Accordingly, our program marketing and sales expense in any period is an investment we make to generate revenue in future periods. Likewise, revenue generated in any period is largely attributable to the investment made in student acquisition activities in earlier periods. Because program marketing and sales expense in any period is almost entirely unrelated to revenue generated in that period, we do not believe it is meaningful to directly compare the two. We believe that the total revenue we will receive over time related to students who enroll in our clients  programs as a result of current period program marketing and sales expense, will be significantly greater as a multiple of that current period expense than is implied by the multiple of current period revenue to current period program marketing and sales expense as expressed in our financial statements. Further, we believe that our program marketing and sales expense in future periods will generally decline as a percentage of the revenue reported in those same periods as our revenue base from returning students in existing programs increases.    We continually manage our program marketing and sales expense to ensure that across our portfolio of client programs, our cost to acquire students for these programs is appropriate for our business model. We use a ratio of attrition adjusted lifetime revenue of a student, or LTR, to the total cost to acquire that student, or TCA, as the measure of our marketing efficiency and to determine how much we are willing to spend to acquire an additional student for any program. The calculations included in this ratio include certain assumptions. For any period, we know what we spent on program sales and marketing and therefore, can accurately calculate the ratio s denominator. However, given the time lag between when we incur our program marketing and sales expense and when we receive revenue related to students enrolled based on that expense, we have to incorporate forecasts of student enrollments and retention into our calculation of the ratio s numerator, which is our estimate of future revenue related to that period s expense. We use the significant amount of data we have on the effectiveness of various marketing channels, student attrition and other factors to inform our forecasts and are continually testing the assumptions underlying these forecasts against actual results to give us confidence that our forecasts are reasonable. The LTR to TCA ratio may vary from program to program depending on the degree being offered, where that program is in its lifecycle and whether we enable the same or similar degrees at other universities.    Period-to-Period Fluctuations    Our revenue, cash position, accounts receivable and deferred revenue can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to variations driven by the academic schedules of our clients  programs. These programs generally start classes for new and returning students an average of four times per year. Classstarts are not necessarily evenly spaced throughout the year, do not necessarily correspond to the traditional academic calendar and may vary from year to year. As a result, the number of classes our client programs have in session, and therefore the number of students enrolled, will vary from month to month and quarter to quarter, leading to variability in our revenue.    Our clients  programs often have academic terms that straddle two fiscal quarters. Our clients generally pay us when they have billed tuition and specified fees to their students, which is typically early in the academic term, and once the drop/add period has passed. We recognize the related revenue ratably over the course of the academic term, beginning on the first day of classes through the last.    16           Because we generally receive payments from our clients prior to our ability to recognize the majority of those amounts as revenue, we record deferred revenue at each balance sheet date equal to the excess of the amounts we have billed or received from our clients over the amounts we have recognized as revenue as of that date. For these reasons, our cash flows typically vary considerably from quarter to quarter and our cash position, accounts receivable and deferred revenue typically fluctuate between quarterly balance sheet dates.    Our expense levels also fluctuate from quarter to quarter, driven primarily by our program marketing and sales activity. We typically reduce our paid search and other program marketing and sales efforts during late Novemberand Decemberbecause these efforts are less productive during the holiday season. This generally results in lower total program marketing and sales expense during the fourth quarter. In addition, because we begin spending on program marketing and sales, and, to a lesser extent, services and support as much as nine months prior to the start of classes for a new client program, these costs as a percentage of revenue fluctuate, sometimes significantly, depending on the timing of new client programs and anticipated program launch dates.    Components of Operating Results and Results of Operations    Second Quarter 2017 Highlights       Revenue was $65.0 million, an increase of 32.3% from $49.1 million in the second quarter of 2016.     Net loss was $(11.8) million, or $(0.25) per share, compared to $(8.3) million or $(0.18) per share, in the second quarter of 2016.     Adjusted EBITDA loss was $(1.5) million, compared to $(2.1) million in the second quarter of 2016.    Revenue    Substantially all of our revenue consists of a contractually specified percentage of the amounts our clients bill to their students for tuition and fees, less credit card fees and other specified charges we have agreed to exclude in certain of our client contracts, which we refer to as net program proceeds. Most of our contracts have 10 to 15 year initial terms. We recognize revenue ratably over the service period, which we define as the first through the last day of classes for each academic term in a client s program.    We establish a refund allowance for our share of tuition and fees ultimately uncollected by our clients.    In addition to providing access to our SaaS technology, we provide technology-enabled services that support the complete lifecycle of a higher education program, including attracting students, advising prospective students through the admissions application process, providing technical, success coaching and other support, facilitating accessibility to individuals with disabilities and facilitating in-program field placements. We have determined that no individual deliverable has standalone value upon delivery and, therefore, the multiple deliverables within our arrangements do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting. Accordingly, we consider all deliverables to be a single unit of accounting and we recognize revenue from the entire arrangement over the term of the service period.    We generally receive payments from our clients early in each academic term, prior to completion of the service period. We record these advance payments as deferred revenue until the services are delivered or until our obligations are otherwise met, at which time we recognize the revenue. As of each balance sheet date, deferred revenue is a current liability and represents the excess amounts we have billed or received over the amounts we have recognized as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations as of that date.    Revenue for the three months ended June30, 2017 was $65.0 million, an increase of $15.9 million, or 32.3%, from $49.1 million for the same period of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a 27.0% increase in period-over-period full course equivalent enrollments in our client programs, from 18,823 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 to 23,903 for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Of the increase in full course equivalent enrollments, 971, or 19.1%, were attributable to client programs launched during the 12 months ended June 30, 2017.    Revenue for the six months ended June30, 2017 was $129.8 million, an increase of $33.3 million, or 34.5%, from $96.5 million for the same period of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a 30.7% increase in period-over-period full course equivalent enrollments in our client programs, from 36,532 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 47,760 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Of the increase in full course equivalent enrollments, 1,779, or 15.8%, were attributable to client programs launched during the 12 months ended June 30, 2017.    Costs and Expenses    Costs and expenses consist of servicing and support costs, technology and content development costs, program marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses. To support our anticipated growth, we expect to continue to hire new employees    17           (which will increase both our cash and non-cash stock-based compensation costs), increase our program promotion and student acquisition efforts, expand our technology infrastructure and increase our other program support capabilities. As a result, we expect our costs and expenses to increase in absolute dollars, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we achieve economies of scale through the expansion of our business.    Non-cash stock-based compensation expense is a component of compensation cost within each of the four cost and expense categories described above. In early 2014, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved a framework for granting equity awards under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. Under this framework, the majority of our equity awards are made on or around April 1 of each year and typically have four-year vesting periods. As such, non-cash stock-based compensation expense is expected to continue to increase year-over-year until four years after the initial early-2014 grants.    Servicing and support.  Servicing and support expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash stock-based compensation costs related to program management and operations, as well as costs for technical support for our SaaS technology and faculty and student support. It includes costs to facilitate in-program field placements, student immersions and other student enrichment experiences and costs to assist our clients with their state compliance requirements. It also includes software licensing, telecommunications and other costs to provide access to our SaaS technology for our clients and their students.    Servicing and support costs for the three months ended June30, 2017 were $13.5million, an increase of $3.2million, or 31.2%, from $10.3million for the same period of 2016. This increase was due primarily to higher cash compensation costs of $1.5 million, as we increased our headcount in this area by 9% to serve a growing number of students and faculty in existing and new client programs. Additionally, $1.1 million of the increase related to student immersion courses and on-campus initiatives, in-program field placements, rent expense and travel and related expenses. The remainder of the increase in servicing and support costs related to other costs to support our program marketing efforts. As a percentage of revenue, servicing and support costs decreased from 20.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 to 20.7% for the same period of 2017, as revenue grew at a higher rate than the increase in expense.    Servicing and support costs for the six months ended June30, 2017 were $24.4million, an increase of $4.6million, or 23.3%, from $19.8million for the same period of 2016. This increase was due primarily to higher cash compensation costs of $2.9 million, as we increased our headcount in this area by 10% to serve a growing number of students and faculty in existing and new client programs. Additionally, $0.9 million of the increase related to student immersion courses and on-campus initiatives, in-program field placements, rent expense and travel and related expenses. The remainder of the increase in servicing and support costs related to other costs to support our program marketing efforts. As a percentage of revenue, servicing and support costs decreased from 20.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 18.8% for the same period of 2017, as revenue grew at a higher rate than the increase in expense.    Technology and content development.  Technology and content development expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash stock-based compensation and outsourced services costs related to the ongoing improvement and maintenance of our SaaS technology, and the developed content for our client programs. It also includes the costs to support our internal infrastructure, including our cloud-based server usage. Additionally, it includes the associated amortization expense related to capitalized technology and content development costs, as well as hosting and other costs associated with maintaining our SaaS technology in a cloud environment.    Technology and content development costs for the three months ended June30, 2017 were $11.1million, an increase of $2.3million, or 26.0%, from $8.8million for the same period of 2016. This increase was due primarily to higher amortization expense associated with our capitalized technology and content development costs of $0.8 million, due to the larger number of courses that have been developed for our client programs. Additionally, cash compensation costs (net of amounts capitalized for technology and content development) and travel and related expenses increased $0.8 million, as we increased our headcount in this area by 24% to support the launch of new client programs and the scaling of existing programs. The remainder of the increase related to cloud-based hosting services, non-cash stock-based compensation costs and other technology and content development costs. As a percentage of revenue, technology and content development costs decreased from 18.0% for the three months ended June30, 2016 to 17.1% for the same period of 2017, as revenue grew at a higher rate than the increase in expense.    Technology and content development costs for the six months ended June30, 2017 were $20.3million, an increase of $4.2million, or 26.2%, from $16.1million for the same period of 2016. This increase was due primarily to higher amortization expense associated with our capitalized technology and content development costs of $1.6 million, due to the larger number of courses that have been developed for our client programs. Additionally, cash compensation costs (net of amounts capitalized for technology and content development) and travel and related expenses increased $1.5 million, as we increased our headcount in this area by 28% to support the launch of new client programs and the scaling of existing programs. The remainder of the increase in technology and content development costs related to cloud-based hosting services and other technology and content development costs. As a percentage of revenue, technology and content development costs decreased from 16.7% for the six months ended June30, 2016 to 15.7% for the same period of 2017, as revenue grew at a higher rate than the increase in expense.    18           Program marketing and sales.  Program marketing and sales expense consists primarily of costs related to student acquisition. This includes the cost of online advertising and prospective student generation, as well as cash and non-cash stock-based compensation costs for our program marketing, search engine optimization, marketing analytics and admissions application counseling personnel. We expense all costs related to program marketing and sales as they are incurred.    Program marketing and sales expense for the three months ended June30, 2017 was $37.2million, an increase of $9.7million, or 35.5%, from $27.5million for the same period of 2016. This increase was due primarily to higher direct internet marketing costs to acquire students for our clients  programs of $5.9 million. Additionally, cash compensation costs and travel and related expenses increased by $2.6 million, as we increased our headcount in this area by 19% to acquire students for, and drive revenue growth in, new client programs. The remainder of the increase in program marketing and sales expense primarily related to depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, rent expense and other costs to support our programs marketing efforts. As a percentage of revenue, program marketing and sales expense increased from 55.9% for the three months ended June30, 2016 to 57.4% for the same period of 2017, reflecting a higher year-over-year percentage increase in revenue than the increase in expense.    Program marketing and sales expense for the six months ended June30, 2017 was $71.9million, an increase of $20.8million, or 40.6%, from $51.1million for the same period of 2016. This increase was due primarily to a $13.6 million increase in direct internet marketing costs to acquire students for our clients  programs. Additionally, cash compensation costs and travel and related costs were $5.0 million higher, as we increased our headcount in this area by 22% to acquire students for, and drive revenue growth in, new client programs. The remainder of the increase in program marketing and sales expense primarily related to depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, rent expense and other costs to support our programs marketing efforts. As a percentage of revenue, program marketing and sales expense increased from 52.9% for the three months ended June30, 2016 to 55.4% for the same period of 2017, reflecting a higher year-over-year percentage increase in revenue than the increase in expense.    General and administrative.  General and administrative expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash stock-based compensation costs for employees in our executive, administrative, finance and accounting, legal, communications and human resources functions. Additional expenses include external legal, accounting and other professional fees, telecommunications charges and other corporate costs such as insurance and travel that are not related to another function.    General and administrative expense for the three months ended June30, 2017 was $13.9 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 27.3%, from $10.9 million for the same period of 2016. This increase was due primarily to higher cash compensation costs of $2.2 million and an additional $1.0 million in non-cash stock-based compensation costs as we increased our headcount in this area by 16% to support our growing business. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other general and administrative expenses. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense decreased from 22.3% for the three months ended June30, 2016 to 21.4% for the same period of 2017, reflecting a higher year-over-year percentage increase in revenue than the increase in expense.    General and administrative expense for the six months ended June30, 2017 was $27.6 million, an increase of $6.2 million, or 29.0%, from $21.4 million for the same period of 2016. This increase was due primarily to higher cash compensation costs of $3.1 million and non-cash stock-based compensation costs of $1.0 million as we increased our headcount in this area by 18% to support our growing business. Additionally, consulting and other professional services expenses increased by $1.7 million, primarily driven by our acquisition of GetSmarter and the integration of our enterprise resource planning system. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense decreased from 22.2% for the six months ended June30, 2016 to 21.3% for the same period of 2017, reflecting a higher year-over-year percentage increase in revenue than the increase in expense.    Other Income (Expense)    Other income (expense) consists of interest income, interest expense and other expenses. Interest income is derived from interest received on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense consists primarily of the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our line of credit.    Total other income (expense) for the three months ended June30, 2017 was an expense of $1.0million, a change of $1.1million, from other income of $0.1million for the same period of 2016. This change was driven primarily by a $1.0 million foreign currency    19           translation loss recorded on a South African rand denominated restricted cash balance held in connection with the acquisition of GetSmarter.    Total other income (expense) for the six months ended June30, 2017 was an expense of $0.8million, a change of $0.9million, from other income $0.1million for the same period of 2016. This change was driven primarily by a $1.0 million foreign currency translation loss recorded on a South African rand denominated restricted cash balance held in connection with the acquisition of GetSmarter.    Income Tax (Expense) Benefit    Income tax expense consists of U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes. To date, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal income taxes because of our current and accumulated net operating losses. We incurred immaterial state and foreign income tax liabilities for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016.    Consolidated Statements of Operations as a Percentage of Revenue    The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated.       Key Business and Financial Performance Metrics    We use a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. In addition to adjusted EBITDA, which we discuss below, we discuss revenue and the components of loss from operations in the section above entitled   Components of Operating Results and Results of Operations.  Additionally, we utilize other key metrics to evaluate the success of our growth strategy, including measures we refer to as platform revenue retention rate and full course equivalent enrollments in our clients  programs.    Platform Revenue Retention Rate    We measure our platform revenue retention rate for a particular period by first identifying the group of programs that our clients launched with our solutions before the beginning of the prior year comparative period. We then calculate our platform revenue retention rate by comparing the revenue we recognized for this group of programs in the reporting period to the revenue we recognized for the same group of programs in the prior year comparative period, expressed as a percentage of the revenue we recognized for the group in the prior year comparative period.    The following table sets forth our platform revenue retention rate for the periods presented, as well as the number of programs included in the platform revenue retention rate calculation. For all of these periods, our platform revenue retention rate was greater than 100% because we had no programs terminate and full course equivalent enrollments in the aggregate increased year-over-year. There is no direct correlation between the platform revenue retention rate and the number of programs included in the calculation of that rate. However, there may be a correlation between the platform revenue retention rate and the average maturity of the programs included in the calculation of that rate because newer programs tend to have higher percentage growth rates.    20               (1)  Reflects the number of programs operating both in the reported period and in the prior year comparative period.    Full Course Equivalent Enrollments in Our Clients  Programs    We measure full course equivalent enrollments in our clients  programs by determining, for each of the courses offered during a particular period, the number of students enrolled in that course multiplied by the percentage of the course completed during that period. We use this metric to account for the fact that many courses offered by our clients straddle two or more fiscal quarters. For example, if a course had 25 enrolled students and 40% of the course was completed during a particular period, we would count the course as having 10 full course equivalent enrollments for that period. Any individual student may be enrolled in more than one course during a period.    Average revenue per full course equivalent enrollment represents our weighted-average revenue per course across the mix of courses being offered in our client programs during a period. This number is derived by dividing our total revenue for a period by the number of full course equivalent enrollments during that same period. This amount may vary from period to period depending on the academic calendars of our clients, the relative growth rates of programs with varying tuition levels, the launch of new programs with higher or lower than average net tuition costs and annual tuition increases instituted by our clients. As a part of our growth strategy, we are actively targeting new graduate-level clients in academic disciplines for which we have existing programs. Over time, this strategy is likely to reduce our average revenue per full course equivalent. However, we believe this approach will enable us to leverage our program marketing investments across multiple client programs within specific academic disciplines, significantly decreasing student acquisition costs within those disciplines and more than offsetting any decline in average revenue per full course equivalent enrollment.    The following table sets forth the full course equivalent enrollments and average revenue per full course equivalent enrollment in our clients  programs for the periods presented.       Adjusted EBITDA    Adjusted EBITDA represents our earnings before net interest income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, foreign currency gains or losses and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.    Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S.GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S.GAAP. In addition, adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate adjusted EBITDA in the same manner as we do. We prepare adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense, which we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance.    Our use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S.GAAP. Some of these limitations are:    21              although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;       adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;       adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;       adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and       other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.    Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside other U.S.GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss) and our other U.S. GAAP results. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:       Liquidity and Capital Resources    Sources of Liquidity    In June2017, we amended our credit agreement with Comerica for a $25.0 million revolving line of credit pursuant to which, among other things, Comerica consented to our acquisition of GetSmarter and our formation of certain subsidiaries in connection therewith, and we extended the maturity date through July31, 2017. On July31, 2017, we further amended our credit agreement to extend the maturity date through September29, 2017. No amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement as of June30, 2017 or December 31, 2016.    Certain of our operating lease agreements entered into prior to June30, 2017 require security deposits in the form of cash or an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit. As of June30, 2017, we have entered into standby letters of credit totaling $11.5 million, as security deposits for the applicable leased facilities and totaling $3.5 million in connection with government grants. These letters of credit reduced the aggregate amount we may borrow under our revolving line of credit to $10.0 million.    Under this revolving line of credit, we have the option of borrowing funds subject to (i)a base rate, which is equal to 1.5% plus the greater of Comerica Bank s prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 1% or the 30day LIBOR plus 1%, or (ii)LIBOR plus 2.5%. For amounts borrowed under the base rate, we may make interest-only payments quarterly, and may prepay such amounts with no penalty. For amounts borrowed under LIBOR, we may make interest-only payments in periods of one, two and three months and will be subject to a prepayment penalty if we repay such borrowed amounts before the end of the interest period.    Borrowings under the line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. The availability of borrowings under this credit line is subject to our compliance with reporting and financial covenants, including, among other things, that we achieve specified minimum three-month trailing revenue levels during the term of the agreement and specified minimum six-month trailing profitability levels for some of our client programs, measured quarterly. In addition, we are required to maintain a minimum adjusted quick ratio, which measures our short-term liquidity, of at least 1.10 to 1.00. As of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016, our adjusted quick ratios were 2.07 and 5.43, respectively.    22           The covenants under the line of credit also place limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to prepay permitted indebtedness, grant liens on or security interests in our assets, carry out mergers and acquisitions, dispose of assets, declare, make or pay dividends, make capital expenditures in excess of specified amounts, make investments, loans or advances, enter into transactions with our affiliates, amend or modify the terms of our material contracts, or change our fiscal year. If we are not in compliance with the covenants under the line of credit, after any opportunity to cure such non-compliance, or we otherwise experience an event of default under the line of credit, the lenders may require repayment in full of all principal and interest outstanding.
