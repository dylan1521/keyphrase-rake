NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (In thousands, except per share amounts) 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of ADTRAN , Inc. and its subsidiaries (ADTRAN) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting on Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements are not included herein. The December 31, 2014 Consolidated Balance Sheet is derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature. The results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed on February 24, 2015 with the SEC. Changes in Classifications We reclassified $2.3 million from other receivables to accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 to conform to the current period presentation. Out of Period Adjustment In connection with the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded corrections of certain out of period, immaterial misstatements that occurred in prior periods, the most significant of which resulted in an increase in Other Expense of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2015. The aggregate impact of the corrections was a $0.8 million reduction to pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and is not expected to be material to the current year annual results. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Our more significant estimates include the obsolete and excess inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred revenue components of multiple element sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred revenues, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments, and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition , including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. We are currently evaluating the transition method that will be elected and the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 7 In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-05, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (ASU 2015-05), which provides guidance on accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or retrospectively. We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2015-05 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (ASU 2015-11) . Currently, Topic 330, Inventory, requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. ASU2015-11 does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. ASU 2015-11 requires an entity to measure in scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2015-05 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 2. INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rate increased from 31.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 36.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the release of a valuation allowance attributable to a foreign subsidiary in 2014, partially offset by settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes in 2015. 3. PENSION BENEFIT PLAN We maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. The following table summarizes the components of net periodic pension cost for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014: 8 4. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, which was recognized as follows: The fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. There were no options granted during the three months ended September 30, 2014. The weighted-average assumptions and value of options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014 are as follows: The fair value of our RSUs is calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. No RSUs were granted or vested during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. Twelve thousand RSUs were forfeited during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The fair value of restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. No restricted stock was granted or forfeited during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. Two thousand shares of restricted stock vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 is based on options, RSUs and restricted stock ultimately expected to vest, and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures for stock options are based upon historical experience and approximate 3.3% annually. We estimated a 0% forfeiture rate for our RSUs and restricted stock due to the limited number of recipients and historical experience for these awards. 9 As of September 30, 2015, total compensation expense related to non-vested stock options, RSUs and restricted stock not yet recognized was approximately $10.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.4 years. The following table is a summary of our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 and the changes that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015: The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the closing price of our stock on the last trading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on September 30, 2015. The aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of our stock. The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $4 thousand and $0.1 million, respectively. 10 5. INVESTMENTS At September 30, 2015, we held the following securities and investments, recorded at either fair value or cost. At December 31, 2014, we held the following securities and investments, recorded at either fair value or cost. 11 As of September 30, 2015, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, and government bonds had the following contractual maturities: Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Our investment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total investment portfolio. At September 30, 2015, we held a $30.0 million restricted certificate of deposit, which is carried at cost. This investment serves as a collateral deposit against the principal amount outstanding under loans made to ADTRAN pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond). At September 30, 2015, the estimated fair value of the Bond using a level 2 valuation technique was approximately $30.1 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard and Poor s credit rating of AAA. For more information on the Bond, see Debt under Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 2 of Part I of this report. We review our investment portfolio for potential other-than-temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% or more for six or more consecutive months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, other-than-temporary impairment charges were not significant. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method. The following table presents gross realized gains and losses related to our investments. As of September 30, 2015 and 2014, gross unrealized losses related to individual securities in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant. 12 We have categorized our cash equivalents held in money market funds and our investments held at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique for the cash equivalents and investments as follows: Level 1 - Values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market; Level 2 - Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; Level 3 - Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs include information supplied by investees. 13 The fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each security. Our municipal variable rate demand notes have a structure that implies a standard expected market price. The frequent interest rate resets make it reasonable to expect the price to stay at par. These securities are priced at the expected market price. 6. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. When appropriate, we enter into various derivative transactions to enhance our ability to manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. Our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, and accordingly, all changes in the fair value of the instruments are recognized as other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The maximum contractual period for our derivatives is currently less than twelve months. Our derivative instruments are not subject to master netting arrangements and are not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2015, we had forward contracts outstanding with notional amounts totaling 7.1 million ($8.0 million), which mature in the fourth quarter of 2015. 14 The fair values of our derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were as follows: The change in the fair values of our derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: 7. INVENTORY At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, inventory consisted of the following: We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, raw materials reserves totaled $16.3 million and $16.9 million, respectively, and finished goods inventory reserves totaled $8.3 million and $7.8 million, respectively. 8. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill, all of which relates to our acquisition of Bluesocket, Inc. and is included in our Enterprise Networks division, was $3.5 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test will be performed. There have been no impairment losses recorded since acquisition. Intangible assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and include intangibles acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions of Objectworld Communications Corporation on September 15, 2009, Bluesocket, Inc. on August 4, 2011, and the NSN BBA business on May 4, 2012. 15 The following table presents our intangible assets as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014: Amortization expense, all of which relates to business acquisitions, was $0.5 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $1.5 million and $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of September 30, 2015, the estimated future amortization expense of our intangible assets is as follows: 9. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY A summary of the changes in stockholders equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is as follows: Stock Repurchase Program Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased 3.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.69 per share. As of September 30, 2015, we have the authority to purchase an additional 5.8 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors. 16 Stock Option Exercises We issued 0.1 million shares of treasury stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $22.53. We received proceeds totaling $0.9 million from the exercise of these stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Dividend Payments During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we paid cash dividends as follows (in thousands except per share amounts): Other Comprehensive Income Other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, reclassification adjustments for amounts included in net income related to impairments of available-for-sale securities, realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, and amortization of actuarial gains (losses) related to our defined benefit plan, defined benefit plan adjustments, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The following tables present changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, by component for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014: 17 The following tables present changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, by component for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014: 18 The following tables present the details of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014: (1) Included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following tables present the details of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014: (1) Included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 19 The following table presents the tax effects related to the change in each component of other comprehensive income for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014: The following table presents the tax effects related to the change in each component of other comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014: 20 10. EARNINGS PER SHARE A summary of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 is as follows: Anti-dilutive options to purchase common stock outstanding were excluded from the above calculations. Anti-dilutive options totaled 6.0 million and 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 6.1 million and 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 11. SEGMENT INFORMATION We operate in two reportable segments: (1) the Carrier Networks Division and (2) the Enterprise Networks Division. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on gross profit; therefore, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, interest and dividend income, interest expense, net realized investment gain/loss, other income/expense and provision for taxes are reported on an entity-wide basis only. There are no inter-segment revenues. The following tables present information about the reported sales and gross profit of our reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. Asset information by reportable segment is not reported, since we do not produce such information internally. 21 Sales by Product Our three major product categories are Carrier Systems, Business Networking and Loop Access. Carrier Systems products are used by communications service providers to provide data, voice, and video services to consumers and enterprises. This category includes the following product areas and related services: Broadband Access Total Access 5000 Series of Multi-Service Access Node (MSAN) hiX 5600 Series of MSANs Total Access 1100/1200 Series of Fiber to the Node (FTTN) products hiX 1100 Series of Fiber to the Node (FTTN) products VDSL2 Vectoring based Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) products ADTRAN 500 Series of FTTdp G.fast Distribution Point Units (DPU) Optical Optical Networking Edge (ONE) NetVanta 8000 Series of Fiber Ethernet Access Devices (EAD) NetVanta 8400 Series of 10Gig Multi-service Edge Switches OPTI-6100 and Total Access 3000 optical Multi-Service Provisioning Platforms (MSPP) Pluggable Optical Products, including SFP, XFP, and SFP+ Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) systems Business Networking products provide access to communication services and facilitate the delivery of cloud connectivity and enterprise communications to the small and mid-sized enterprise (SME) market. This category includes the following product areas and related services: Internetworking products Total Access IP Business Gateways Optical Network Terminals (ONTs) Bluesocket virtual Wireless LAN (vWLAN ) NetVanta Access Routers Enterprise Session Border Controllers (eSBC) Managed Ethernet Switches IP Business Gateways Unified Communications (UC) solutions Carrier Ethernet Network Terminating Equipment (NTE) Carrier Ethernet Routers and Gateways Network Management Solutions Loop Access products are used by carrier and enterprise customers for access to copper-based communications networks. This category includes the following product areas and related services: High bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line (HDSL) products Digital Data Service (DDS) Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) products T1/E1/T3 Channel Service Units/Data Service Units (CSUs/DSUs) TRACER fixed-wireless products 22 The table below presents sales information by product category for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014: In addition, we identify subcategories of product revenues, which we divide into core products and legacy products. Our core products consist of Broadband Access and Optical products (included in Carrier Systems), and Internetworking products (included in Business Networking). Our legacy products include HDSL products (included in Loop Access) and other products not included in the aforementioned core products. The table below presents subcategory revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014: 12. LIABILITY FOR WARRANTY RETURNS Our products generally include warranties of 90 days to ten years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $8.7 million and $8.4 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 23 A summary of warranty expense and write-off activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 is as follows: 13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During 2014, we employed the law firm of our director emeritus for legal services. All bills for services rendered by this firm were reviewed and approved by our Chief Financial Officer. We believe that the fees for such services were comparable to those charged by other firms for services rendered to us. The services of our director emeritus ended with his death on September 7, 2014. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, we incurred fees of $10 thousand and $70 thousand, respectively, for these legal services. 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent claims, disputes over contract agreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek damages or other relief, such as royalty payments related to patents, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. Although the outcome of any claim or litigation can never be certain, it is our opinion that the outcome of all contingencies of which we are currently aware will not materially affect our business, operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of September 30, 2015, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. 15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On October 13, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 29, 2015. The payment date will be November 12, 2015. The quarterly dividend payment will be approximately $4.5 million. In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. 24 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. OVERVIEW ADTRAN, Inc. is a leading global provider of networking and communications equipment. Our solutions enable voice, data, video and Internet communications across a variety of network infrastructures. These solutions are deployed by some of the world s largest service providers, distributed enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses, public and private enterprises, and millions of individual users worldwide. Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors. An important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then lower the product s selling price based on the cost savings achieved in order to gain market share and/or improve gross margins. As a part of this strategy, we seek in most instances to be a high-quality, low-cost provider of products in our markets. Our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign, allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation. This strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers, while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers. Our three major product categories are Carrier Systems, Business Networking and Loop Access. Carrier Systems products are used by communications service providers to provide data, voice, and video services to consumers and enterprises. This category includes the following product areas and related services: Broadband Access Total Access 5000 Series of Multi-Service Access Node (MSAN) hiX 5600 Series of MSANs Total Access 1100/1200 Series of Fiber to the Node (FTTN) products hiX 1100 Series of Fiber to the Node (FTTN) products VDSL2 Vectoring based Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) products ADTRAN 500 Series of FTTdp G.fast Distribution Point Units (DPU) Optical Optical Networking Edge (ONE) NetVanta 8000 Series of Fiber Ethernet Access Devices (EAD) NetVanta 8400 Series of 10Gig Multi-service Edge Switches OPTI-6100 and Total Access 3000 optical Multi-Service Provisioning Platforms (MSPP) Pluggable Optical Products, including SFP, XFP, and SFP+ Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) systems 25 Business Networking products provide access to communication services and facilitate the delivery of cloud connectivity and enterprise communications to the small and mid-sized enterprise (SME) market. This category includes the following product areas and related services: Internetworking products Total Access IP Business Gateways Optical Network Terminals (ONTs) Bluesocket virtual Wireless LAN (vWLAN ) NetVanta Access Routers Enterprise Session Border Controllers (eSBC) Managed Ethernet Switches IP Business Gateways Unified Communications (UC) solutions Carrier Ethernet Network Terminating Equipment (NTE) Carrier Ethernet Routers and Gateways Network Management Solutions Loop Access products are used by carrier and enterprise customers for access to copper-based communications networks. This category includes the following product areas and related services: High bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line (HDSL) products Digital Data Service (DDS) Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) products T1/E1/T3 Channel Service Units/Data Service Units (CSUs/DSUs) TRACER fixed-wireless products In addition, we identify subcategories of product revenues, which we divide into core products and legacy products. Our core products consist of Broadband Access and Optical products (included in Carrier Systems) and Internetworking products (included in Business Networking). Our legacy products include HDSL products (included in Loop Access) and other products not included in the aforementioned core products. Many of our customers are migrating their networks to deliver higher bandwidth services by utilizing newer technologies. We believe that products and services offered in our core product areas position us well for this migration. As a result of this migration, revenues of our legacy products, including HDSL, have decreased significantly. Despite occasional increases, we anticipate revenues of our legacy products, including HDSL, will continue to decline over time. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information regarding these product categories. Sales were $158.1 million and $461.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to $162.9 million and $486.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Product revenues for our three core areas, Broadband Access, Optical and Internetworking, were $146.0 million and $427.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to $148.4 million and $444.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Our gross margin decreased to 44.7% and 44.3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 from 48.0% and 50.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Our operating income margin decreased to 5.1% and 2.3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 from 7.7% and 8.9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Net income was $7.1 million and $12.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $11.3 million and $35.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Our effective tax rate increased to 35.0% and 36.9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 from 24.8% and 31.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.14 and $0.25 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $0.21 and $0.63 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. 26 Our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past, and may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors, including customer order activity and backlog. Backlog levels vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other factors that affect customer order lead times. Many of our customers require prompt delivery of products. This requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand. If near-term demand for our products declines, or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated, our financial results could be adversely affected. Operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter. Our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate movements, increased competition, customer order patterns, changes in product and services mix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs and announcements of new products by us or our competitors. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Also, not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements, which may negatively impact our operating results in a given quarter. Accordingly, our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and, in general, management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period. A list of factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results is included under Factors That Could Affect Our Future Results in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 2 of Part I of this report. These factors have also been discussed in more detail in Item 1A of Part I in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed on February 24, 2015 with the SEC. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed significantly from those detailed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed on February 24, 2015 with the SEC. EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 COMPARED TO THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 SALES ADTRAN s sales decreased 3.0% from $162.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $158.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased 5.1% from $486.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $461.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a $2.4 million decrease in sales of our HDSL and other legacy products and a $2.0 million decrease in sales of our Broadband Access products. The decrease in sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to an $11.1 million decrease in sales of our Internetworking products, a $7.9 million decrease in sales of our HDSL and other legacy products, and a $6.3 million decrease in sales of our Broadband Access products. 27 Carrier Networks sales decreased 1.3% from $133.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $131.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased 3.0% from $394.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $382.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to decreases in sales of our Broadband Access products and sales of our HDSL and other legacy products, partially offset by an increase in sales of our Internetworking products. The decrease in sales of our Broadband Access products is primarily attributable to decreased sales in the EMEA region and the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. The decrease in sales of HDSL and other legacy products has been expected as customers continue to upgrade their networks to deliver higher bandwidth services by migrating to newer technologies, including to our core products from our Broadband Access, Internetworking and Optical product lines. While we expect that revenues from HDSL and our other legacy products will continue to decline over time, these revenues may fluctuate and continue for years because of the time required for our customers to transition to newer technologies. The increase in sales of Internetworking products for this division is primarily attributable to increased sales of our FTTP ONT products. Enterprise Networks sales decreased 10.4% from $29.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $26.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased 14.3% from $91.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $78.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to decreases in sales of our Internetworking products. The decrease in sales of our Internetworking products for this division was primarily attributable to weakness in our IP gateway product segment. Internetworking product sales attributable to Enterprise Networks were 93.8% and 93.6% of the division s sales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to 93.4% and 94.2% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Legacy products primarily comprise the remainder of Enterprise Networks sales. Enterprise Networks sales as a percentage of total sales decreased from 18.4% and 18.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 17.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. International sales, which are included in the Carrier Networks and Enterprise Networks amounts discussed above, decreased 40.0% from $64.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $38.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased 22.3% from $197.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $153.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. International sales, as a percentage of total sales, decreased from 39.5% and 40.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 24.4% and 33.3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in international sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales in the EMEA region and the Asia-Pacific region, partially offset by an increase in sales in Latin America. The decrease in international sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales in the EMEA region, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. The decrease in sales in the EMEA region is primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Carrier System product sales decreased $2.9 million from $114.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $111.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased $11.8 million from $342.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $330.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a $2.0 million decrease in Broadband Access product sales and a $1.0 million decrease in legacy product sales. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a $6.3 million decrease in Broadband Access product sales and a $5.9 million decrease in legacy product sales. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are primarily attributable to the factors discussed above. Business Networking product sales decreased $0.6 million from $39.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $39.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased $10.9 million from $119.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $108.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a $0.5 million decrease in Internetworking product sales. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to an $11.1 million decrease in Internetworking product sales. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are primarily attributable to the factors discussed above. 28 Loop Access product sales decreased $1.3 million from $9.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $7.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased $2.3 million from $24.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $21.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a $1.0 million decrease in HDSL product sales. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a $1.6 million decrease in HDSL product sales. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are primarily attributable to the factors discussed above. COST OF SALES As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 52.0% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to 55.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased from 50.0% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 55.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, growth in our service-related sales in the U.S. market, and customer mix. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, growth in our service-related sales in the U.S. market, and product mix. Carrier Networks cost of sales, as a percent of division sales, increased from 53.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to 57.5% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased from 51.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 58.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, growth in service-related sales in our U.S. market, customer mix, and customer price movements to achieve market share position. Enterprise Networks cost of sales, as a percent of division sales, remained consistent at 44.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, and increased from 43.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 43.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to the shift in product and services mix. An important part of our strategy is to reduce the product cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product s price based on the cost savings achieved. This may cause variations in our gross profit percentage due to timing differences between the recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 7.5% from $32.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $30.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased 7.0% from $100.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $93.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to decreases in compensation expense and travel expense, partially offset by restructuring charges. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to decreases in compensation expense, legal expense, and independent contractor expense, partially offset by restructuring charges. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 19.9% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to 19.0% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased from 20.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 20.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared. 29 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Research and development expenses decreased 2.3% from $33.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $32.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased 1.0% from $99.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $100.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation expense, partially offset by restructuring charges and an increase in engineering and testing expense. These restructuring charges were primary attributable to the consolidation of engineering resources. The increase in research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to restructuring charges and an increase in engineering and testing expense, partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased from 20.5% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to 20.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased from 20.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 21.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities or a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared. We expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products and our expansion into international markets. We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development efforts which provides for new product development, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group. INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME Interest and dividend income decreased 15.4% from $1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $0.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased 19.8% from $3.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $2.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decreases in interest and dividend income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are primarily attributable to a reduction in investment principal. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, and $0.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and $0.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information on our revenue bond. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN Net realized investment gain decreased 23.3% from $2.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $2.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased 16.8% from $7.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $8.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in realized investment gains for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to decreased gains from the sale of equity securities. The increase in realized investment gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to increased gains from the sale of equity securities in the first two quarters of 2015. See Investing Activities in Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET Other income (expense), net, comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, investment account management fees, and scrap raw material sales, changed from $1.0 million of expense in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $0.1 million of income in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and changed from $1.6 million of expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $0.8 million of expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to gains on foreign currency transactions during the third quarter of 2015. 30 INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rate increased from 31.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 36.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the release of a valuation allowance attributable to a foreign subsidiary in 2014, partially offset by settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes in 2015. NET INCOME As a result of the above factors, net income decreased $4.3 million from $11.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $7.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased $22.4 million from $35.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $12.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. As a percentage of sales, net income decreased from 7.0% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to 4.5% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased from 7.3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 2.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, the cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. At September 30, 2015, cash on hand was $83.7 million and short-term investments were $42.1 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $125.8 million. At December 31, 2014, our cash on hand of $73.4 million and short-term investments of $46.9 million resulted in available short-term liquidity of $120.4 million. The increase in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2014 to September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a reallocation of our investments to provide additional funds for our short-term cash needs, which includes operating activities, capital expenditures, purchase of treasury stock, and shareholder dividends. Operating Activities Our working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, decreased 0.9% from $232.1 million as of December 31, 2014 to $229.9 million as of September 30, 2015. The quick ratio, defined as cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and net accounts receivable, divided by current liabilities, decreased from 1.75 as of December 31, 2014 to 1.67 as of September 30, 2015. The current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, decreased from 2.95 as of December 31, 2014 to 2.81 as of September 30, 2015. The changes in our working capital, quick ratio and current ratio are primarily attributable to increases in cash and inventory, and a decrease in unearned revenue, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in short-term investments. Net accounts receivable decreased 2.6% from $88.5 million at December 31, 2014 to $86.2 million at September 30, 2015. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.1 million at December 31, 2014 and $21 thousand at September 30, 2015. Quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased from 57 days as of December 31, 2014 to 50 days as of September 30, 2015. The change in net accounts receivable is due to changes in customer mix and the timing of sales and collections during the quarter. Certain international customers can have longer payment terms than U.S. customers. Other receivables decreased from $33.3 million at December 31, 2014 to $20.9 million at September 30, 2015. The decrease in other receivables is primarily attributable to the timing of filing returns and collections of VAT receivables in our international subsidiaries. Other receivables will also fluctuate due to the timing of shipments and collections for materials supplied to our contract manufacturers during the quarter. 31 Quarterly inventory turnover stayed consistent at 3.5 turns as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015. Inventory increased 16.1% from December 31, 2014 to September 30, 2015. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to services activity and seasonal cycles of our business, ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory obsolescence that may occur due to rapidly changing technology and customer demand. Accounts payable increased 23.0% from $56.4 million at December 31, 2014 to $69.4 million at September 30, 2015. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of supplies, inventory and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases. Investing Activities Capital expenditures totaled approximately $7.8 million and $8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase manufacturing and test equipment and computer software and hardware. Our combined short-term and long-term investments decreased $81.0 million from $327.6 million at December 31, 2014 to $246.6 million at September 30, 2015. This decrease reflects the impact of our cash needs for capital expenditures, share repurchases, and dividends, as well as net realized and unrealized losses and amortization of net premiums on our combined investments, partially offset by additional funds available for investment provided by our operating activities and stock option exercises by our employees. We invest all available cash not required for immediate use in operations primarily in securities that we believe bear minimal risk of loss. At September 30, 2015 these investments included corporate bonds of $86.8 million, municipal fixed-rate bonds of $52.1 million, asset-backed bonds of $5.5 million, mortgage/agency-backed bonds of $8.4 million, and government bonds of $14.3 million. At December 31, 2014, these investments included corporate bonds of $111.3 million, municipal fixed-rate bonds of $127.8 million, and municipal variable rate demand notes of $2.5 million. As of September 30, 2015, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, and government bonds were classified as available-for-sale and had a combined duration of 1.2 years with an average credit rating of A. Because our bond portfolio has a high quality rating and contractual maturities of a short duration, we are able to obtain prices for these bonds derived from observable market inputs, or for similar securities traded in an active market, on a daily basis. Our long-term investments decreased 27.1% from $280.6 million at December 31, 2014 to $204.5 million at September 30, 2015. Long-term investments at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $30.0 million, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond. See Debt below for additional information. We have various equity investments included in long-term investments at a cost of $29.5 million and $26.4 million, and with a fair value of $32.6 million and $38.3 million, at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Long-term investments at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 also included $15.5 million and $16.3 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans, and $1.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of other investments carried at cost, consisting of interests in two private equity funds and an investment in a privately held telecommunications equipment manufacturer. We review our investment portfolio for potential other-than-temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% or more for six or more consecutive months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, other-than-temporary impairment charges were not significant. 32 Financing Activities Dividends In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we paid dividends totaling $14.0 million. Debt We have amounts outstanding under loans made pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond) which totaled $30.0 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014. At September 30, 2015, the estimated fair value of the Bond was approximately $30.1 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard &amp; Poor s credit rating of AAA. Included in long-term investments are restricted funds in the amount of $30.0 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, which is a collateral deposit against the principal amount of the Bond. We have the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. The Bond matures on January 1, 2020, and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under this program. We are required to make payments in the amounts necessary to pay the interest on the amounts currently outstanding. It is our intent to make annual principal payments in addition to the interest amounts that are due. In connection with this decision, $1.2 million of the Bond has been classified as a current liability in accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2015. Stock Repurchase Program Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 45.0 million shares of our common stock. On July 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock (bringing the total shares authorized for repurchase to 50.0 million), which will commence upon completion of the repurchase plan announced on May 14, 2014. This new authorization will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased 3.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.69 per share. As of September 30, 2015, we have the authority to purchase an additional 5.8 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors. Stock Option Exercises To accommodate employee stock option exercises, we issued 0.1 million shares of treasury stock for $0.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, there have been no material changes in contractual obligations and commercial commitments from those discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 filed on February 24, 2015 with the SEC. We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of September 30, 2015, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. 33 FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS The following are some of the risks that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements: Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price. Our revenue for a particular period can be difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results. General economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. Our exposure to the credit risks of our customers and distributors may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable. We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products in order to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology. Our products may not continue to comply with evolving regulations governing their sale, which may harm our business. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable environmental regulations could adversely impact our results of operations. If our products do not interoperate with our customers networks, installations may be delayed or cancelled, which could harm our business. The lengthy approval process required by major and other service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue. We engage in research and development activities to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development efforts who may focus on more leading edge development. We depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenues and net income. Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards. Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and key components may prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and operating results. We compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, shipment volumes, field service obligations and other rework costs incurred in correcting product failures. If our estimates change, the liability for warranty obligations may be increased or decreased, impacting future cost of goods sold. Managing our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory. The continuing growth of our international operations could expose us to additional risks, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our success depends on our ability to reduce the selling prices of succeeding generations of our products. Breaches in our information systems could cause significant damage to our business and reputation. Our failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality, and commercial value of our products. Software under license from third parties for use in certain of our products may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. We may incur liabilities or become subject to litigation that would have a material effect on our business. Consolidation and deterioration in the competitive service provider market could result in a significant decrease in our revenue. We depend on distributors who maintain inventories of our products. If the distributors reduce their inventories of these products, our sales could be adversely affected. 34 If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with system integrators, service providers, and enterprise value added resellers, our sales may be negatively affected. If we fail to manage our exposure to worldwide financial and securities markets successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted. Changes in our effective tax rate or assessments arising from tax audits may have an adverse impact on our results. We are required to periodically evaluate the value of our long-lived assets, including the value of intangibles acquired and goodwill resulting from business acquisitions. Any future impairment charges required may adversely affect our operating results. Our success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel. Regulatory and potential physical impacts of climate change and other natural events may affect our customers and our production operations, resulting in adverse effects on our operating results. While we believe our internal control over financial reporting is adequate, a failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as our business expands could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price. The price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The foregoing list of risks is not exclusive. For a more detailed description of the risk factors associated with our business, see Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed on February 24, 2015 with the SEC.ITEM 1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of ADTRAN , Inc. and its subsidiaries (ADTRAN) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting on Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements are not included herein. The December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet is derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature. The results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on February 24, 2016 with the SEC. Out of Period Adjustment In connection with the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded corrections of certain out of period, immaterial misstatements that occurred in prior periods, the most significant of which resulted in an increase in Other Expense of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2015. The aggregate impact of the corrections was a $0.8 million reduction to pre-tax income for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and was not material to the prior year quarterly or annual results. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Our more significant estimates include the obsolete and excess inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred revenue components of multiple element sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred revenues, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments, and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition , including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. We are currently evaluating the transition method that will be elected and the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 7 In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (ASU 2015-11) . Currently, Topic 330, Inventory, requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. ASU 2015-11 does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. ASU 2015-11 requires an entity to measure in scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2015-05 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17). ASU 2015-17 amends the existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance may be applied either prospectively, for all deferred tax assets and liabilities, or retrospectively to all periods presented. We have not selected a transition method or determined whether to early adopt ASU 2015-17 in 2016. Other than the revised balance sheet presentation of current deferred tax assets and liabilities, we do not believe the adoption of ASU 2015-17 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity s leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective approach is required. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including income tax effects, the classification of tax-related cash flows on the statement of cash flows, and accounting for forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted the following accounting standards, which had no material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows: In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-05, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (ASU 2015-05), which provides guidance on accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or retrospectively. We adopted ASU 2015-05 during the first quarter of 2016 and will apply the new standard prospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-05 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 8 2. INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rate decreased from 39.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to 37.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the research and development tax credit being made permanent. 3. PENSION BENEFIT PLAN We maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. The following table summarizes the components of net periodic pension cost for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015: 4. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, which was recognized as follows: The fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. 9 There were no options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The weighted-average assumptions and value of options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2015 were as follows: The fair value of our RSUs is calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. No RSUs were granted or vested during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. Twelve thousand RSUs were forfeited during the three months ended March 31, 2015. The fair value of restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. No restricted stock vested or was forfeited during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. Two thousand shares of restricted stock were granted during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 is based on options, RSUs and restricted stock ultimately expected to vest, and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures for stock options are based upon historical experience and approximate 3.7% annually. We estimated a 0% forfeiture rate for our RSUs and restricted stock due to the limited number of recipients and historical experience for these awards. As of March 31, 2016, total compensation expense related to non-vested stock options, RSUs and restricted stock not yet recognized was approximately $13.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.53 years. The following table is a summary of our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016 and the changes that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2016: 10 The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the closing price of our stock on the last trading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on March 31, 2016. The aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of our stock. The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $36 thousand. 5. INVESTMENTS At March 31, 2016, we held the following securities and investments, recorded at either fair value or cost. At December 31, 2015, we held the following securities and investments, recorded at either fair value or cost. 11 As of March 31, 2016, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, and government bonds had the following contractual maturities: Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Our investment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total investment portfolio. At March 31, 2016, we held a $30.0 million restricted certificate of deposit, which is carried at cost. This investment serves as a collateral deposit against the principal amount outstanding under loans made to ADTRAN pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond). At March 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of the Bond using a level 2 valuation technique was approximately $29.1 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard and Poor s credit rating of AAA. For more information on the Bond, see Debt under Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 2 of Part I of this report. We review our investment portfolio for potential other-than-temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% or more for six or more consecutive months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, other-than-temporary impairment charges were not significant. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method. The following table presents gross realized gains and losses related to our investments. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, gross unrealized losses related to individual securities in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant. 12 We have categorized our cash equivalents held in money market funds and our investments held at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique for the cash equivalents and investments as follows: Level 1 - Values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market; Level 2 - Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; Level 3 - Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs include information supplied by investees. 13 The fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each security. Our municipal variable rate demand notes have a structure that implies a standard expected market price. The frequent interest rate resets make it reasonable to expect the price to stay at par. These securities are priced at the expected market price. 6. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. When appropriate, we enter into various derivative transactions to enhance our ability to manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. Our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, and accordingly, all changes in the fair value of the instruments are recognized as other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The maximum contractual period for our derivatives is currently less than twelve months. Our derivative instruments are not subject to master netting arrangements and are not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2016, we had forward contracts outstanding with notional amounts totaling 1.8 million ($2.0 million), which mature in the second quarter of 2016. 14 The fair values of our derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows: The change in the fair values of our derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 7. INVENTORY At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, inventory consisted of the following: We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, raw materials reserves totaled $18.5 million and $17.5 million, respectively, and finished goods inventory reserves totaled $9.0 million and $9.2 million, respectively. 8. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill, all of which relates to our acquisition of Bluesocket, Inc., was $3.5 million at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and was previously recorded in our Enterprise Networks reportable segment. As a result of our new reporting structure, which is discussed further in Note 11, we reallocated goodwill from our Enterprise Networks reportable segment to our two, new reportable segments Network Solutions and Services &amp; Support. As a result, goodwill of $3.1 million and $0.4 million was reallocated to our Network Solutions and Services &amp; Support reportable segments, respectively. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test will be performed. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment in 2015, we concluded that it was not necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. There have been no impairment losses recognized since the acquisition in 2011. Intangible assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and include intangibles acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions of Objectworld Communications Corporation on September 15, 2009, Bluesocket, Inc. on August 4, 2011, and the NSN BBA business on May 4, 2012. 15 The following table presents our intangible assets as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015: Amortization expense, all of which relates to business acquisitions, was $0.4 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of March 31, 2016, the estimated future amortization expense of our intangible assets is as follows: 9. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY A summary of the changes in stockholders equity for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is as follows: Stock Repurchase Program Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock, which will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we repurchased 0.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $18.38 per share. As of March 31, 2016, we have the authority to purchase an additional 5.2 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors. 16 Stock Option Exercises We issued 15 thousand shares of treasury stock during the three months ended March 31, 2016 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $18.97. We received proceeds totaling $0.2 million from the exercise of these stock options during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Dividend Payments During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we paid cash dividends as follows (in thousands except per share amounts): Other Comprehensive Income Other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, reclassification adjustments for amounts included in net income related to impairments of available-for-sale securities, realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, and amortization of actuarial gains (losses) related to our defined benefit plan, defined benefit plan adjustments, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The following tables present changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, by component for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015: 17 The following tables present the details of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015: (1) Included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (1) Included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 18 The following table presents the tax effects related to the change in each component of other comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015: 10. EARNINGS PER SHARE A summary of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: Anti-dilutive options to purchase common stock outstanding were excluded from the above calculations. Anti-dilutive options totaled 5.9 million and 5.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 19 11. SEGMENT INFORMATION In 2015, we began a realignment of our organizational structure to better match our market opportunities, technological development initiatives, and improve efficiencies. During the first quarter of 2016, our chief operating decision maker requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2016, we began reporting our financial performance based on two, new reportable segments Network Solutions and Services &amp; Support. Network Solutions includes hardware products and next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior-generation products. Services &amp; Support includes our suite of ProCloud managed services, network installation, engineering and maintenance services, and fee-based technical support and equipment repair/replacement plans. We evaluate the performance of our new segments based on gross profit; therefore, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, interest and dividend income, interest expense, net realized investment gain/loss, other income/expense and provision for taxes are reported on a company-wide, functional basis only. Historical financial information by reportable segment and category, as discussed below, has been recast to conform to our new reporting structure. There are no inter-segment revenues. The following table presents information about the reported sales and gross profit of our reportable segments for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. We do not produce asset information by reportable segment; therefore, it is not reported. Sales by Category In addition to our new reporting segments, we will also report revenue for the following three categories Access &amp; Aggregation, Customer Devices, and Traditional &amp; Other Products. Access &amp; Aggregation generally includes software and hardware based products and services that communication service providers (CSPs) use to aggregate and/or originate network access technologies. The portfolio of ADTRAN solutions within this category includes a wide array of modular or fixed physical form factors designed to deliver the best technology and economic fit for our customers based on the target subscriber density and environmental conditions. The Access &amp; Aggregation category includes product and service families such as: Total Access 5000 Series Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) and Fiber to the Node (FTTN) Multi-Service Access Nodes (MSAN) hiX 5600 Series fiber aggregation and Fiber to the Node (FTTN) Multi-Service Access Nodes (MSAN) Fiber to the Distribution Point (FTTdp) Optical Network Units (ONU) Optical Line Terminals (OLT) Optical Networking Edge (ONE) aggregation Distribution Point Units (DPUs) IP Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) Cabinet and Outside-Plant (OSP) enclosures and services Network Management and Cloud based software platforms and applications Pluggable optical transceivers (i.e., SFP, SFP+, XFP, QSFP), cables and other miscellaneous materials Other products and services that are generally applicable to Access &amp; Aggregation 20 Customer Devices generally includes the products and services that provide end users access to the CSP network. The Customer Devices portfolio includes a comprehensive array of service provider and enterprise hardware and software products and services. The Customer Devices category includes products and services such as: Broadband customer premise solutions, including Passive Optical Network (PON) and point-to-point Ethernet Optical Network Terminals (ONTs) Residential and business gateways Wi-Fi access points and associated powering and switching infrastructure enterprise Session Border Controllers (eSBC) Branch office and access routers Carrier Ethernet services termination devices VoIP media gateways ProServices Planning, engineering, program management, maintenance, installation and commissioning services to implement the customer devices solutions into consumer, small business and enterprise locations Other products and services that are generally applicable to customer devices Traditional &amp; Other Products generally includes a mix of prior generation technologies products and services, as well as other products and services that do not fit within the Access &amp; Aggregation or Customer Devices categories. The Traditional &amp; Other Products category includes products and services such as: Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) based aggregation systems and customer devices HDSL, ADSL and other mature technologies used to deliver business and residential services over the CSP access and customer networks Other products and services that do not fit within the Access &amp; Aggregation and Customer Devices categories The table below presents sales information by category for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015: 12. LIABILITY FOR WARRANTY RETURNS Our products generally include warranties of 90 days to ten years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $9.0 million and $8.7 million at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 21 A summary of warranty expense and write-off activity for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent claims, disputes over contract agreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek damages or other relief, such as royalty payments related to patents, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. Although the outcome of any claim or litigation can never be certain, it is our opinion that the outcome of all contingencies of which we are currently aware will not materially affect our business, operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of March 31, 2016, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. 14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On April 12, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 28, 2016. The payment date will be May 12, 2016. The quarterly dividend payment will be approximately $4.4 million. In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. During the second quarter and as of May 4, 2016, we have repurchased 30 thousand shares of our common stock through open market purchases at an average cost of $18.64 per share. We currently have the authority to purchase an additional 5.2 million shares of our common stock under the current plan approved by the Board of Directors. 22 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. OVERVIEW ADTRAN, Inc. is a leading global provider of networking and communications equipment. Our solutions enable voice, data, video and Internet communications across a variety of network infrastructures. These solutions are deployed by many of the United States and the world s largest service providers, distributed enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses, public and private enterprises, and millions of individual users worldwide. Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors. An important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then lower the product s selling price based on the cost savings achieved in order to gain market share and/or improve gross margins. As a part of this strategy, we seek in most instances to be a high-quality, low-cost provider of products in our markets. Our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign, allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation. This strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers, while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers. We report revenue for the following three categories Access &amp; Aggregation, Customer Devices, and Traditional &amp; Other Products. Access &amp; Aggregation generally includes software and hardware based products and services that communication service providers (CSPs) use to aggregate and/or originate network access technologies. The portfolio of ADTRAN solutions within this category includes a wide array of modular or fixed physical form factors designed to deliver the best technology and economic fit for our customers based on the target subscriber density and environmental conditions. The Access &amp; Aggregation category includes product and service families such as: Total Access 5000 Series Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) and Fiber to the Node (FTTN) Multi-Service Access Nodes (MSAN) hiX 5600 Series fiber aggregation and Fiber to the Node (FTTN) Multi-Service Access Nodes (MSAN) Fiber to the Distribution Point (FTTdp) Optical Network Units (ONU) Optical Line Terminals (OLT) Optical Networking Edge (ONE) aggregation Distribution Point Units (DPUs) IP Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) Cabinet and Outside-Plant (OSP) enclosures and services Network Management and Cloud based software platforms and applications Pluggable optical transceivers (i.e., SFP, SFP+, XFP, QSFP), cables and other miscellaneous materials Other products and services that are generally applicable to Access &amp; Aggregation 23 Customer Devices generally includes the products and services that provide end users access to the CSP network. The Customer Devices portfolio includes a comprehensive array of service provider and enterprise hardware and software products and services. The Customer Devices category includes products and services such as: Broadband customer premise solutions, including Passive Optical Network (PON) and point-to-point Ethernet Optical Network Terminals (ONTs) Residential and business gateways Wi-Fi access points and associated powering and switching infrastructure enterprise Session Border Controllers (eSBC) Branch office and access routers Carrier Ethernet services termination devices VoIP media gateways ProServices Planning, engineering, program management, maintenance, installation and commissioning services to implement the customer devices solutions into consumer, small business and enterprise locations Other products and services that are generally applicable to customer devices Traditional &amp; Other Products generally includes a mix of prior generation technologies products and services, as well as other products and services that do not fit within the Access &amp; Aggregation or Customer Devices categories. The Traditional &amp; Other Products category includes products and services such as: Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) based aggregation systems and customer devices HDSL, ADSL and other mature technologies used to deliver business and residential services over the CSP access and customer networks Other products and services that do not fit within the Access &amp; Aggregation and Customer Devices categories See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information regarding these product categories. Sales were $142.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to $142.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Our gross margin increased to 46.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from 45.9% for the months ended March 31, 2015. Our operating income margin increased to 3.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from 1.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Net income was $5.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Our effective tax rate decreased to 37.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from 39.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.10 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to $0.06 for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past, and may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors, including customer order activity and backlog. Backlog levels vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other factors that affect customer order lead times. Many of our customers require prompt delivery of products. This requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand. If near-term demand for our products declines, or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated, our financial results could be adversely affected. Operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter. 24 Our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate movements, increased competition, customer order patterns, changes in product and services mix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs and announcements of new products by us or our competitors. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Also, not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements, which may negatively impact our operating results in a given quarter. Accordingly, our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and, in general, management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period. A list of factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results is included under Factors That Could Affect Our Future Results in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 2 of Part I of this report. These factors have also been discussed in more detail in Item 1A of Part I in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on February 24, 2016 with the SEC. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed significantly from those detailed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on February 24, 2016 with the SEC. EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2015 SALES Our sales decreased 0.4% from $142.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $142.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to a $2.3 million decrease in sales of our Traditional &amp; Other products, partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in sales of our Access &amp; Aggregation products and a $0.6 million increase in sales of our Customer Devices products. Network Solutions sales decreased 4.3% from $129.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $123.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of Access and Aggregation products and Traditional &amp; Other products, partially offset by an increase in Customer Devices products. The decrease in sales of our Access and Aggregation products is primarily attributable to a decrease in hiX product sales, partially offset by an increase in Total Access 5000 product sales. The decrease in sales of Traditional and Other products has been expected as customers continue to upgrade their networks to deliver higher bandwidth services by migrating to newer technologies, including products from our Access and Aggregation and Customer Devices product lines. While we expect that revenues from Traditional and Other products will continue to decline over time, these revenues may fluctuate and continue for years because of the time required for our customers to transition to newer technologies. The increase in sales of our Customer Devices products is primarily attributable to increased sales of our FTTP ONT products. Services &amp; Support sales increased 37.4% from $13.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $18.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to an increase in network installation services for access and aggregation products. 25 International sales, which are included in the Network Solutions and Services &amp; Support amounts discussed above, decreased 56.4% from $59.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $25.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. International sales, as a percentage of total sales, decreased from 41.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2015 to 18.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in international sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to the return to more seasonally normal buying patterns in Europe and also, relating to the decrease in international sales as a percentage of revenue, growing momentum in the U.S. broadband market. COST OF SALES As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased from 54.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to 53.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to regional revenue and product and services mix shifts. Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment s sales, decreased from 55.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to 51.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to regional revenue shift and customer and product mix. Services &amp; Support cost of sales, as a percent of that segment s sales, increased from 42.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to 67.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to a shift to more network installation services in the three months ended March 31, 2016, which have higher costs, versus a greater mix of maintenance and support services in the prior year. An important part of our strategy is to reduce the product cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product s price based on the cost savings achieved. This may cause variations in our gross profit percentage due to timing differences between the recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.9% from $31.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $30.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to a decrease in travel expense. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 21.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to 21.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Research and development expenses decreased 9.4% from $32.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $29.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in contract services. The decrease is compensation expense was primary attributable to the consolidation of engineering resources that occurred in the second quarter of 2015. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased from 22.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to 20.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2016. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities or a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared. We expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products and our expansion into international markets. We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development efforts which provides for new product development, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group. 26 INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME Interest and dividend income decreased 8.4%, or $0.1 million from the three months ended March 31, 2015 to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in interest and dividend income for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to a reduction in investment principal, partially offset by a slight increase in interest rates. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2016, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information on our revenue bond. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN Net realized investment gains decreased 44.5% from $3.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $1.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in realized investment gains for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to decreased gains from the sale of equity securities. See Investing Activities in Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET Other income (expense), net, comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, investment account management fees, and scrap raw material sales, changed from $0.4 million of expense in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $0.1 million of income in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The change for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to reduced losses on foreign currency transactions during the first quarter of 2016. INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rate decreased from 39.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to 37.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the research and development tax credit being made permanent. NET INCOME As a result of the above factors, net income increased $1.7 million from $3.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $5.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. As a percentage of sales, net income increased from 2.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2015 to 3.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2016. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, the cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. At March 31, 2016, cash on hand was $91.6 million and short-term investments were $29.3 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $120.9 million. At December 31, 2015, our cash on hand of $84.6 million and short-term investments of $34.4 million resulted in available short-term liquidity of $118.9 million. The increase in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2015 to March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to shifts among available investment option tenures to provide additional funds for our short-term cash needs. 27 Operating Activities Our working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, decreased 2.5% from $238.1 million as of December 31, 2015 to $232.1 million as of March 31, 2016. The decrease in our working capital is primarily attributable to a decrease in other receivables, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable. The quick ratio, defined as cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and net accounts receivable, divided by current liabilities, increased from 2.06 as of December 31, 2015 to 2.13 as of March 31, 2016. The increase in the quick ratio is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts payable. The current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, increased from 3.57 as of December 31, 2015 to 3.62 as of March 31, 2016. The increase in the current ratio is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by a decrease in other receivables. Net accounts receivable decreased 6.2% from $71.9 million at December 31, 2015 to $67.5 million at March 31, 2016. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $19 thousand at December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016. Quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased from 48 days as of December 31, 2015 to 43 days as of March 31, 2016. The change in net accounts receivable is due to changes in customer mix and the timing of sales and collections during the quarter. Certain international customers can have longer payment terms than U.S. customers. Other receivables decreased from $19.3 million at December 31, 2015 to $9.2 million at March 31, 2016. The decrease in other receivables is primarily attributable to the timing of filing returns and collections of VAT receivables in our international subsidiaries. Other receivables will also fluctuate due to the timing of shipments and collections for materials supplied to our contract manufacturers during the quarter. Quarterly inventory turnover decreased from 3.3 turns as of December 31, 2015 to 3.2 turns at March 31, 2016. Inventory increased 0.6% from December 31, 2015 to March 31, 2016. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to services activity and seasonal cycles of our business, ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory obsolescence that may occur due to rapidly changing technology and customer demand. Accounts payable decreased 12.4% from $48.7 million at December 31, 2015 to $42.6 million at March 31, 2016. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of supplies, inventory and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases. Investing Activities Capital expenditures totaled approximately $3.2 million and $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware, software, manufacturing and test equipment, and building improvements. Our combined short-term and long-term investments decreased $7.4 million from $232.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $225.0 million at March 31, 2016. This decrease reflects the impact of our cash needs for capital expenditures, purchases of treasury stock, and shareholder dividends, as well as net realized and unrealized losses and amortization of net premiums on our combined investments, partially offset by additional funds available for investment provided by our operating activities and stock option exercises by our employees. We invest all available cash not required for immediate use in operations primarily in securities that we believe bear minimal risk of loss. At March 31, 2016 these investments included corporate bonds of $60.9 million, municipal fixed-rate bonds of $15.7 million, asset-backed bonds of $20.6 million, mortgage/agency-backed bonds of $14.9 million, government bonds of $33.4 million, and variable rate demand notes of $2.2 million. At December 31, 2015, these investments included corporate bonds of $57.6 million, municipal fixed-rate bonds of $26.4 million, asset-backed bonds of $19.2 million, mortgage/agency-backed bonds of $15.4 million, and government bonds of $35.4 million. As of March 31, 2016, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, government bonds, and variable rate demand notes were classified as available-for-sale and had a combined duration of 1.07 years with an average credit rating of A+. Because our bond portfolio has a high quality rating and contractual maturities of a short duration, we are able to obtain prices for these bonds derived from observable market inputs, or for similar securities traded in an active market, on a daily basis. 28 Our long-term investments decreased 1.2% from $198.0 million at December 31, 2015 to $195.7 million at March 31, 2016. Long-term investments at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $30.0 million, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond. See Debt below for additional information. We have various equity investments included in long-term investments at a cost of $31.8 million and $31.6 million, and with a fair value of $33.0 million and $34.3 million, at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Long-term investments at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 also included $13.0 million and $12.8 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans, and $1.3 million of other investments carried at cost, consisting of interests in two private equity funds and an investment in a privately held telecommunications equipment manufacturer. We review our investment portfolio for potential other-than-temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% or more for six or more consecutive months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, other-than-temporary impairment charges were not significant. Financing Activities Dividends In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we paid dividends totaling $4.5 million. Debt We have amounts outstanding under loans made pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond) which totaled $28.9 million at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. At March 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of the Bond was approximately $29.1 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard &amp; Poor s credit rating of AAA. Included in long-term investments are restricted funds in the amount of $30.0 million at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, which is a collateral deposit against the principal amount of the Bond. We have the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. The Bond matures on January 1, 2020, and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under this program. We are required to make payments in the amounts necessary to pay the interest on the amounts currently outstanding. It is our intent to make annual principal payments in addition to the interest amounts that are due. In connection with this decision, $1.0 million of the Bond has been classified as a current liability in accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2016. Stock Repurchase Program Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock, which will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we repurchased 0.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $18.38 per share. As of March 31, 2016, we have the authority to purchase an additional 5.2 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors. 29 Stock Option Exercises We issued 15 thousand shares of treasury stock during the three months ended March 31, 2016 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $18.97. We received proceeds totaling $0.2 million from the exercise of these stock options during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, there have been no material changes in contractual obligations and commercial commitments from those discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed on February 24, 2016 with the SEC. We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of March 31, 2016, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS The following are some of the risks that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements: Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price. Our revenue for a particular period can be difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results. General economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. Our exposure to the credit risks of our customers and distributors may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow. We expect gross margins to vary over time, and our levels of product and services gross margins may not be sustainable. We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products in order to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology. Our products may not continue to comply with evolving regulations governing their sale, which may harm our business. Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws associated with our global activities could subject us to penalties or other adverse consequences. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable environmental regulations could adversely impact our results of operations. If our products do not interoperate with our customers networks, installations may be delayed or cancelled, which could harm our business. The lengthy sales and approval process required by major and other SPs for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue. We engage in research and development activities to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development efforts who may focus on more leading edge development. We depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenues and net income. Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and key components may prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and operating results. 30 We compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, installation and shipment volumes, field service repair obligations and other rework costs incurred in correcting product failures. If our estimates change, the liability for warranty obligations may be increased or decreased, impacting future cost of goods sold. Managing our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory. The continuing growth of our international operations could expose us to additional risks, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow. We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our success depends on our ability to reduce the selling prices of succeeding generations of our products. Breaches in our information systems could cause significant damage to our business and reputation. Our failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality, and commercial value of our products. Software under license from third parties for use in certain of our products may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. We may incur liabilities or become subject to litigation that would have a material effect on our business. Consolidation and deterioration in the competitive SP market could result in a significant decrease in our revenue. We depend on distributors who maintain inventories of our products. If the distributors reduce their inventories of these products, our sales could be adversely affected. If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with system integrators, SPs, and enterprise VARs, our sales may be negatively affected. If we fail to manage our exposure to worldwide financial and securities markets successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted. Changes in our effective tax rate or assessments arising from tax audits may have an adverse impact on our results. We are required to periodically evaluate the value of our long-lived assets, including the value of intangibles acquired and goodwill resulting from business acquisitions. Any future impairment charges required may adversely affect our operating results. We may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our restructuring plans. Our restructuring efforts may adversely affect our business and our operating results. Our success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel. Regulatory and potential physical impacts of climate change and other natural events may affect our customers and our production operations, resulting in adverse effects on our operating results. While we believe our internal control over financial reporting is adequate, a failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as our business expands could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price. The price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The foregoing list of risks is not exclusive. For a more detailed description of the risk factors associated with our business, see Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on February 24, 2016 with the SEC. 31ITEM 1.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (In thousands, except per share amounts) 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of ADTRAN , Inc. and its subsidiaries (ADTRAN) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting on Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements are not included herein. The December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet is derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature. The results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on February 24, 2016 with the SEC. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Our more significant estimates include the obsolete and excess inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred revenue components of multiple element sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred revenues, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments, and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition , including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASUs in 2016 containing implementation guidance related to ASU 2014-09, including: ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations; ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , which is intended to clarify two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance; and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which contains certain provisions and practical expedients in response to identified implementation issues. ASU 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. We plan to adopt ASU 2014-09 and the related ASUs on January 1, 2018, and we are currently evaluating the transition method that will be elected and the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 7 In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.2015-11, Inv entory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (ASU 2015-11). Currently, Topic 330, Inventory , requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable v alue less an approximately normal profit margin. ASU 2015-11 does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. ASU 2015-11 requires an entity to measure in scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less rea sonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The amendments should be applied prospec tively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2015-05 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17). ASU 2015-17 amends the existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance may be applied either prospectively, for all deferred tax assets and liabilities, or retrospectively to all periods presented. We have not selected a transition method or determined whether to early adopt ASU 2015-17 in 2016. Other than the revised balance sheet presentation of current deferred tax assets and liabilities, we do not believe the adoption of ASU 2015-17 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity's leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective approach is required. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including income tax effects, the classification of tax-related cash flows on the statement of cash flows, and accounting for forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted the following accounting standards, which had no material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows: In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-05, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (ASU 2015-05), which provides guidance on accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or retrospectively. We adopted ASU 2015-05 during the first quarter of 2016 and will apply the new standard prospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-05 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 2. INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rate decreased from 39.1% in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to 37.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the research and development tax credit being made permanent. 8 3. PENSION BENEFIT PLAN We maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. The following table summarizes the components of net periodic pension cost for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015: 4. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, which was recognized as follows: The fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. There were no options granted during the three months ended June 30, 2015. The weighted-average assumptions and value of options granted for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and the six months ended June 30, 2015 are as follows: The fair value of our RSUs is calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. No RSUs were granted or vested during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Twelve thousand RSUs were forfeited during the six months ended June 30, 2015. The fair value of restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. Two thousand shares of restricted stock were granted during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Two thousand shares of restricted stock vested during the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. 9 Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is based on options, RSUs and restricted stock ultimately expected to vest, and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures for stock options are based upon historical experience and approximate 3 . 7 % annually. We est imated a 0% forfeiture rate for our RSUs and restricted stock due to the limited number of recipients and historical experience for these awards. As of June 30, 2016, total compensation expense related to non-vested stock options, RSUs and restricted stock not yet recognized was approximately $11.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.4 years. The following table is a summary of our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 and the changes that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016: The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the closing price of our stock on the last trading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on June 30, 2016. The aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of our stock. The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.1 million. 10 5. INVESTMENTS At June 30, 2016, we held the following securities and investments, recorded at either fair value or cost. At December 31, 2015, we held the following securities and investments, recorded at either fair value or cost. As of June 30, 2016, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, and U.S. government bonds had the following contractual maturities: Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Our investment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total investment portfolio. 11 At June 30, 2016, we held a $30.0 million restricted certificate of deposit, which is carried at cost. This investment serves as a collateral deposit against the principal amount outstanding under loans made to ADTRAN pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond) , which totaled $28.9 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 . At June 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of the Bond using a level 2 valuation technique was approx imately $29 . 4 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard and Poor's credit rating of AAA. We have the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. The Bond matures on January 1, 2020, and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll with holdings we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under this program. We are required to make payments in the amounts necessary to pay the interest on the amounts currently outstanding. It is our intent to make annu al principal payments in addition to the interest amounts that are due. We review our investment portfolio for potential "other-than-temporary" declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% or more for six or more consecutive months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, other-than-temporary impairment charges were not significant. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method. The following table presents gross realized gains and losses related to our investments. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, gross unrealized losses related to individual securities in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant. 12 We have categorized our cash equivalents held in money market funds and our investments held at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique for the cash equivalents and investments as follows:Level 1 - Values based on unadjusted quot ed prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market; Level 2 - Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; Level 3 - Values based on prices or valuation techn iques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs include information supplied by investees. 13 The fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety of indus try standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each secur ity. Our variable rate demand notes have a structure that implies a standard expected market price. The frequent interest rate resets make it reasonable to expect the price to stay at par. These securities are priced at the expected market price. 6. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as these are remeasured to the functional currency through profit and loss. When appropriate, we enter into various derivative transactions to enhance our ability to manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. Our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, and accordingly, all changes in the fair value of the instruments are recognized as other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The maximum contractual period for our derivatives is currently less than twelve months. Our derivative instruments are not subject to master netting arrangements and are not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2016, we had forward contracts outstanding with notional amounts totaling 6.0 million ($6.7 million), which mature in the third quarter of 2016. The fair values of our derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows: The change in the fair values of our derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 7. INVENTORY At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, inventory consisted of the following: We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, raw materials reserves totaled $18.0 million and $17.5 million, respectively, and finished goods inventory reserves totaled $9.8 million and $9.2 million, respectively. 14 8. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill, all of which relates to our acquisition of Bluesocket, Inc., was $3.5 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and was previously recorded in our Enterprise Networks reportable segment. As a result of our new reporting structure, which is discussed further in Note 11, we reallocated goodwill from our Enterprise Networks reportable segment to our two, new reportable segments Network Solutions and Services &amp; Support. As a result, goodwill of $3.1 million and $0.4 million was reallocated to our Network Solutions and Services &amp; Support reportable segments, respectively. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test will be performed. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment in 2015, we concluded that it was not necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. There have been no impairment losses recognized since the acquisition in 2011. Intangible assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and include intangibles acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions of Objectworld Communications Corporation on September 15, 2009, Bluesocket, Inc. on August 4, 2011, and the NSN BBA business on May 4, 2012. The following table presents our intangible assets as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: Amortization expense, all of which relates to business acquisitions, was $0.4 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0.9 million and $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the estimated future amortization expense of our intangible assets is as follows: 15 9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY A summary of the changes in stockholders' equity for the six months ended June 30, 2016 is as follows: Stock Repurchase Program Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock, which will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $18.48 per share. As of June 30, 2016, we have the authority to purchase an additional 4.9 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors. Stock Option Exercises We issued 33 thousand shares of treasury stock during the six months ended June 30, 2016 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $18.97. We received proceeds totaling $0.5 million from the exercise of these stock options during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Dividend Payments During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we paid cash dividends as follows (in thousands except per share amounts): 16 Other Comprehensive Income Other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, reclassification adjustments for amounts included in net income related to impairments of available-for-sale securities, realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, and amortization of actuarial gains (losses) related to our defined benefit plan, defined benefit plan adjustments, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The following tables present changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, by component for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015: 17 The following tables present changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, by component for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015: 18 The following tables present the details of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015: (1) Included in the computation of net periodic pension cost.

EARNINGS PER SHARE A summary of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: Anti-dilutive options to purchase common stock outstanding were excluded from the above calculations. Anti-dilutive options totaled 5.6 million and 6.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 5.8 million and 5.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 11. SEGMENT INFORMATION In 2015, we began a realignment of our organizational structure to better match our market opportunities, technological development initiatives, and improve efficiencies. During the first quarter of 2016, our chief operating decision maker requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2016, we began reporting our financial performance based on two, new reportable segments Network Solutions and Services &amp; Support. Network Solutions includes hardware products and next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior-generation products. Services &amp; Support includes our suite of ProCloud managed services, network installation, engineering and maintenance services, and fee-based technical support and equipment repair/replacement plans. We evaluate the performance of our new segments based on gross profit; therefore, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, interest and dividend income, interest expense, net realized investment gain/loss, other income/expense and provision for taxes are reported on a company-wide, functional basis only. Historical financial information by reportable segment and category, as discussed below, has been recast to conform to our new reporting structure. There are no inter-segment revenues. The following table presents information about the reported sales and gross profit of our reportable segments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. We do not produce asset information by reportable segment; therefore, it is not reported. 22 Sales by Category In addition to our new reporting segments, we will also report revenue for the following three categories Access & Aggregation, Customer Devices, and Traditional & Other Products. Access &amp; Aggregation generally includes software and hardware based products and services that communication service providers (CSPs) use to aggregate and/or originate network access technologies. The portfolio of ADTRAN solutions within this category includes a wide array of modular or fixed physical form factors designed to deliver the best technology and economic fit for our customers based on the target subscriber density and environmental conditions. The Access &amp; Aggregation category includes product and service families such as: Total Access 5000 Series Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) and Fiber to the Node (FTTN) Multi-Service Access Nodes (MSAN) hiX 5600 Series fiber aggregation and Fiber to the Node (FTTN) Multi-Service Access Nodes (MSAN) Fiber to the Distribution Point (FTTdp) Optical Network Units (ONU) Optical Line Terminals (OLT) Optical Networking Edge (ONE) aggregation Distribution Point Units (DPUs) IP Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) Cabinet and Outside-Plant (OSP) enclosures and services Network Management and Cloud based software platforms and applications Pluggable optical transceivers (i.e., SFP, SFP+, XFP, QSFP), cables and other miscellaneous materials Other products and services that are generally applicable to Access & Aggregation Customer Devices generally includes the products and services that provide end users access to the CSP network.The Customer Devices portfolio includes a comprehensive array of service provider and enterprise hardware and software products and services. The Customer Devices category includes products and services such as: Broadband customer premise solutions, including Passive Optical Network (PON) and point-to-point Ethernet Optical Network Terminals (ONTs) Residential and business gateways Wi-Fi access points and associated powering and switching infrastructure enterprise Session Border Controllers (eSBC) Branch office and access routers Carrier Ethernet services termination devices VoIP media gateways ProServices Planning, engineering, program management, maintenance, installation and commissioning services to implement the customer devices solutions into consumer, small business and enterprise locations Other products and services that are generally applicable to customer devices 23 Traditional & Other Products generally includes a mix of prior generation technologies' products and services, as well as other products and services that do not fit within the Access & Aggregation or Customer D evices categories. The Traditional &amp; Other Products category includes products and services such as: Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) based aggregation systems and customer devices HDSL, ADSL and other mature technologies used to deliver business and residential services over the CSP access and customer networks Other products and services that do not fit within the Access & Aggregation and Customer Devices categories The table below presents sales information by category for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015: 12. LIABILITY FOR WARRANTY RETURNS Our products generally include warranties of 90 days to ten years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $8.9 million and $8.7 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. A summary of warranty expense and write-off activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent claims, disputes over contract agreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek damages or other relief, such as royalty payments related to patents, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. Although the outcome of any claim or litigation can never be certain, it is our opinion that the outcome of all contingencies of which we are currently aware will not materially affect our business, operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of June 30, 2016, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. 24 14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On July 12, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 28, 2016. The payment date will be August 11, 2016. The quarterly dividend payment will be approximately $4.3 million. In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. During the third quarter and as of August 5, 2016, we have repurchased 0.3 million shares of our common stock through open market purchases at an average cost of $17.99 per share. We currently have the authority to purchase an additional 4.6 million shares of our common stock under the current plan approved by the Board of Directors. 25 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. OVERVIEW ADTRAN, Inc. is a leading global provider of networking and communications equipment. Our solutions enable voice, data, video and Internet communications across a variety of network infrastructures. These solutions are deployed by many of the United States' and the world's largest service providers, distributed enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses, public and private enterprises, and millions of individual users worldwide. Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors. An important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then lower the product's selling price based on the cost savings achieved in order to gain market share and/or improve gross margins. As a part of this strategy, we seek in most instances to be a high-quality, low-cost provider of products in our markets. Our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign, allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation. This strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers, while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers. We report revenue for the following three categories Access & Aggregation, Customer Devices, and Traditional & Other Products. Access &amp; Aggregation generally includes software and hardware based products and services that communication service providers (CSPs) use to aggregate and/or originate network access technologies. The portfolio of ADTRAN solutions within this category includes a wide array of modular or fixed physical form factors designed to deliver the best technology and economic fit for our customers based on the target subscriber density and environmental conditions. The Access &amp; Aggregation category includes product and service families such as: Total Access 5000 Series Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) and Fiber to the Node (FTTN) Multi-Service Access Nodes (MSAN) hiX 5600 Series fiber aggregation and Fiber to the Node (FTTN) Multi-Service Access Nodes (MSAN) Fiber to the Distribution Point (FTTdp) Optical Network Units (ONU) Optical Line Terminals (OLT) Optical Networking Edge (ONE) aggregation Distribution Point Units (DPUs) IP Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) Cabinet and Outside-Plant (OSP) enclosures and services Network Management and Cloud based software platforms and applications Pluggable optical transceivers (i.e., SFP, SFP+, XFP, QSFP), cables and other miscellaneous materials Other products and services that are generally applicable to Access & Aggregation 26 Customer Devices generally includes the products and services that provide end users access to the CSP network.The Customer Devices portfolio includes a comprehensive array of service provider and enterprise hardware and software products and services. The Customer Devices category includes products and services such as: Broadband customer premise solutions, including Passive Optical Network (PON) and point-to-point Ethernet Optical Network Terminals (ONTs) Residential and business gateways Wi-Fi access points and associated powering and switching infrastructure enterprise Session Border Controllers (eSBC) Branch office and access routers Carrier Ethernet services termination devices VoIP media gateways ProServices Planning, engineering, program management, maintenance, installation and commissioning services to implement the customer devices solutions into consumer, small business and enterprise locations Other products and services that are generally applicable to customer devices Traditional &amp; Other Products generally includes a mix of prior generation technologies' products and services, as well as other products and services that do not fit within the Access & Aggregation or Customer Devices categories. The Traditional &amp; Other Products category includes products and services such as: Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) based aggregation systems and customer devices HDSL, ADSL and other mature technologies used to deliver business and residential services over the CSP access and customer networks Other products and services that do not fit within the Access & Aggregation and Customer Devices categories See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information regarding these product categories. Sales were $162.7 million and $304.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $160.1 million and $303.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Our gross margin increased to 48.5% and 47.5% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 from 42.6% and 44.2% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Our operating income margin increased to 9.1% and 6.7% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 from 0.4% and 0.9% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Net income was $10.2 million and $15.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $2.5 million and $5.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Our effective tax rate decreased to 37.8% and 37.9% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 from 38.1% and 39.1% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.21 and $0.31 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $0.05 and $0.11 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past, and may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors, including customer order activity and backlog. Backlog levels vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other factors that affect customer order lead times. Many of our customers require prompt delivery of products. This requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand. If near-term demand for our products declines, or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated, our financial results could be adversely affected. Operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter. 27 Our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market conditions, forei gn currency exchange rate movements, increased competition, customer order patterns, changes in product and services mix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs and announcements o f new products by us or our competitors. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this invento ry may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Also, not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements, which may negati vely impact our operating results in a given quarter. Accordingly, our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and, in general, management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period. A list of factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results is included under "Factors That Could Affect Our Future Results" in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained in Item 2 of Part I of this report. These factors have also been discussed in more detail in Item 1A of Part I in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on February 24, 2016 with the SEC. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed significantly from those detailed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on February 24, 2016 with the SEC. EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 SALES Our sales increased 1.6% from $160.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $162.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and increased 0.6% from $303.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $304.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in sales for the three months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to a $10.8 million increase in sales of our Customer Devices products, a $2.2 million increase in sales of our Traditional &amp; Other products, partially offset by a $10.5 million decrease in sales of our Access &amp; Aggregation products. The increase in sales for the six months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to a $11.5 million increase in sales of our Customer Devices products, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease in sales of our Access &amp; Aggregation products. Network Solutions sales decreased 3.9% from $144.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $138.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and decreased 4.1% from $273.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $262.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of Access and Aggregation products, partially offset by an increase in Customer Devices products. The decrease in sales of our Access and Aggregation products is primarily attributable to a decrease in international hiX product sales, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Total Access 5000 product sales. The increase in sales of our Customer Devices products is primarily attributable to increased sales of our FTTP ONT products and Ethernet products. Services &amp; Support sales increased 50.6% from $16.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $24.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and increased 44.6% from $29.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $42.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to an increase in network installation services for access and aggregation products. 28 International sales, which are included in the Network Solutions and Services & Support amounts discussed a bove, decreased 47.8% from $55.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $29.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and decreased 52.3% from $115.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $54.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Inter national sales, as a percentage of total sales, decreased from 34.8% and 38.0% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 to 17.9 % and 18 .0% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in international sales for the three and six m onths ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to the return to more seasonally normal buying patterns in Europe and also, relating to the decrease in international sales as a percentage of revenue, growing momentum in the U.S. broadband market. COST OF SALES As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased from 57.4% in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to 51.5% in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and decreased from 55.8% in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to 52.5% in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in cost of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift and a change in product and services mix. Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment's sales, decreased from 58.4% in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to 49.0% in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and decreased from 56.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to 50.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in cost of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift and customer and product mix. Services &amp; Support cost of sales, as a percent of that segment's sales, increased from 47.9% in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to 65.8% in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and increased from 45.6% in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to 66.5% in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in cost of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to an increase in network installation services, which have higher costs, versus a greater mix of maintenance and support services in the prior periods. An important part of our strategy is to reduce the product cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product's price based on the cost savings achieved. This may cause variations in our gross profit percentage due to timing differences between the recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2.3% from $32.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $32.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and increased 0.7% from $63.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $63.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease in professional services. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 20.1% in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to 20.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and was consistent at 20.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Research and development expenses decreased 11.8% from $35.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $31.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and decreased 10.7% from $68.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $60.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation expense and testing expense. The decrease in research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation expense and testing expense, partially offset by an increase in contract services. The decrease is compensation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was primary attributable to the consolidation of engineering resources that occurred in the second quarter of 2015. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased from 22.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to 19.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and decreased from 22.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to 19.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities or a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared. 29 W e expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products and our expansion into international markets. We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product de velopment efforts which provides for new product development, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group. INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME Interest and dividend income increased 2.1%, or $19 thousand from the three months ended June 30, 2015 to the three months ended June 30, 2016, and decreased 3.2%, or $0.1 million from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest and dividend income for the three months ended June 30, 2016, is primarily attributable to an increase in interest rates. The decrease in interest and dividend income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to a reduction in investment principal, partially offset by a small increase in interest rates. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016, and $0.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information on our revenue bond. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN Net realized investment gains decreased 65.9% from $3.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $1.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and decreased 55.4% from $6.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $2.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in realized investment gains for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to decreased gains from the sale of equity securities. See "Investing Activities" in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET Other income (expense), net, comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, investment account management fees, and scrap raw material sales, changed from $0.5 million of expense in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $0.3 million of expense in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and changed from $0.9 million of expense in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $0.1 million of expense in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The change for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to reduced losses on foreign currency transactions. INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rate decreased from 39.1% in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to 37.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the research and development tax credit being made permanent. NET INCOME As a result of the above factors, net income increased $7.7 million from $2.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $10.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and increased $9.4 million from $5.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $15.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. As a percentage of sales, net income increased from 1.6% in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to 6.3% in the three months ended June 30, 2016, and increased from 1.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to 5.0% in the six months ended June 30, 2016. 30 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, the cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. At June 30, 2016, cash on hand was $70.9 million and short-term investments were $50.9 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $121.8 million, of which $34.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2015, cash on hand was $84.6 million and short-term investments were $34.4 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $118.9 million, of which $38.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The increase in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to shifts among available investment option tenures to provide funds for our short-term cash needs. Operating Activities Our working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, increased 1.3% from $238.1 million as of December 31, 2015 to $241.2 million as of June 30, 2016. The increase in our working capital is primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in other receivables and inventory, and an increase in accounts payable. The quick ratio, defined as cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and net accounts receivable, divided by current liabilities, remained consistent at 2.06 as of December 31, 2015 and 2.05 as of June 30, 2016. The current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, decreased from 3.57 as of December 31, 2015 to 3.34 as of June 30, 2016. The decrease in the current ratio is primarily attributable to an increase in accounts payable, accrued wages and benefits, and a decrease in inventory, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. Net accounts receivable increased 24.3% from $71.9 million at December 31, 2015 to $89.4 million at June 30, 2016. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $19 thousand at December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016. Quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) increased from 48 days as of December 31, 2015 to 50 days as of June 30, 2016. The change in net accounts receivable is due to changes in customer mix and the timing of sales and collections during the quarter. Certain international customers can have longer payment terms than U.S. customers. Other receivables decreased from $19.3 million at December 31, 2015 to $11.7 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease in other receivables is primarily attributable to the timing of filing returns and collections of VAT receivables in our international subsidiaries. Other receivables will also fluctuate due to the timing of shipments and collections for materials supplied to our contract manufacturers during the quarter. Quarterly inventory turnover increased from 3.3 turns as of December 31, 2015 to 3.7 turns at June 30, 2016. Inventory decreased 5.0% from December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to services activity and seasonal cycles of our business, ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory obsolescence that may occur due to rapidly changing technology and customer demand. Accounts payable increased 21.7% from $48.7 million at December 31, 2015 to $59.2 million at June 30, 2016. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of supplies, inventory and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases. Investing Activities Capital expenditures totaled approximately $6.7 million and $5.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware, software, manufacturing and test equipment, and building improvements. Our combined short-term and long-term investments increased $4.7 million from $232.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $237.1 million at June 30, 2016. This increase reflects the impact of our cash needs for capital expenditures, purchases of treasury stock, and shareholder dividends, as well as net realized and unrealized losses and amortization of net premiums on our combined investments, partially offset by additional funds available for investment provided by our operating activities and stock option exercises by our employees. 31 W e invest all available cash not required for immediate use in operations primarily in securities t hat we believe bear minimal risk of loss. At June 30, 2016 these investments included corporate bonds of $54. 1 million, municipal fixed-rate bonds of $16.9 million, asset-backed bonds of $23. 6 million, mortgage/agency-backed bonds of $19.2 million, U.S. go vernment bonds of $33. 8 million, and variable rate demand notes of $11.7 million. At December 31, 2015, these investments included corporate bonds of $57.6 million, municipal fixed-rate bonds of $26.4 million, asset-backed bonds of $19.2 million, mortgage/ agency-backed bonds of $15.4 million, and U.S. government bonds of $35.4 million. As of June 30, 2016, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds, and variable rate demand notes were classified as available-for-sale and had a combined duration of 0. 96 years with an average Standard & Poor's credit rating of AA- . Because our bond portfolio has a high quality rating and contractual maturities of a short duration, we are able to obta in prices for these bonds derived from observable market inputs, or for similar securities traded in an active market, on a daily basis. Our long-term investments decreased 5.9% from $198.0 million at December 31, 2015 to $186.2 million at June 30, 2016. Long-term investments at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $30.0 million, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond. See "Debt" below for additional information. We have various equity investments included in long-term investments at a cost of $32.9 million and $31.6 million, and with a fair value of $33.4 million and $34.3 million, at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Long-term investments at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 also included $13.1 million and $12.8 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans, and $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of other investments carried at cost, consisting of interests in two private equity funds and an investment in a privately held telecommunications equipment manufacturer. We review our investment portfolio for potential "other-than-temporary" declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% or more for six or more consecutive months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, other-than-temporary impairment charges were not significant. Financing Activities Dividends In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we paid dividends totaling $8.9 million. Debt We have amounts outstanding under loans made pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond) which totaled $28.9 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. At June 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of the Bond was approximately $29.4 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating of AAA. Included in long-term investments are restricted funds in the amount of $30.0 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, which is a collateral deposit against the principal amount of the Bond. We have the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. The Bond matures on January 1, 2020, and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under this program. We are required to make payments in the amounts necessary to pay the interest on the amounts currently outstanding. It is our intent to make annual principal payments in addition to the interest amounts that are due. In connection with this decision, $1.0 million of the Bond has been classified as a current liability in accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2016. Stock Repurchase Program Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock, which will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $18.48 per share. As of June 30, 2016, we have the authority to purchase an additional 4.9 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors. 32 Stock Option Exercises We issued 33 thousand shares of treasury stock during the six months ended June 30, 2016 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $18.97. We received proceeds totaling $0.5 million from the exercise of these stock options during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, there have been no material changes in contractual obligations and commercial commitments from those discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed on February 24, 2016 with the SEC. We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of June 30, 2016, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. 33ITEM 1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of ADTRAN , Inc. and its subsidiaries (ADTRAN) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting on Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements are not included herein. The December 31, 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet is derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature. The results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed on February 24, 2017 with the SEC. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Our more significant estimates include the obsolete and excess inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred revenue components of multiple element sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred revenues, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments, and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition , including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASUs in 2016 containing implementation guidance related to ASU 2014-09, including: ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations; ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , which is intended to clarify two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance; ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which contains certain provisions and practical expedients in response to identified implementation issues; and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is intended to clarify the Codification or to correct unintended application of guidance. ASU 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. We plan to adopt ASU 2014-09 and the related ASUs on January 1, 2018, and we are currently evaluating the transition method that will be elected. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact of these ASUs, and we believe the most significant potential impact relates to our accounting for software license and installation services revenues. We do not believe there will be a significant impact to product or maintenance revenues. 7 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity's leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective approach is required. We anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have a material impact on our financial position; however, we do not belie ve adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations. We believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for operating leases for office space and equipment. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, entities will be required to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual or interim impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating whether to early adopt ASU 2017-04, but we do not expect it will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07, Compensation Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (ASU 2017-07). ASU 2017-07 amends ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits , to require employers that present a measure of operating income in their statements of earnings to include only the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in operating expenses (together with other employee compensation costs). The other components of net benefit cost, including amortization of prior service cost/credit, and settlement and curtailment effects, are to be included in non-operating expenses. ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect ASU 2017-07 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. During the first quarter of 2017, we adopted the following accounting standards, which had no material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows: In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (ASU 2015-11). Currently, Topic 330, Inventory , requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. ASU 2015-11 does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. ASU 2015-11 requires an entity to measure in scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We adopted ASU 2015-05 in the first quarter of 2017, and there was no material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we began recognizing all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit as a discrete event. The treatment of forfeitures has changed as we have elected to discontinue our past practice of estimating forfeitures and now account for forfeitures as they occur. As a result, we recorded an increase in additional paid in capital of $0.1 million, a charge to beginning retained earnings of $0.1 million, and an increase in the deferred tax assets related to non-qualified stock options and RSUs of $10 thousand. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows within operating activities. We elected to retrospectively apply the changes in presentation to the statements of cash flows and no longer classify excess tax benefits as a financing activity, which had no effect on our cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2016. There was no material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of these changes. 8 2.BUSINESS COMBINATIONS On September 13, 2016, we acquired key fiber access products, technologies and service relationships from subsidiaries of CommScope, Inc. for $0.9 million in cash. This acquisition will enhance our solutions for the cable MSO industry and will provide cable operators with the scalable solutions, services and support they require to compete in the multi-gigabit service delivery market. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. We have included the financial results of this acquisition in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. These revenues are included in the Network Solutions reportable segment, and in the Access &amp; Aggregation and Customer Devices categories. We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $3.5 million during the third quarter of 2016, net of income taxes, subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties. The bargain purchase gain of $3.5 million represents the excess fair value of the net assets acquired over the consideration exchanged. We have assessed the recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on historical and pro forma data for future periods and have concluded that our valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate. The allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, subject to working capital adjustments, is as follows: The details of the acquired intangible assets are as follows: 9 The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 201 5. This unaudited supplemental pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 201 5 , nor is it indicative of any future results. Aside from revising the 2015 net income for the effect of the bargain purchase gain, t here were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.7 million related to this acquisition. 3. INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rate decreased from 37.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 20.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to an 11% effective rate reduction for a provision-to-return adjustment related to the assignment of research and development expenditures to specific company engineering locations, and the effective income tax rates among the respective jurisdictions. 4. PENSION BENEFIT PLAN We maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. The following table summarizes the components of net periodic pension cost for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: 5. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, performance stock units (PSUs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, which was recognized as follows: 10 Stock Options The following table is a summary of our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 and the changes that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2017: The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the closing price of our stock on the last trading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on March 31, 2017. The aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of our stock. The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $0.4 million. As of March 31, 2017, there was $6.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.0 years. The fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. There were no options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2017 or 2016. PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock The following table is a summary of our PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and the changes that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2017: The fair value of our PSUs with market conditions is calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. The fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. During the first quarter of 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a PSU grant of 0.5 million shares that contain performance conditions. The fair value of these performance-based PSU awards was equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. As of March 31, 2017, there was $8.8 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 3.2 years. In addition, there was $11.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested performance-based PSUs, which will be recognized over the requisite service period of three years as achievement of the performance objective becomes probable. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, no compensation expense was recognized related to these performance-based PSU awards. 11 6 . INVESTMENTS At March 31, 2017, we held the following securities and investments, recorded at either fair value or cost: At December 31, 2016, we held the following securities and investments, recorded at either fair value or cost: As of March 31, 2017, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds, foreign government bonds and variable rate demand notes had the following contractual maturities: Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Our investment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total investment portfolio. 12 At March31, 2017 , we held a $27 . 8 million restricted certificate of deposit, which is carried at cost. This investment serves as a collateral deposit ag ainst the principal amount outstanding under loans made to ADTRAN pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond) , which totaled $27 . 8 million at March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 . At March31, 2017 , the estimated f air value of the Bond using a level 2 valuation technique was approximately $2 7 . 9 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard and Poor's credit rating of AAA. We have the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. The Bond matures on January 1, 2020, and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incenti ves from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under this program. We are required to make payments in the amounts necessary to pay the interest on the amounts currently outstanding. It is our intent to make annual principal payments in addition to the interest amounts that are due. We review our investment portfolio for potential "other-than-temporary" declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% or more for six or more consecutive months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, other-than-temporary impairment charges were not significant. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method. The following table presents gross realized gains and losses related to our investments. As of March 31, 2017 and 2016, gross unrealized losses related to individual securities in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant. 13 We have categorized our cash equivalents held in money market funds and our investments held at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique for the cash equivalents and investments as follows:Level 1 - Values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market; Level 2 - Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; Level 3 - Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs include information supplied by investees. 14 The fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety of indust ry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each securi ty. Our variable rate demand notes have a structure that implies a standard expected market price. The frequent interest rate resets make it reasonable to expect the price to stay at par. These securities are priced at the expected market price. 7. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We participate in foreign exchange forward contracts in connection with the management of exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Cash Flow Hedges Our cash flow hedging activities utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the planned purchase of products from foreign suppliers. Purchases of U.S. denominated inventory by our European subsidiary represent our primary exposure. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are not recognized in current operating results, but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. This reclassification is recorded in the same line item of the consolidated statements of income as where the effects of the hedged item are recorded, which is cost of sales. Undesignated Hedges We have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as outstanding non-functional balances are revalued to the functional currency through profit and loss. When appropriate, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to help manage the volatility relating to these valuation exposures. All changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments that do not qualify for or are not designated for hedged accounting transactions are recognized as other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of March 31, 2017, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding with notional amounts totaling $15.0 million ( 14.1 million), which hedge a portion of projected inventory purchases expected to be settled in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. We have determined that there was no hedge ineffectiveness for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 related to these contracts. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. Our derivative instruments are not subject to master netting arrangements and are not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values of our derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows: The change in the fair values of our derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income during three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: 15 The change in our derivatives designated as hedging instruments recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and reclassified to income during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: 8. INVENTORY At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, inventory consisted of the following: We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, raw materials reserves totaled $14.5 million and $14.6 million, respectively, and finished goods inventory reserves totaled $11.6 million and $10.6 million, respectively. 9. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill, all of which relates to our acquisition of Bluesocket, Inc., was $3.5 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, of which $3.1 million and $0.4 million is allocated to our Network Solutions and Services &amp; Support reportable segments, respectively. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test will be performed. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment in 2016, we concluded that it was not necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. There have been no impairment losses recognized since the acquisition in 2011. Intangible assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and include intangibles acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions of Objectworld Communications Corporation on September 15, 2009, Bluesocket, Inc. on August 4, 2011, the NSN BBA business on May 4, 2012, and CommScope's active fiber access business on September 13, 2016. The following table presents our intangible assets as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016: 16 Amortization expense, all of which relates to business acquisitions, was $1 . 1 million and $0 . 4 millio n for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. As of March 31, 2017, the estimated future amortization expense of our intangible assets is as follows: 10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY A summary of the changes in stockholders' equity for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is as follows: Stock Repurchase Program Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock, which will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we repurchased 0.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $21.44 per share. As of March 31, 2017, we have the authority to purchase an additional 4.2 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors. Stock Option Exercises We issued 0.1 million shares of treasury stock during the three months ended March 31, 2017 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $23.02. We received proceeds totaling $1.4 million from the exercise of these stock options during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Dividend Payments During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we paid cash dividends as follows (in thousands except per share amounts): 17 O ther Comprehensive Income Other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, reclassification adjustments for amounts included in net income related to impairments of available-for-sale securities, realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, and amortization of actuarial gains (losses) related to our defined benefit plan, defined benefit plan adjustments, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The following tables present changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, by component for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: 18 The following tables present the details of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 (1) Included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (1) Included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 19 T he following table presents the tax effects related to the change in each component of other comprehensive income for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 : 11. EARNINGS PER SHARE A summary of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: Anti-dilutive options to purchase common stock outstanding were excluded from the above calculations. Anti-dilutive options totaled 4.0 million and 5.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 12. SEGMENT INFORMATION We operate in two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions and (2) Services &amp; Support. Network Solutions includes hardware products and next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior-generation products. Services &amp; Support includes our suite of ProCloud managed services, network installation, engineering and maintenance services, and fee-based technical support and equipment repair/replacement plans. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on gross profit; therefore, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, interest and dividend income, interest expense, net realized investment gain/loss, other income/expense and provision for taxes are reported on a company-wide, functional basis only. There are no inter-segment revenues. 20 The following table presents information about the reported sales and gross profit of our reportable segments for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 . We do not produce asset information by reportable segment; therefore, it is not reported. Sales by Category In addition to our reporting segments, we also report revenue for the following three categories Access & Aggregation, Customer Devices, and Traditional & Other Products. The table below presents sales information by category for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: 13. LIABILITY FOR WARRANTY RETURNS Our products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $9.0 million and $8.5 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a receivable and a reduction in warranty expense related to a settlement with a third party supplier for a defective component. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. A summary of warranty expense and write-off activity for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent claims, disputes over contract agreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek damages or other relief, such as royalty payments related to patents, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. Although the outcome of any claim or litigation can never be certain, it is our opinion that the outcome of all contingencies of which we are currently aware will not materially affect our business, operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of March 31, 2017, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. 21 15 . SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On April 18, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 4, 2017. The payment date will be May 18, 2017. The quarterly dividend payment will be approximately $4.3 million. In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. During the second quarter and as of May 3, 2017, we have repurchased 50 thousand shares of our common stock through open market purchases at an average cost of $19.91 per share. We currently have the authority to purchase an additional 4.1 million shares of our common stock under the current plan approved by the Board of Directors. 22 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. OVERVIEW ADTRAN, Inc. is a leading global provider of networking and communications equipment. Our solutions enable voice, data, video and Internet communications across a variety of network infrastructures. These solutions are deployed by many of the United States' and the world's largest communications service providers (CSPs), distributed enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses, public and private enterprises, and millions of individual users worldwide. Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors. An important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then lower the product's selling price based on the cost savings achieved in order to gain market share and/or improve gross margins. As a part of this strategy, we seek in most instances to be a high-quality, low-cost provider of products in our markets. Our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign, allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation. This strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers, while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers. We report revenue for the following three categories Access & Aggregation, Customer Devices, and Traditional & Other Products. Access &amp; Aggregation solutions are used by CSPs to connect their network infrastructure to their subscribers. This category includes software and hardware-based products and services that aggregate and/or originate access technologies. The portfolio of ADTRAN solutions within this category includes a wide array of modular or fixed physical form factors designed to deliver the best technology and economic fit based on the target subscriber density and environmental conditions. The Access &amp; Aggregation category includes product and service families such as: Total Access 5000 Series Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) and Fiber to the Node (FTTN) Multi-Service Access Nodes (MSAN) hiX 5600 Series fiber aggregation and FTTN MSAN Fiber to the Distribution Point (FTTdp) Optical Network Units (ONU) GPON, EPON and 10G PON Optical Line Terminals (OLT) SDX Fiber Access network elements Optical Networking Edge (ONE) aggregation IP Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) Cabinet and Outside-Plant (OSP) enclosures and services Network Management and Cloud-based software platforms and applications Pluggable optical transceivers (i.e., SFP, SFP+, XFP, QSFP), cables and other miscellaneous materials Planning, engineering, program management, maintenance, installation and commissioning services to implement customer network solutions Other products and services that are generally applicable to Access & Aggregation 23 Customer Devices includes our products and services that provide en d users access to CSP networks. Our Customer Devices portfolio includes a comprehensive array of service provider and enterprise hardware and software products and services. The Customer Devices category includes products and services such as: Broadband customer premise solutions, including Passive Optical Network (PON) and point-to-point Ethernet Optical Network Terminals (ONTs) Radio Frequency over Glass (RFoG) MicroNodes Residential and business gateways Wi-Fi access points and associated powering and switching infrastructure enterprise Session Border Controllers (eSBC) Branch office and access routers Carrier Ethernet services termination devices VoIP media gateways ProServices pre-sale and post-sale technical support Planning, engineering, program management, maintenance, installation and commissioning services to implement the customer devices solutions into consumer, small business and enterprise locations Other products and services that are generally applicable to customer devices Traditional &amp; Other Products generally includes a mix of prior generation technologies' products and services, as well as other products and services that do not fit within the Access & Aggregation or Customer Devices categories. The Traditional &amp; Other Products category includes products and services such as: Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) based aggregation systems and customer devices HDSL, ADSL and other mature technologies used to deliver business and residential services over the CSP access and customer networks Other products and services that do not fit within the Access & Aggregation and Customer Devices categories See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information regarding these product categories. Sales were $170.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $142.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Our gross margin decreased to 43.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 46.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Our operating income margin increased to 4.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 3.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Net income was $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $5.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Our effective tax rate decreased to 20.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 37.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.14 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $0.10 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past, and may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors, including customer order activity and backlog. Backlog levels vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other factors that affect customer order lead times. Many of our customers require prompt delivery of products. This requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand. If near-term demand for our products declines, or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated, our financial results could be adversely affected. Operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter. 24 Our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate movements, increased competition, customer order patterns, changes in product and services mix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs and announcements of new products by us or our competitors. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases t he risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Also, not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet cus tomer delivery requirements, which may negatively impact our operating results in a given quarter. Accordingly, our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and, in general, management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period. Factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results are included in Item 1A of Part I in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed on February 24, 2017 with the SEC. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed significantly from those detailed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed on February 24, 2017 with the SEC. EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016 SALES Our sales increased 19.7% from $142.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $170.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to a $26.3 million increase in sales of our Access &amp; Aggregation products, a $3.9 million increase in sales of our Customer Devices products, partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in sales of our Traditional &amp; Other products. Network Solutions sales increased 15.9% from $123.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $143.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of Access &amp; Aggregation products and Customer Devices products, partially offset by a decrease in sales of our Traditional &amp; Other products. The increase in sales of our Access &amp; Aggregation products for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to increased VDSL2 vectoring product sales in the European carrier market. The increase in sales of our Customer Devices products is primarily attributable to increased fiber product sales in the North American cable MSO market. While we expect that revenues from Traditional &amp; Other products will continue to decline over time, these revenues may fluctuate and continue for years because of the time required for our customers to transition to newer technologies. Services &amp; Support sales increased 45.6% from $18.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $26.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in network installation services for Access &amp; Aggregation products. International sales, which are included in the Network Solutions and Services &amp; Support amounts discussed above, increased 97.3% from $25.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $51.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. International sales, as a percentage of total sales, increased from 18.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 30.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Our international revenues are affected to a great extent by the timing of network upgrade projects at our larger European customers and by changes in foreign exchange rates in territories in which we sell our products and services. In first quarter 2017, international network upgrades resumed; whereas, in 2016 our largest European customer focused on completing network upgrade activities in regions outside of our footprint with them. 25 COST OF SALES As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 53.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 56.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, and services and support mix, partially offset by a reduction in warranty expense related to a settlement with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer. Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment's sales, increased from 51.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 53.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in the cost of sales percentage for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift and customer and product mix, partially offset by a reduction in warranty expense related to a settlement with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer. Services &amp; Support cost of sales, as a percent of that segment's sales, increased from 67.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 74.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in the cost of sales percentage for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in network installation services in the first quarter of 2017, which have higher costs, as opposed to a greater mix of maintenance and support services, which have lower costs, realized in the first quarter of 2016. An important part of our strategy is to reduce the product cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product's price based on the cost savings achieved. This may cause variations in our gross profit percentage due to timing differences between the recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 12.9% from $30.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $34.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to increases in ERP implementation expenses, travel expenses and performance-based compensation expense. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 21.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 20.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Research and development expenses increased 8.2% from $29.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $31.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in labor and engineering materials cost related to customer specific projects and amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased from 20.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 18.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities or a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared. We expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products and our expansion into international markets. We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development efforts which provides for new product development, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group. INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME Interest and dividend income increased 9.1%, or $0.1 million, in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in interest and dividend income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in the rate of return on fixed income investments. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information on our revenue bond. 26 NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN Net realized investment gains decreased 72.8% from $1.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $0.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in realized investment gains for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to decreased gains from the sale of equity securities. See "Investing Activities" in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET Other income (expense), net, comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, investment account management fees, and scrap raw material sales, remained constant at $0.1 million of income in the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rate decreased from 37.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 20.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to an 11% effective rate reduction for a provision-to-return adjustment related to the assignment of research and development expenditures to specific company engineering locations, and the effective income tax rates among the respective jurisdictions. NET INCOME As a result of the above factors, net income increased $1.6 million from $5.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $6.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. As a percentage of sales, net income increased from 3.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 3.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, the cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. At March 31, 2017, cash on hand was $72.6 million and short-term investments were $52.5 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $125.0 million, of which $51.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, cash on hand was $79.9 million and short-term investments were $43.2 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $123.1 million, of which $42.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S. and our current business plans do not indicate a need to repatriate to fund domestic operations. The increase in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to shifts among available investment option tenures to provide funds for our short-term cash needs. Operating Activities Our working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, increased 2.8% from $226.4 million as of December 31, 2016 to $232.8 million as of March 31, 2017, and our current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, increased from 2.79 as of December 31, 2016 to 2.91 as of March 31, 2017. The increase in our working capital and current ratio is primarily attributable to an increase in inventory and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued wages and benefits, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accrued expenses and income tax payable. The quick ratio, defined as cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and net accounts receivable, divided by current liabilities, increased from 1.70 as of December 31, 2016 to 1.73 as of March 31, 2017. The increase in the quick ratio is primarily attributable to a decrease in accrued wages and benefits and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and income tax payable. 27 Accounts receivable de creased 7.5% from $92.3 million at December31, 2016 to $85.4 million at March31, 2017. We had no a llowance for doubtful accounts at December31, 2016 or March31, 2017 . Quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) de creased from 52 days as of December31, 2016 to 45 days as of March31, 2017 . The change in net accounts receivable is due t o changes in customer mix and the timing of sales and collections during the quarter. Certain international customers can have longer payment terms than U.S. customers. Other receivables decreased from $15.1 million at December31, 2016 to $13.4 million at March31, 2017 . The decrease in other receivables is primarily attributable to the timing of filing returns and collections of VAT receivables in our international subsidiaries. Other receivables will also fluctuate due to the timing of shipmen ts and collections for materials supplied to our contract manufacturers during the quarter. Quarterly inventory turnover decreased from 3.67 turns as of December 31, 2016 to 3.55 turns at March 31, 2017. Inventory increased 7.3% from December 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017. The increase in inventory at March 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to customer specific projects and volume discount purchases. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to services activity and seasonal cycles of our business, ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory obsolescence that may occur due to rapidly changing technology and customer demand. Accounts payable decreased 3.9% from $77.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $74.3 million at March 31, 2017. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of supplies, inventory and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases. Investing Activities Capital expenditures totaled approximately $3.9 million and $3.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware, software, manufacturing and test equipment, and building improvements. Our combined short-term and long-term investments increased $7.6 million from $219.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $226.9 million at March 31, 2017. This increase reflects funds available for investment provided by our operating activities and stock option exercises by our employees, partially offset by our cash needs for capital expenditures, purchases of treasury stock, and shareholder dividends, as well as net realized and unrealized gains and losses and amortization of net premiums on our combined investments. We invest all available cash not required for immediate use in operations primarily in securities that we believe bear minimal risk of loss. At March 31, 2017 these investments included corporate bonds of $72.3 million, municipal fixed-rate bonds of $11.0 million, asset-backed bonds of $11.8 million, mortgage/agency-backed bonds of $12.3 million, U.S. government bonds of $28.0 million, foreign government bonds of $3.3 million and variable rate demand notes of $10.5 million. At December 31, 2016, these investments included corporate bonds of $66.4 million, municipal fixed-rate bonds of $11.8 million, asset-backed bonds of $10.2 million, mortgage/agency-backed bonds of $13.0 million, U.S. government bonds of $29.8 million, foreign government bonds of $3.7 million and variable rate demand notes of $11.9 million. As of March 31, 2017, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds, foreign government bonds and variable rate demand notes were classified as available-for-sale and had a combined duration of 1.1 years with an average Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating of AA-. Because our bond portfolio has a high quality rating and contractual maturities of a short duration, we are able to obtain prices for these bonds derived from observable market inputs, or for similar securities traded in an active market, on a daily basis. Our long-term investments decreased 1.0% from $176.1 million at December 31, 2016 to $174.4 million at March 31, 2017. Long-term investments at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $27.8 million, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond. See "Debt" below for additional information. We have various equity investments included in long-term investments at a cost of $30.9 million and $30.6 million, and with a fair value of $31.8 million and $29.4 million, at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Long-term investments at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 also included $17.4 million and $14.6 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans, and $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of other investments carried at cost, consisting of interests in two private equity funds and an investment in a privately held telecommunications equipment manufacturer. 28 We review our investment portfolio for potential "other-than-temporary" declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, signif icant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begi n our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% or more for six or more consecutive months. We then evaluate the individual sec urity based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. For the three months ended March 31 , 201 7 and 201 6 , other-than-temporary impairmen t charges were not significant. Financing Activities Dividends In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we paid dividends totaling $4.4 million. Debt We have amounts outstanding under loans made pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond) which totaled $27.8 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. At March 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of the Bond was approximately $27.9 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating of AAA. Included in long-term investments are restricted funds in the amount of $27.8 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, which is a collateral deposit against the principal amount of the Bond. We have the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. The Bond matures on January 1, 2020, and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under this program. We are required to make payments in the amounts necessary to pay the interest on the amounts currently outstanding. It is our intent to make annual principal payments in addition to the interest amounts that are due. In connection with this decision, $1.0 million of the Bond has been classified as a current liability in accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2017. Stock Repurchase Program Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock, which will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we repurchased 0.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $21.44 per share. As of March 31, 2017, we have the authority to purchase an additional 4.2 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors. Stock Option Exercises We issued 0.1 million shares of treasury stock during the three months ended March 31, 2017 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $23.02. We received proceeds totaling $1.4 million from the exercise of these stock options during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, there have been no material changes in contractual obligations and commercial commitments from those discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed on February 24, 2017 with the SEC. We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of March 31, 2017, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. 29ITEM 1.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (In thousands, except per share amounts) 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of ADTRAN , Inc. and its subsidiaries (ADTRAN) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting on Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements are not included herein. The December 31, 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet is derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature. The results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed on February 24, 2017 with the SEC. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Our more significant estimates include the obsolete and excess inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred revenue components of multiple element sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred revenues, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments, and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition , including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASUs in 2016 containing implementation guidance related to ASU 2014-09, including: ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations; ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , which is intended to clarify two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance; ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which contains certain provisions and practical expedients in response to identified implementation issues; and ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is intended to clarify the Codification or to correct unintended application of guidance. ASU 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. We plan to adopt ASU 2014-09 and the related ASUs on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact of these ASUs, and we believe the most significant potential impact relates to our accounting for software license and installation services revenues. We do not believe there will be a significant impact to product or maintenance revenues. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity's leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective approach is required. We anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have a material impact on our financial position; however, we do not believe adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations. We believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for operating leases for office space and equipment. 7 In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangib les Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, entities will be required to comp are the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual or interim impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating whether to early adopt ASU 2017-04, but we do not expect it will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07, Compensation Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (ASU 2017-07). ASU 2017-07 amends ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits , to require employers that present a measure of operating income in their statements of earnings to include only the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in operating expenses (together with other employee compensation costs). The other components of net benefit cost, including amortization of prior service cost/credit, and settlement and curtailment effects, are to be included in non-operating expenses. ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect ASU 2017-07 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. During 2017, we adopted the following accounting standards, which had no material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows: In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (ASU 2015-11). Currently, Topic 330, Inventory , requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. ASU 2015-11 does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. ASU 2015-11 requires an entity to measure in scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We adopted ASU 2015-11 in the first quarter of 2017, and there was no material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we began recognizing all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit as a discrete event. The treatment of forfeitures has changed as we have elected to discontinue our past practice of estimating forfeitures and now account for forfeitures as they occur. As a result, we recorded an increase in additional paid in capital of $0.1 million, a charge to beginning retained earnings of $0.1 million, and an increase in the deferred tax assets related to non-qualified stock options and RSUs of $10 thousand. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows within operating activities. We elected to retrospectively apply the changes in presentation to the statements of cash flows and no longer classify excess tax benefits as a financing activity, which had no effect on our cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016. There was no material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of these changes. 8 2.BUSINESS COMBINATIONS On September 13, 2016, we acquired key fiber access products, technologies and service relationships from subsidiaries of CommScope, Inc. for $0.9 million in cash. This acquisition will enhance our solutions for the cable MSO industry and will provide cable operators with the scalable solutions, services and support they require to compete in the multi-gigabit service delivery market. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. We have included the financial results of this acquisition in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. These revenues are included in the Network Solutions reportable segment, and in the Access &amp; Aggregation and Customer Devices categories. We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $3.5 million during the third quarter of 2016, net of income taxes, subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties. The bargain purchase gain of $3.5 million represents the excess fair value of the net assets acquired over the consideration exchanged. We have assessed the recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on historical and forecasted data for future periods and have concluded that our valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate. The allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, subject to working capital adjustments, is as follows: The details of the acquired intangible assets are as follows: 9 The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015. This unaudited supplemental pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been completed o n January 1, 2015, nor is it indicative of any future results. Aside from revising the 2015 net income for the effect of the bargain purchase gain, there were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively, related to this acquisition. 3. INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rate decreased from 37.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 27.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to a 6.3% effective rate reduction due to a greater mix of international revenues and a 3.2% effective rate reduction for a provision-to-return adjustment related to the assignment of research and development expenditures to specific company engineering locations. 4. PENSION BENEFIT PLAN We maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. The following table summarizes the components of net periodic pension cost for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 5. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, performance stock units (PSUs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, which was recognized as follows: 10 Stock Options The following table is a summary of our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017 and the changes that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2017: The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the closing price of our stock on the last trading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money stock options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on June 30, 2017. The aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of our stock. The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 was $0.1 million and $0.5, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, there was $5.2 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 1.8 years. The fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. There were no stock options granted during the three or six months ended June 30, 2017. The weighted-average assumptions and value of options granted during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were as follows: PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock The following table is a summary of our PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and the changes that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2017: 11 The fair value of our PSUs with market conditions is calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. The fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. During the first quarter of 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a PSU grant of 0.5 million shares that contain performance conditions. The fair value of these performance-based PSU awards was equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. As of June 30, 2017, there was $7.9 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 3.0 years. In addition, there was $11.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested performance-based PSUs, which will be recognized over the requisite service period of three years as achievement of the performance objective becomes probable. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, no compensation expense was recognized related to these performance-based PSU awards. 6. INVESTMENTS At June 30, 2017, we held the following securities and investments, recorded at either fair value or cost: At December 31, 2016, we held the following securities and investments, recorded at either fair value or cost: 12 As of June30, 2017, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds and foreign government bonds had the following contractual mat urities: Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Our investment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total investment portfolio. At June 30, 2017, we held a $27.8 million restricted certificate of deposit, which is carried at cost. This investment serves as a collateral deposit against the principal amount outstanding under loans made to ADTRAN pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond), which totaled $27.8 million at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. At June 30, 2017, the estimated fair value of the Bond using a level 2 valuation technique was approximately $28.0 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard and Poor's credit rating of AAA. We have the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. The Bond matures on January 1, 2020, and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under this program. We are required to make payments in the amounts necessary to pay the interest on the amounts currently outstanding. It is our intent to make annual principal payments in addition to the interest amounts that are due. We review our investment portfolio for potential "other-than-temporary" declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% or more for six or more consecutive months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, other-than-temporary impairment charges were not significant. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method. The following table presents gross realized gains and losses related to our investments. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, gross unrealized losses related to individual securities in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant. 13 We have categorized our cash equivalents held in money market funds and our investments held at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique for the cash equivalents and investments as follows:Level 1 - Values based on unadjusted quoted pr ices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market; Level 2 - Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; Level 3 - Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs include information supplied by investees. 14 The fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety of indu stry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each secu rity. Our variable rate demand notes have a structure that implies a standard expected market price. The frequent interest rate resets make it reasonable to expect the price to stay at par. These securities are priced at the expected market price. 7. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We participate in foreign exchange forward contracts in connection with the management of exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Cash Flow Hedges Our cash flow hedging activities utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the planned purchase of products from foreign suppliers. Purchases of U.S. denominated inventory by our European subsidiary represent our primary exposure. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are not recognized in current operating results, but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. This reclassification is recorded in the same line item of the consolidated statements of income as where the effects of the hedged item are recorded, which is cost of sales. Undesignated Hedges We have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as outstanding non-functional balances are revalued to the functional currency through profit and loss. When appropriate, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to help manage the volatility relating to these valuation exposures. All changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments that do not qualify for or are not designated for hedged accounting transactions are recognized as other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of June 30, 2017, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding with notional amounts totaling $20.0 million ( 17.5 million), which hedge a portion of projected inventory purchases expected to be settled in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. We have determined that there was no hedge ineffectiveness for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 related to these contracts. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. Our derivative instruments are not subject to master netting arrangements and are not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values of our derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows: The change in the fair values of our derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: 15 The change in our derivatives designated as hedging instruments recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and reclassified to income during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 20 16 were as follows: 8. INVENTORY At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, inventory consisted of the following: We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, raw materials reserves totaled $15.2 million and $14.6 million, respectively, and finished goods inventory reserves totaled $12.7 million and $10.6 million, respectively. 9. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill, all of which relates to our acquisition of Bluesocket, Inc., was $3.5 million at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, of which $3.1 million and $0.4 million is allocated to our Network Solutions and Services &amp; Support reportable segments, respectively. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test will be performed. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment in 2016, we concluded that it was not necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. There have been no impairment losses recognized since the acquisition in 2011. Intangible assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and include intangibles acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions of Bluesocket, Inc. on August 4, 2011, the NSN BBA business on May 4, 2012, and CommScope's active fiber access business on September 13, 2016. 16 The following table presents our int angible assets as of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016: Amortization expense, all of which relates to business acquisitions, was $1.1 million and $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 $1.9 million and $0.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, the estimated future amortization expense of our intangible assets is as follows: 10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY A summary of the changes in stockholders' equity for the six months ended June 30, 2017 is as follows: Stock Repurchase Program Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock, which will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $20.27 per share. As of June 30, 2017, we have the authority to purchase an additional 3.6 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors. 17 Stock Option Exercises We issued 0.1 million shares of treasury stock during the six months ended June 30, 2017 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $23.02. We received proceeds totaling $1.7 million from the exercise of these stock options during the six months ended June 30, 2017. Dividend Payments During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we paid cash dividends as follows (in thousands except per share amounts): Other Comprehensive Income Other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, reclassification adjustments for amounts included in net income related to impairments of available-for-sale securities, realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, realized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, and amortization of actuarial gains (losses) related to our defined benefit plan, defined benefit plan adjustments, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The following tables present the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, by component for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016: 18 The following tables present the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, by component for the six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016: 19 The following tables present the details of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the three months ended June30, 2017 and 2016: (1) Included in the computation of net periodic pension cost.

EARNINGS PER SHARE A summary of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: Anti-dilutive options to purchase common stock outstanding were excluded from the above calculations. Anti-dilutive options totaled 4.1 million and 5.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 4.1 million and 5.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 12. SEGMENT INFORMATION We operate in two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions and (2) Services &amp; Support. Network Solutions includes hardware products and next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior-generation products. Services &amp; Support includes our suite of ProCloud managed services, network installation, engineering and maintenance services, and fee-based technical support and equipment repair/replacement plans. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on gross profit; therefore, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, interest and dividend income, interest expense, net realized investment gain/loss, other income/expense and provision for taxes are reported on a company-wide, functional basis only. There are no inter-segment revenues. The following table presents information about the reported sales and gross profit of our reportable segments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. We do not produce asset information by reportable segment; therefore, it is not reported. 23 Sales by Category In addition to our reporting segments, we also report revenue for the following three categories Access & Aggregation, Customer Devices, and Traditional & Other Products. The table below presents sales information by category for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016: 13. LIABILITY FOR WARRANTY RETURNS Our products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $9.2 million and $8.5 million at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a receivable and a reduction in warranty expense related to a settlement with a third party supplier for a defective component, the impact of which is reflected in the table below. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. A summary of warranty expense and write-off activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent claims, disputes over contract agreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek damages or other relief, such as royalty payments related to patents, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. Although the outcome of any claim or litigation can never be certain, it is our opinion that the outcome of all contingencies of which we are currently aware will not materially affect our business, operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of June 30, 2017, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. 15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On July 18, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 3, 2017. The payment date will be August 17, 2017. The quarterly dividend payment will be approximately $4.3 million. In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. 24 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CO NDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. OVERVIEW ADTRAN, Inc. is a leading global provider of networking and communications equipment. Our solutions enable voice, data, video and Internet communications across a variety of network infrastructures. These solutions are deployed by many of the United States' and the world's largest communications service providers (CSPs), distributed enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses, public and private enterprises, and millions of individual users worldwide. Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors. An important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then lower the product's selling price based on the cost savings achieved in order to gain market share and/or improve gross margins. As a part of this strategy, we seek in most instances to be a high-quality, low-cost provider of products in our markets. Our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign, allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation. This strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers, while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers. We report revenue for the following three categories Access & Aggregation, Customer Devices, and Traditional & Other Products. Access &amp; Aggregation solutions are used by CSPs to connect their network infrastructure to their subscribers. This category includes software and hardware-based products and services that aggregate and/or originate access technologies. The portfolio of ADTRAN solutions within this category includes a wide array of modular or fixed physical form factors designed to deliver the best technology and economic fit based on the target subscriber density and environmental conditions. The Access &amp; Aggregation category includes product and service families such as: Total Access 5000 Series Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) and Fiber to the Node (FTTN) Multi-Service Access Nodes (MSAN) hiX 5600 Series fiber aggregation and FTTN MSAN Fiber to the Distribution Point (FTTdp) G.fast Optical Network Units (ONU) GPON, EPON and 10G PON Optical Line Terminals (OLT) SDX Fiber Access network elements Optical Networking Edge (ONE) aggregation IP Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) Cabinet and Outside-Plant (OSP) enclosures and services Network Management and Cloud-based software platforms and applications Pluggable optical transceivers (i.e., SFP, SFP+, XFP, QSFP), cables and other miscellaneous materials Planning, engineering, program management, maintenance, installation and commissioning services to implement customer network solutions Other products and services that are generally applicable to Access & Aggregation 25 Customer Devices includes our products and services that provide end users access to CSP networks. Our Customer Devices portfolio includes a comprehensive array of service provider and enterprise hardware and software products and services. The Customer Devices category includes products and services such as: Broadband customer premise solutions, including Passive Optical Network (PON) and point-to-point Ethernet Optical Network Terminals (ONTs) Radio Frequency over Glass (RFoG) MicroNodes Residential and business gateways Wi-Fi access points and associated powering and switching infrastructure enterprise Session Border Controllers (eSBC) Branch office and access routers Carrier Ethernet services termination devices VoIP media gateways ProServices pre-sale and post-sale technical support Planning, engineering, program management, maintenance, installation and commissioning services to implement the customer devices solutions into consumer, small business and enterprise locations Other products and services that are generally applicable to customer devices Traditional &amp; Other Products generally includes a mix of prior generation technologies' products and services, as well as other products and services that do not fit within the Access & Aggregation or Customer Devices categories. The Traditional &amp; Other Products category includes products and services such as: Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) based aggregation systems and customer devices HDSL, ADSL and other mature technologies used to deliver business and residential services over the CSP access and customer networks Other products and services that do not fit within the Access & Aggregation and Customer Devices categories See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information regarding these product categories. Sales were $184.7 million and $355.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $162.7 million and $304.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. Our gross margin decreased to 45.8% and 44.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, from 48.5% and 47.5% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. Our operating income margin decreased to 8.9% and 6.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, from 9.1% and 6.7% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. Net income was $12.4 million and $19.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $10.2 million and $15.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. Our effective tax rate decreased to 30.6% and 27.3% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, from 37.8% and 37.9% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.26 and $0.39 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $0.21 and $0.31 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. Our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past, and may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors, including customer order activity and backlog. Backlog levels vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other factors that affect customer order lead times. Many of our customers require prompt delivery of products. This requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand. If near-term demand for our products declines, or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated, our financial results could be adversely affected. Operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter. 26 Our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market c onditions, foreign currency exchange rate movements, increased competition, customer order patterns, changes in product and services mix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs and announcements of new products by us or our competitors. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Also, not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements, which may negatively impact our operating results in a given quarter. Accordingly, our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and, in general, management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period. Factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results are included in Item 1A of Part I in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed on February 24, 2017 with the SEC. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed significantly from those detailed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed on February 24, 2017 with the SEC. EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2017 COMPARED TO THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 SALES Our sales increased 13.5% from $162.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $184.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and increased 16.4% from $304.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $355.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in sales for the three months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to a $36.4 million increase in sales of our Access &amp; Aggregation products, partially offset by a $7.4 million decrease in sales of our Traditional &amp; Other Products and a $7.0 million decrease in sales of our Customer Devices products. The increase in sales for the six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to a $62.7 million increase in sales of our Access &amp; Aggregation products, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease in sales of our Traditional &amp; Other Products and a $3.1 million decrease in sales of our Customer Devices products. Network Solutions sales increased 12.3% from $138.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $155.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and increased 14.0% from $262.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $299.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of Access &amp; Aggregation products, partially offset by a decrease in sales of Customer Devices products and Traditional &amp; Other Products. The increase in sales of our Access &amp; Aggregation products for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to increased VDSL2 vectoring product sales in the U.S. and European carrier markets. The decrease in sales of our Customer Devices products is primarily attributable to decreased EFM NTE product sales, which were primarily impacted by an accelerated Ethernet infrastructure build that occurred in the second quarter of 2016. While we expect that revenues from Traditional &amp; Other Products will continue to decline over time, these revenues may fluctuate and continue for years because of the time required for our customers to transition to newer technologies. Services &amp; Support sales increased 20.6% from $24.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $29.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and increased 31.4% from $42.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $55.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in network installation services for Access &amp; Aggregation products. International sales, which are included in the Network Solutions and Services &amp; Support amounts discussed above, increased 30.5% from $29.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $38.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and increased 62.0% from $54.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $89.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. International sales, as a percentage of total sales, increased from 17.9% and 18.0% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, to 20.6% and 25.1% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. Our international revenues are affected to a great extent by the timing of network upgrade projects at our larger European customers and by changes in foreign exchange rates in territories in which we sell our products and services. In first quarter 2017, international network upgrades resumed; whereas, in 2016 our largest European customer focused on completing network upgrade activities in regions outside of our footprint with them. 27 COST OF SALES As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 51.5% in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to 54.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and increased from 52.5% in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 55.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, services and support mix and an increase in warranty expense. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix and services and support mix. Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment's sales, increased from 49.0% in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to 51.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and increased from 50.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 52.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix and an increase in warranty expense. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift and customer and product mix. Services &amp; Support cost of sales, as a percent of that segment's sales, increased from 65.8% in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to 70.0% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and increased from 66.5% in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 72.2% in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in network installation services during 2017, which have higher costs, as opposed to a greater mix of maintenance and support services, which have lower costs. An important part of our strategy is to reduce the product cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product's price based on the cost savings achieved. This may cause variations in our gross profit percentage due to timing differences between the recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5.5% from $32.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $34.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and increased 9.1% from $63.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $69.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to increases in deferred compensation expense and ERP implementation expenses. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to increases in ERP implementation expenses, deferred compensation expense, travel expense and performance and equity-based compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease in commission expense. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 20.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to 18.8% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and decreased from 20.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 19.6% in the six months ended June 30, 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Research and development expenses increased 7.1% from $31.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $33.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and increased 7.7% from $60.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $65.4 million in the six month ended June 30, 2017. The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in labor and engineering materials related to customer specific projects and amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016. The increase in research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016, labor and engineering materials cost related to customer specific projects and contract services. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased from 19.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to 18.1% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and decreased from 19.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 18.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2017. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities or a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared. We expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products and our expansion into international markets. We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development efforts which provides for new product development, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group. 28 INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME Interest and dividend income increased 4.9% from $0.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $1.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and increased 6.9% from $1.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $1.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in interest and dividend income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in the rate of return on fixed income investments. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2017, and $0.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2017, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information on our revenue bond. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN Net realized investment gains increased 25.2% from $1.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $1.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and decreased 34.5% from $2.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $1.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in realized investment gains for the three months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to increased gains on our deferred compensation plans, partially offset by decreased gains from the sale of equity securities. The decrease in realized investment gains for the six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to decreased gains from the sale of equity securities, partially offset by increased gains on our deferred compensation plans. See "Investing Activities" in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET Other income (expense), net, comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts, investment account management fees, and scrap raw material sales, increased 220.3% from $0.3 million of expense in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $0.8 million of expense in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and increased 470.5% from $0.1 million of expense in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $0.8 million of expense in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in other expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to increased losses on our foreign exchange contracts. INCOME TAXES Our effective tax rate decreased from 37.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 27.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to a 6.3% effective rate reduction due to a greater mix of international revenues and a 3.2% effective rate reduction for a provision-to-return adjustment related to the assignment of research and development expenditures to specific company engineering locations. NET INCOME As a result of the above factors, net income increased $2.2 million from $10.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $12.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and increased $3.8 million from $15.2 million in the six month ended June 30, 2016 to $19.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. As a percentage of sales, net income increased from 6.3% in the three months ended June 30, 2016 to 6.7% in the three months ended June 30, 2017, and increased from 5.0% in the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 5.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2017. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, the cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. 29 At June30, 2017, cash on hand was $88.8 million and short-term investments were $47.3million, which resulted in availa ble short-term liquidity of $136.1million, of which $56.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. At December31, 2016, cash on hand was $79.9 million and short-term investments were $43.2 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $123.1million, of which $42.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S. and our current business plans do not indicate a need to repatriate to fund domestic operations. The increase in sh ort-term liquidity from December31, 2016 to June30, 2017 is primarily attributable to shifts among available investment option tenures to provide funds for our short-term cash needs. Operating Activities Our working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, increased 9.2% from $226.4 million as of December 31, 2016 to $247.2 million as of June 30, 2017, and our current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, increased from 2.79 as of December 31, 2016 to 3.04 as of June 30, 2017. The increase in our working capital and current ratio is primarily attributable to an increase in inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued wages and benefits, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in income tax payable. The quick ratio, defined as cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and net accounts receivable, divided by current liabilities, increased from 1.70 as of December 31, 2016 to 1.79 as of June 30, 2017. The increase in the quick ratio is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued wages and benefits, partially offset by an increase in income tax payable. Accounts receivable decreased 13.5% from $92.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $79.9 million at June 30, 2017. We had no allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2016 or June 30, 2017. Quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased from 52 days as of December 31, 2016 to 39 days as of June 30, 2017. The change in net accounts receivable is due to changes in customer mix and the timing of sales and collections during the quarter. Certain international customers can have longer payment terms than U.S. customers. Other receivables decreased from $15.1 million at December 31, 2016 to $14.6 million at June 30, 2017. The decrease in other receivables is primarily attributable to the timing of filing returns and collections of VAT receivables in our international subsidiaries. Other receivables will also fluctuate due to the timing of shipments and collections for materials supplied to our contract manufacturers during the quarter. Quarterly inventory turnover decreased from 3.67 turns as of December 31, 2016 to 3.53 turns at June 30, 2017. Inventory increased 8.4% from December 31, 2016 to June 30, 2017. The increase in inventory at June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to customer specific projects. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to services activity and seasonal cycles of our business, ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory obsolescence that may occur due to rapidly changing technology and customer demand. Accounts payable decreased 14.5% from $77.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $66.2 million at June 30, 2017. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of supplies, inventory and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases. Investing Activities Capital expenditures totaled approximately $7.5 million and $6.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware, software, manufacturing and test equipment, and building improvements. Our combined short-term and long-term investments decreased $12.3 million from $219.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $207.0 million at June 30, 2017. This decrease reflects our cash needs for capital expenditures, purchases of treasury stock, and shareholder dividends partially offset by funds available for investment provided by our operating activities and stock option exercises by our employees, as well as net realized and unrealized gains and losses and amortization of net premiums on our combined investments. We invest all available cash not required for immediate use in operations primarily in securities that we believe bear minimal risk of loss. At June 30, 2017 these investments included corporate bonds of $73.0 million, municipal fixed-rate bonds of $7.6 million, asset-backed bonds of $13.3 million, mortgage/agency-backed bonds of $9.5 million, U.S. government bonds of $21.4 million, and foreign government bonds of $2.7 million. At December 31, 2016, these investments included corporate bonds of $66.4 million, municipal fixed-rate bonds of $11.8 million, asset-backed bonds of $10.2 million, mortgage/agency-backed bonds of $13.0 million, U.S. government bonds of $29.8 million, foreign government bonds of $3.7 million and variable rate demand notes of $11.9 million. As of June 30, 2017, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds, and foreign government bonds were classified as available-for-sale and had a combined duration of 0.9 years with an average Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating of A+. Because our bond portfolio has a high quality rating and contractual maturities of a short duration, we are able to obtain prices for these bonds derived from observable market inputs, or for similar securities traded in an active market, on a daily basis. 30 Our long-term investments decreased 9.4% from $176.1 million at December 31, 2016 to $159.6 million at June30, 2017. Long-term investments at June30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $27.8 million, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond. See "Debt" below for additional information. We have vario us equity investments included in long-term investments at a cost of $31.7million and $30.6million, and with a fair value of $33.0million and $29.4million, at June30, 2017 and December31, 2016, respectively. Long-term investments at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 also included $18.0 million and $14.6 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans, and $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of other investments carried at cost, consisting of interests in two private equity funds and an investment in a privately held telecommunications equipment manufacturer. We review our investment portfolio for potential "other-than-temporary" declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% or more for six or more consecutive months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, other-than-temporary impairment charges were not significant. Financing Activities Dividends In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we paid dividends totaling $8.7 million. Debt We have amounts outstanding under loans made pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond) which totaled $27.8 million at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. At June 30, 2017, the estimated fair value of the Bond was approximately $28.0 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating of AAA. Included in long-term investments are restricted funds in the amount of $27.8 million at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, which is a collateral deposit against the principal amount of the Bond. We have the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. The Bond matures on January 1, 2020, and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under this program. We are required to make payments in the amounts necessary to pay the interest on the amounts currently outstanding. It is our intent to make annual principal payments in addition to the interest amounts that are due. In connection with this decision, $1.0 million of the Bond has been classified as a current liability in accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2017. Stock Repurchase Program Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock, which will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $20.27 per share. As of June 30, 2017, we have the authority to purchase an additional 3.6 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors. Stock Option Exercises We issued 0.1 million shares of treasury stock during the six months ended June 30, 2017 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $23.02. We received proceeds totaling $1.7 million from the exercise of these stock options during the six months ended June 30, 2017. 31 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, there have been no material changes in contractual obligations and commercial commitments from those discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed on February 24, 2017 with the SEC. We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of June 30, 2017, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. 32
