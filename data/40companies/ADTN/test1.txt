NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Unaudited)  (In thousands, except per share amounts)  1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of ADTRAN  , Inc. and its subsidiaries (ADTRAN) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting on Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements are not included herein. The December 31, 2014 Consolidated Balance Sheet is derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature. The results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed on February 24, 2015 with the SEC.  Changes in Classifications  We reclassified $2.3 million from other receivables to accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 to conform to the current period presentation.  Out of Period Adjustment  In connection with the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded corrections of certain out of period, immaterial misstatements that occurred in prior periods, the most significant of which resulted in an increase in Other Expense of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2015. The aggregate impact of the corrections was a $0.8 million reduction to pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and is not expected to be material to the current year annual results.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Our more significant estimates include the obsolete and excess inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred revenue components of multiple element sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred revenues, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments, and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition , including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. We are currently evaluating the transition method that will be elected and the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.     7     In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-05, Intangibles   Goodwill and Other   Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (ASU 2015-05), which provides guidance on accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or retrospectively. We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2015-05 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (ASU 2015-11) . Currently, Topic 330, Inventory, requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. ASU2015-11 does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. ASU 2015-11 requires an entity to measure in scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2015-05 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  2. INCOME TAXES  Our effective tax rate increased from 31.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 36.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the release of a valuation allowance attributable to a foreign subsidiary in 2014, partially offset by settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes in 2015.  3. PENSION BENEFIT PLAN  We maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries.  The following table summarizes the components of net periodic pension cost for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:         8     4. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, which was recognized as follows:      The fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate.  There were no options granted during the three months ended September 30, 2014. The weighted-average assumptions and value of options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014 are as follows:      The fair value of our RSUs is calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. No RSUs were granted or vested during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. Twelve thousand RSUs were forfeited during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The fair value of restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. No restricted stock was granted or forfeited during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. Two thousand shares of restricted stock vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 is based on options, RSUs and restricted stock ultimately expected to vest, and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures for stock options are based upon historical experience and approximate 3.3% annually. We estimated a 0% forfeiture rate for our RSUs and restricted stock due to the limited number of recipients and historical experience for these awards.     9     As of September 30, 2015, total compensation expense related to non-vested stock options, RSUs and restricted stock not yet recognized was approximately $10.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.4 years.  The following table is a summary of our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 and the changes that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015:      The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the closing price of our stock on the last trading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on September 30, 2015. The aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of our stock.  The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $4 thousand and $0.1 million, respectively.     10     5. INVESTMENTS  At September 30, 2015, we held the following securities and investments, recorded at either fair value or cost.      At December 31, 2014, we held the following securities and investments, recorded at either fair value or cost.         11     As of September 30, 2015, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, and government bonds had the following contractual maturities:      Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  Our investment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total investment portfolio.  At September 30, 2015, we held a $30.0 million restricted certificate of deposit, which is carried at cost. This investment serves as a collateral deposit against the principal amount outstanding under loans made to ADTRAN pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond). At September 30, 2015, the estimated fair value of the Bond using a level 2 valuation technique was approximately $30.1 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard and Poor s credit rating of AAA. For more information on the Bond, see  Debt  under  Liquidity and Capital Resources  in the  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  contained in Item 2 of Part I of this report.  We review our investment portfolio for potential  other-than-temporary  declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% or more for six or more consecutive months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, other-than-temporary impairment charges were not significant.  Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method. The following table presents gross realized gains and losses related to our investments.      As of September 30, 2015 and 2014, gross unrealized losses related to individual securities in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant.     12     We have categorized our cash equivalents held in money market funds and our investments held at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique for the cash equivalents and investments as follows: Level 1 - Values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market; Level 2 - Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; Level 3 - Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs include information supplied by investees.         13      The fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each security.  Our municipal variable rate demand notes have a structure that implies a standard expected market price. The frequent interest rate resets make it reasonable to expect the price to stay at par. These securities are priced at the expected market price.  6. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES  We have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. When appropriate, we enter into various derivative transactions to enhance our ability to manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. Our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, and accordingly, all changes in the fair value of the instruments are recognized as other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The maximum contractual period for our derivatives is currently less than twelve months. Our derivative instruments are not subject to master netting arrangements and are not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of September 30, 2015, we had forward contracts outstanding with notional amounts totaling  7.1 million ($8.0 million), which mature in the fourth quarter of 2015.     14     The fair values of our derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were as follows:      The change in the fair values of our derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:      7. INVENTORY  At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, inventory consisted of the following:      We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, raw materials reserves totaled $16.3 million and $16.9 million, respectively, and finished goods inventory reserves totaled $8.3 million and $7.8 million, respectively.  8. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Goodwill, all of which relates to our acquisition of Bluesocket, Inc. and is included in our Enterprise Networks division, was $3.5 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test will be performed. There have been no impairment losses recorded since acquisition.  Intangible assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and include intangibles acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions of Objectworld Communications Corporation on September 15, 2009, Bluesocket, Inc. on August 4, 2011, and the NSN BBA business on May 4, 2012.     15     The following table presents our intangible assets as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014:      Amortization expense, all of which relates to business acquisitions, was $0.5 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $1.5 million and $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  As of September 30, 2015, the estimated future amortization expense of our intangible assets is as follows:      9. STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY  A summary of the changes in stockholders  equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is as follows:      Stock Repurchase Program  Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased 3.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.69 per share. As of September 30, 2015, we have the authority to purchase an additional 5.8 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors.     16     Stock Option Exercises  We issued 0.1 million shares of treasury stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $22.53. We received proceeds totaling $0.9 million from the exercise of these stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Dividend Payments  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we paid cash dividends as follows (in thousands except per share amounts):      Other Comprehensive Income  Other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, reclassification adjustments for amounts included in net income related to impairments of available-for-sale securities, realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, and amortization of actuarial gains (losses) related to our defined benefit plan, defined benefit plan adjustments, and foreign currency translation adjustments.  The following tables present changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, by component for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:         17      The following tables present changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, by component for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:             18     The following tables present the details of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:           (1)  Included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

EARNINGS PER SHARE  A summary of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:      Anti-dilutive options to purchase common stock outstanding were excluded from the above calculations. Anti-dilutive options totaled 6.0 million and 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 6.1 million and 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  11. SEGMENT INFORMATION  We operate in two reportable segments: (1) the Carrier Networks Division and (2) the Enterprise Networks Division. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on gross profit; therefore, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, interest and dividend income, interest expense, net realized investment gain/loss, other income/expense and provision for taxes are reported on an entity-wide basis only. There are no inter-segment revenues.  The following tables present information about the reported sales and gross profit of our reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. Asset information by reportable segment is not reported, since we do not produce such information internally.         21     Sales by Product  Our three major product categories are Carrier Systems, Business Networking and Loop Access.  Carrier Systems products are used by communications service providers to provide data, voice, and video services to consumers and enterprises. This category includes the following product areas and related services:                Broadband Access                Total Access  5000 Series of Multi-Service Access Node (MSAN)                hiX 5600 Series of MSANs                Total Access 1100/1200 Series of Fiber to the Node (FTTN) products                hiX 1100 Series of Fiber to the Node (FTTN) products                VDSL2 Vectoring based Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) products                ADTRAN 500 Series of FTTdp G.fast Distribution Point Units (DPU)                Optical                Optical Networking Edge (ONE)                NetVanta 8000 Series of Fiber Ethernet Access Devices (EAD)                NetVanta 8400 Series of 10Gig Multi-service Edge Switches                OPTI-6100 and Total Access 3000 optical Multi-Service Provisioning Platforms (MSPP)                Pluggable Optical Products, including SFP, XFP, and SFP+                Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) systems  Business Networking products provide access to communication services and facilitate the delivery of cloud connectivity and enterprise communications to the small and mid-sized enterprise (SME) market. This category includes the following product areas and related services:                Internetworking products                Total Access IP Business Gateways                Optical Network Terminals (ONTs)                Bluesocket  virtual Wireless LAN (vWLAN  )                NetVanta                  Access Routers                Enterprise Session Border Controllers (eSBC)                Managed Ethernet Switches                IP Business Gateways                Unified Communications (UC) solutions                Carrier Ethernet Network Terminating Equipment (NTE)                Carrier Ethernet Routers and Gateways                Network Management Solutions  Loop Access products are used by carrier and enterprise customers for access to copper-based communications networks. This category includes the following product areas and related services:                High bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line (HDSL) products                Digital Data Service (DDS)                Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) products                T1/E1/T3 Channel Service Units/Data Service Units (CSUs/DSUs)                TRACER fixed-wireless products     22     The table below presents sales information by product category for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:      In addition, we identify subcategories of product revenues, which we divide into core products and legacy products. Our core products consist of Broadband Access and Optical products (included in Carrier Systems), and Internetworking products (included in Business Networking). Our legacy products include HDSL products (included in Loop Access) and other products not included in the aforementioned core products.  The table below presents subcategory revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:      12. LIABILITY FOR WARRANTY RETURNS  Our products generally include warranties of 90 days to ten years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $8.7 million and $8.4 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.     23     A summary of warranty expense and write-off activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:      13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  During 2014, we employed the law firm of our director emeritus for legal services. All bills for services rendered by this firm were reviewed and approved by our Chief Financial Officer. We believe that the fees for such services were comparable to those charged by other firms for services rendered to us. The services of our director emeritus ended with his death on September 7, 2014. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, we incurred fees of $10 thousand and $70 thousand, respectively, for these legal services.  14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent claims, disputes over contract agreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek damages or other relief, such as royalty payments related to patents, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. Although the outcome of any claim or litigation can never be certain, it is our opinion that the outcome of all contingencies of which we are currently aware will not materially affect our business, operations, financial condition or cash flows.  We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of September 30, 2015, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments.  15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  On October 13, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 29, 2015. The payment date will be November 12, 2015. The quarterly dividend payment will be approximately $4.5 million. In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity.     24     
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document.  OVERVIEW  ADTRAN, Inc. is a leading global provider of networking and communications equipment. Our solutions enable voice, data, video and Internet communications across a variety of network infrastructures. These solutions are deployed by some of the world s largest service providers, distributed enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses, public and private enterprises, and millions of individual users worldwide.  Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors. An important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then lower the product s selling price based on the cost savings achieved in order to gain market share and/or improve gross margins. As a part of this strategy, we seek in most instances to be a high-quality, low-cost provider of products in our markets. Our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign, allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation. This strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers, while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers.  Our three major product categories are Carrier Systems, Business Networking and Loop Access.  Carrier Systems products are used by communications service providers to provide data, voice, and video services to consumers and enterprises.

This category includes the following product areas and related services:                High bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line (HDSL) products                Digital Data Service (DDS)                Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) products                T1/E1/T3 Channel Service Units/Data Service Units (CSUs/DSUs)                TRACER fixed-wireless products  In addition, we identify subcategories of product revenues, which we divide into core products and legacy products. Our core products consist of Broadband Access and Optical products (included in Carrier Systems) and Internetworking products (included in Business Networking). Our legacy products include HDSL products (included in Loop Access) and other products not included in the aforementioned core products. Many of our customers are migrating their networks to deliver higher bandwidth services by utilizing newer technologies. We believe that products and services offered in our core product areas position us well for this migration. As a result of this migration, revenues of our legacy products, including HDSL, have decreased significantly. Despite occasional increases, we anticipate revenues of our legacy products, including HDSL, will continue to decline over time.  See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information regarding these product categories.  Sales were $158.1 million and $461.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to $162.9 million and $486.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Product revenues for our three core areas, Broadband Access, Optical and Internetworking, were $146.0 million and $427.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to $148.4 million and $444.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Our gross margin decreased to 44.7% and 44.3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 from 48.0% and 50.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Our operating income margin decreased to 5.1% and 2.3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 from 7.7% and 8.9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Net income was $7.1 million and $12.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $11.3 million and $35.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Our effective tax rate increased to 35.0% and 36.9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 from 24.8% and 31.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.14 and $0.25 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $0.21 and $0.63 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014.     26     Our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past, and may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors, including customer order activity and backlog. Backlog levels vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other factors that affect customer order lead times. Many of our customers require prompt delivery of products. This requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand. If near-term demand for our products declines, or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated, our financial results could be adversely affected. Operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter.  Our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate movements, increased competition, customer order patterns, changes in product and services mix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs and announcements of new products by us or our competitors. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Also, not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements, which may negatively impact our operating results in a given quarter.  Accordingly, our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and, in general, management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period. A list of factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results is included under  Factors That Could Affect Our Future Results  in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  contained in Item 2 of Part I of this report. These factors have also been discussed in more detail in Item 1A of Part I in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed on February 24, 2015 with the SEC.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed significantly from those detailed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed on February 24, 2015 with the SEC.  EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 COMPARED TO THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2014  SALES  ADTRAN s sales decreased 3.0% from $162.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $158.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased 5.1% from $486.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $461.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a $2.4 million decrease in sales of our HDSL and other legacy products and a $2.0 million decrease in sales of our Broadband Access products. The decrease in sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to an $11.1 million decrease in sales of our Internetworking products, a $7.9 million decrease in sales of our HDSL and other legacy products, and a $6.3 million decrease in sales of our Broadband Access products.     27     Carrier Networks sales decreased 1.3% from $133.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $131.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased 3.0% from $394.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $382.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to decreases in sales of our Broadband Access products and sales of our HDSL and other legacy products, partially offset by an increase in sales of our Internetworking products. The decrease in sales of our Broadband Access products is primarily attributable to decreased sales in the EMEA region and the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. The decrease in sales of HDSL and other legacy products has been expected as customers continue to upgrade their networks to deliver higher bandwidth services by migrating to newer technologies, including to our core products from our Broadband Access, Internetworking and Optical product lines. While we expect that revenues from HDSL and our other legacy products will continue to decline over time, these revenues may fluctuate and continue for years because of the time required for our customers to transition to newer technologies. The increase in sales of Internetworking products for this division is primarily attributable to increased sales of our FTTP ONT products.  Enterprise Networks sales decreased 10.4% from $29.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $26.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased 14.3% from $91.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $78.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to decreases in sales of our Internetworking products. The decrease in sales of our Internetworking products for this division was primarily attributable to weakness in our IP gateway product segment. Internetworking product sales attributable to Enterprise Networks were 93.8% and 93.6% of the division s sales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to 93.4% and 94.2% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Legacy products primarily comprise the remainder of Enterprise Networks sales. Enterprise Networks sales as a percentage of total sales decreased from 18.4% and 18.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 17.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  International sales, which are included in the Carrier Networks and Enterprise Networks amounts discussed above, decreased 40.0% from $64.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $38.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased 22.3% from $197.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $153.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. International sales, as a percentage of total sales, decreased from 39.5% and 40.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 24.4% and 33.3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in international sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales in the EMEA region and the Asia-Pacific region, partially offset by an increase in sales in Latin America. The decrease in international sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales in the EMEA region, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. The decrease in sales in the EMEA region is primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Carrier System product sales decreased $2.9 million from $114.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $111.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased $11.8 million from $342.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $330.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a $2.0 million decrease in Broadband Access product sales and a $1.0 million decrease in legacy product sales. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a $6.3 million decrease in Broadband Access product sales and a $5.9 million decrease in legacy product sales. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are primarily attributable to the factors discussed above.  Business Networking product sales decreased $0.6 million from $39.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $39.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased $10.9 million from $119.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $108.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a $0.5 million decrease in Internetworking product sales. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to an $11.1 million decrease in Internetworking product sales. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are primarily attributable to the factors discussed above.     28     Loop Access product sales decreased $1.3 million from $9.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $7.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased $2.3 million from $24.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $21.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a $1.0 million decrease in HDSL product sales. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a $1.6 million decrease in HDSL product sales. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are primarily attributable to the factors discussed above.  COST OF SALES  As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 52.0% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to 55.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased from 50.0% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 55.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, growth in our service-related sales in the U.S. market, and customer mix. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, growth in our service-related sales in the U.S. market, and product mix.  Carrier Networks cost of sales, as a percent of division sales, increased from 53.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to 57.5% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased from 51.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 58.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, growth in service-related sales in our U.S. market, customer mix, and customer price movements to achieve market share position.  Enterprise Networks cost of sales, as a percent of division sales, remained consistent at 44.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, and increased from 43.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 43.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to the shift in product and services mix.  An important part of our strategy is to reduce the product cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product s price based on the cost savings achieved. This may cause variations in our gross profit percentage due to timing differences between the recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 7.5% from $32.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $30.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased 7.0% from $100.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $93.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to decreases in compensation expense and travel expense, partially offset by restructuring charges. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to decreases in compensation expense, legal expense, and independent contractor expense, partially offset by restructuring charges.  As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 19.9% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to 19.0% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased from 20.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 20.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared.     29     RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  Research and development expenses decreased 2.3% from $33.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $32.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased 1.0% from $99.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $100.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation expense, partially offset by restructuring charges and an increase in engineering and testing expense. These restructuring charges were primary attributable to the consolidation of engineering resources. The increase in research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to restructuring charges and an increase in engineering and testing expense, partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense.  As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased from 20.5% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to 20.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased from 20.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 21.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities or a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared.  We expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products and our expansion into international markets. We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development efforts which provides for new product development, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group.  INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME  Interest and dividend income decreased 15.4% from $1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $0.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased 19.8% from $3.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $2.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decreases in interest and dividend income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are primarily attributable to a reduction in investment principal.  INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, and $0.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and $0.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing. See  Liquidity and Capital Resources  below for additional information on our revenue bond.  NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN  Net realized investment gain decreased 23.3% from $2.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $2.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased 16.8% from $7.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $8.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in realized investment gains for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to decreased gains from the sale of equity securities. The increase in realized investment gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to increased gains from the sale of equity securities in the first two quarters of 2015. See  Investing Activities  in  Liquidity and Capital Resources  below for additional information.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  Other income (expense), net, comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, investment account management fees, and scrap raw material sales, changed from $1.0 million of expense in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $0.1 million of income in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and changed from $1.6 million of expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $0.8 million of expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to gains on foreign currency transactions during the third quarter of 2015.     30     INCOME TAXES  Our effective tax rate increased from 31.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 36.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the release of a valuation allowance attributable to a foreign subsidiary in 2014, partially offset by settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes in 2015.  NET INCOME  As a result of the above factors, net income decreased $4.3 million from $11.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $7.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased $22.4 million from $35.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $12.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  As a percentage of sales, net income decreased from 7.0% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to 4.5% in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased from 7.3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to 2.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Liquidity  We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, the cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.  At September 30, 2015, cash on hand was $83.7 million and short-term investments were $42.1 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $125.8 million. At December 31, 2014, our cash on hand of $73.4 million and short-term investments of $46.9 million resulted in available short-term liquidity of $120.4 million. The increase in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2014 to September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to a reallocation of our investments to provide additional funds for our short-term cash needs, which includes operating activities, capital expenditures, purchase of treasury stock, and shareholder dividends.  Operating Activities  Our working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, decreased 0.9% from $232.1 million as of December 31, 2014 to $229.9 million as of September 30, 2015. The quick ratio, defined as cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and net accounts receivable, divided by current liabilities, decreased from 1.75 as of December 31, 2014 to 1.67 as of September 30, 2015. The current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, decreased from 2.95 as of December 31, 2014 to 2.81 as of September 30, 2015. The changes in our working capital, quick ratio and current ratio are primarily attributable to increases in cash and inventory, and a decrease in unearned revenue, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in short-term investments.  Net accounts receivable decreased 2.6% from $88.5 million at December 31, 2014 to $86.2 million at September 30, 2015. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.1 million at December 31, 2014 and $21 thousand at September 30, 2015. Quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased from 57 days as of December 31, 2014 to 50 days as of September 30, 2015. The change in net accounts receivable is due to changes in customer mix and the timing of sales and collections during the quarter. Certain international customers can have longer payment terms than U.S. customers. Other receivables decreased from $33.3 million at December 31, 2014 to $20.9 million at September 30, 2015. The decrease in other receivables is primarily attributable to the timing of filing returns and collections of VAT receivables in our international subsidiaries. Other receivables will also fluctuate due to the timing of shipments and collections for materials supplied to our contract manufacturers during the quarter.     31     Quarterly inventory turnover stayed consistent at 3.5 turns as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015. Inventory increased 16.1% from December 31, 2014 to September 30, 2015. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to services activity and seasonal cycles of our business, ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory obsolescence that may occur due to rapidly changing technology and customer demand.  Accounts payable increased 23.0% from $56.4 million at December 31, 2014 to $69.4 million at September 30, 2015. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of supplies, inventory and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases.  Investing Activities  Capital expenditures totaled approximately $7.8 million and $8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase manufacturing and test equipment and computer software and hardware.  Our combined short-term and long-term investments decreased $81.0 million from $327.6 million at December 31, 2014 to $246.6 million at September 30, 2015. This decrease reflects the impact of our cash needs for capital expenditures, share repurchases, and dividends, as well as net realized and unrealized losses and amortization of net premiums on our combined investments, partially offset by additional funds available for investment provided by our operating activities and stock option exercises by our employees.  We invest all available cash not required for immediate use in operations primarily in securities that we believe bear minimal risk of loss. At September 30, 2015 these investments included corporate bonds of $86.8 million, municipal fixed-rate bonds of $52.1 million, asset-backed bonds of $5.5 million, mortgage/agency-backed bonds of $8.4 million, and government bonds of $14.3 million. At December 31, 2014, these investments included corporate bonds of $111.3 million, municipal fixed-rate bonds of $127.8 million, and municipal variable rate demand notes of $2.5 million. As of September 30, 2015, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, and government bonds were classified as available-for-sale and had a combined duration of 1.2 years with an average credit rating of A. Because our bond portfolio has a high quality rating and contractual maturities of a short duration, we are able to obtain prices for these bonds derived from observable market inputs, or for similar securities traded in an active market, on a daily basis.  Our long-term investments decreased 27.1% from $280.6 million at December 31, 2014 to $204.5 million at September 30, 2015. Long-term investments at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $30.0 million, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond. See  Debt  below for additional information. We have various equity investments included in long-term investments at a cost of $29.5 million and $26.4 million, and with a fair value of $32.6 million and $38.3 million, at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.  Long-term investments at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 also included $15.5 million and $16.3 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans, and $1.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of other investments carried at cost, consisting of interests in two private equity funds and an investment in a privately held telecommunications equipment manufacturer.  We review our investment portfolio for potential  other-than-temporary  declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% or more for six or more consecutive months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, other-than-temporary impairment charges were not significant.     32     Financing Activities  Dividends  In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we paid dividends totaling $14.0 million.  Debt  We have amounts outstanding under loans made pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the Bond) which totaled $30.0 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014. At September 30, 2015, the estimated fair value of the Bond was approximately $30.1 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard &amp; Poor s credit rating of AAA. Included in long-term investments are restricted funds in the amount of $30.0 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, which is a collateral deposit against the principal amount of the Bond. We have the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. The Bond matures on January 1, 2020, and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under this program. We are required to make payments in the amounts necessary to pay the interest on the amounts currently outstanding. It is our intent to make annual principal payments in addition to the interest amounts that are due. In connection with this decision, $1.2 million of the Bond has been classified as a current liability in accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2015.  Stock Repurchase Program  Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 45.0 million shares of our common stock. On July 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock (bringing the total shares authorized for repurchase to 50.0 million), which will commence upon completion of the repurchase plan announced on May 14, 2014. This new authorization will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased 3.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.69 per share. As of September 30, 2015, we have the authority to purchase an additional 5.8 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors.  Stock Option Exercises  To accommodate employee stock option exercises, we issued 0.1 million shares of treasury stock for $0.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  We do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, there have been no material changes in contractual obligations and commercial commitments from those discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 filed on February 24, 2015 with the SEC.  We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of September 30, 2015, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments.     33     FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS  The following are some of the risks that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements:                Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.                Our revenue for a particular period can be difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.                General economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our operating results.                Our exposure to the credit risks of our customers and distributors may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.                We expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable.                We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products in order to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology.                Our products may not continue to comply with evolving regulations governing their sale, which may harm our business.                Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable environmental regulations could adversely impact our results of operations.                If our products do not interoperate with our customers  networks, installations may be delayed or cancelled, which could harm our business.                The lengthy approval process required by major and other service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue.                We engage in research and development activities to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development efforts who may focus on more leading edge development.                We depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenues and net income.                Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards.                Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and key components may prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and operating results.                We compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share.                Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, shipment volumes, field service obligations and other rework costs incurred in correcting product failures. If our estimates change, the liability for warranty obligations may be increased or decreased, impacting future cost of goods sold.                Managing our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory.                The continuing growth of our international operations could expose us to additional risks, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.                We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.                Our success depends on our ability to reduce the selling prices of succeeding generations of our products.                Breaches in our information systems could cause significant damage to our business and reputation.                Our failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality, and commercial value of our products.                Software under license from third parties for use in certain of our products may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.                We may incur liabilities or become subject to litigation that would have a material effect on our business.                Consolidation and deterioration in the competitive service provider market could result in a significant decrease in our revenue.                We depend on distributors who maintain inventories of our products. If the distributors reduce their inventories of these products, our sales could be adversely affected.     34                If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with system integrators, service providers, and enterprise value added resellers, our sales may be negatively affected.                If we fail to manage our exposure to worldwide financial and securities markets successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted.                Changes in our effective tax rate or assessments arising from tax audits may have an adverse impact on our results.                We are required to periodically evaluate the value of our long-lived assets, including the value of intangibles acquired and goodwill resulting from business acquisitions. Any future impairment charges required may adversely affect our operating results.                Our success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel.                Regulatory and potential physical impacts of climate change and other natural events may affect our customers and our production operations, resulting in adverse effects on our operating results.                While we believe our internal control over financial reporting is adequate, a failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as our business expands could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.                The price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly.  The foregoing list of risks is not exclusive. For a more detailed description of the risk factors associated with our business, see Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed on February 24, 2015 with the SEC.
