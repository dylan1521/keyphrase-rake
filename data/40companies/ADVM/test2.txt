(formerly Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc.)  June 30, 2016  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  (Unaudited)     1. Organization and Basis of Presentation  Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc. (the "Company", "we" or "us") was incorporated in Delaware on July 17, 2006 as Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc. and changed its name to Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc. on May 11, 2016. The Company is headquartered in Menlo Park, California. The Company is a gene therapy company committed to discovering and developing novel medicines that can offer potentially life-changing therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from chronic or debilitating and rare diseases. Since the Company's inception, it has devoted its efforts principally to performing research and development activities, including conducting preclinical studies, early clinical trials, filing patent applications, obtaining regulatory approvals, hiring personnel, and raising capital to support these activities.  The Company has not generated any revenue from the sale of products since its inception. The Company has experienced net losses since its inception and has an accumulated deficit of $161.2 million as of June 30, 2016. The Company expects to incur losses and have negative net cash flows from operating activities as it expands its portfolio and engages in further research and development activities. The Company believes that it has sufficient funds to continue operations for at least the next 36 months.  On May 11, 2016, the acquisition closing date, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Annapurna Therapeutics SAS, a French simplified joint stock company ( Annapurna ), in accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement (the Agreement ) dated as of January 29, 2016, as amended on April 6, 2016. As a result, Annapurna is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company issued 14,087,246 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Annapurna. All outstanding options and other rights to purchase capital stock of Annapurna were converted into the Company's options for common stock. Refer to Note 3 for more details.     Upon completion of the acquisition, the Company changed its name to "Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc.". The Company's shares of common stock listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, previously trading through the close of business on Wednesday, May 11, 2016 under the ticker symbol "AAVL," commenced trading on The NASDAQ Global Market under the ticker symbol "ADVM" on Thursday, May 12, 2016.  Follow-on Offerings -In January 2015, the Company completed a public offering of 2,369,375 shares of its common stock, which included 359,918 shares the Company issued pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of their option to purchase additional shares. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $130.6 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.  In March 2015, (i) the Company received net proceeds of approximately $8.3 million, after discounts and other issuance costs, which resulted from the sale of 230,000 common shares, and (ii) the Company issued 230,000 common shares to a shareholder that exercised warrants prior to the initial public offering.  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP can be condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a fair statement of the Company's consolidated financial information. The results of operations for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other future period. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information required by U.S. GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements.  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC.        6         2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  The accounting policies followed in the preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent in all material respects with those presented in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company added significant accounting policy below as a result of Annapurna acquisition.     Valuation of Long Lived Assets and Purchased Intangible Assets  The Company evaluates the carrying value of amortizable long lived assets, whenever events, changes in business circumstances or planned use of long lived assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate. If these facts and circumstances exist, the Company assesses for recovery by comparing the carrying values of long lived assets with their future undiscounted net cash flows. If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, long lived assets are written down to their respective fair value based on discounted cash flows. Significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows. No impairment indicators were noted for the Company's long-lived assets, fixed assets, in the periods presented.  The Company also evaluates the carrying value of intangible assets (not subject to amortization) related to in process research and development ("IPR&amp;D") assets, which are considered to be indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Accordingly, amortization of the IPR&amp;D assets will not occur until the product reaches commercialization. During the period the assets are considered indefinite lived, they will be tested for impairment on an annual basis, as well as between annual tests if the Company become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the fair values of the IPR&amp;D assets are less than their carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs when regulatory approval to market the product is obtained, the associated IPR&amp;D assets would be deemed definite lived and would then be amortized based on their estimated useful lives at that point in time. If the related project is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have an impairment related to the IPR&amp;D asset, calculated as the excess of their carrying value over fair value. The Company estimated fair value of IPR&amp;D assets acquired in Annapurna transaction at the acquisition closing date, May 11, 2016. No impairment was recorded at June 30, 2016, as there were no changes in the fair value of IPR&amp;D assets between May 11 and June 30, 2016.     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No.2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 605 , Revenue Recognition . This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASUalso requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. Companies may adopt ASU 2014-09 using a full retrospective approach or report the cumulative effect as of the date of adoption. In July 2015, the FASB voted to approve a one-year deferral of the effective date to December 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date and permitted early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016 . The Company is evaluating the application of this ASU and method of adoption, but has not yet determined the potential effects it may have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , requiring management to evaluate whether events or conditions could impact an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures if necessary. Management will be required to perform the evaluation within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt and the type of disclosure will be determined based on whether management's plans will be able to alleviate the substantial doubt. The accounting standards update will be effective for the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early application permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to impact the Company's financial position or results of operations.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, Leases . ASU 2016-2 is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet determined the method of adoption and the potential effect the new standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.     7       In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.2016-9, Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . ASU 2016-9 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) the income tax consequences, (2) cl assification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and (3) classification in the consolidated statement of cash flows.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 , with early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet determined the method of adoption and the potential effect the new standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.     The Company has reviewed other recent accounting pronouncements and concluded they are either not applicable to the business or no material effect is expected on the consolidated financial statements as a result of future adoption.        3. Acquisition of Annapurna             (a)   Purchase Price Allocation     On May 11, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding equity interests of Annapurna. Annapurna is a privately held French limited liability company and has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Annapurna, Inc. in the U.S. and Annapurna Therapeutics Limited in Ireland. Annapurna is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing new gene therapy products for people living with severe diseases. The primary reasons for the acquisition were to diversify the technology platforms within the Company's research and development portfolio and to apply the Company's resources and expertise in gene vectors development to advance Annapurna programs through development and clinical trials. Annapurna's results of operations and fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.     The purchase price consideration was estimated to be $64.8 million, which was based on the Company's common stock closing price on NASDAQ on the acquisition closing date of $4.14 per share. A total of 14,087,246 shares of the Company's common stock were issued to shareholders of Annapurna in exchange for all common and preferred stock outstanding at the closing date. Annapurna stockholders did not receive any fractional shares of the Company's common stock in connection with the acquisition. Instead of receiving any fractional shares, each Annapurna stockholders were paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such fraction amount multiplied by the average 10 business days sale price of the Company's common stock on NASDAQ from the acquisition date. Annapurna Series O preferred shares issued to founders were canceled prior to the acquisition date and were not included in the purchase price consideration. Vesting of certain of Annapurna's options and unvested common stock shares was accelerated at the closing date. The fair value of awards related to accelerated vesting of options and shares of $0.9 million was excluded from the purchase price consideration and included in the Company's operating expenses post acquisition. A portion of the purchase price has been attributed to the exchange of Annapurna's options and other rights to purchase capital stock outstanding at the acquisition closing date for corresponding common stock options of the Company at an exchange ratio of 9.54655.  The Company reserved 3,673,940 shares for the future exercise of the Company's stock options. The total fair value of assumed Annapurna's stock options and stock-based awards was estimated at $14.7 million on the acquisition date, using the Black-Scholes pricing model, assuming no dividends, expected volatilities of 80% and 89%, risk-free interest rates of 1.4% and 1.1%, and expected lives of six and ten years for employees and non-employees awards, respectively. Of the total fair value, $7.4 million has been attributed as pre-combination service and included as part of the total purchase price consideration. The post-combination attribution of $7.2 million will be recognized as compensation expense over the remaining requisite service period. The Company has included $1.1 million in stock-based compensation expense related to the vesting of exchanged stock options and day-one post combination compensation expenses related to accelerated vesting of options and shares in its condensed consolidated statement of operations during the second quarter 2016.  Total purchase price consideration was as follows (in thousands):             8      The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method based on ASC 805, Business Combinations, with Adverum identified as the acquirer, based on  the existence of a controlling financial interest of the combined entities. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the May 11, 2016. Goodwill, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, is measured as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, which is also measured at fair value, and the net of the fair values of the as sets acquired and the liabilities assumed as of the acquisition closing date. Acquisition costs were expensed as incurred and recorded as general and administrative expenses. The Company recorded $0.6 million and $2.5 million of acquisition costs for the t hree-months and six-months ended June 30, 2016 , respectively .     Valuing certain components of the acquisition, primarily intangible assets acquired, deferred taxes, uncertain tax positions and accrued liabilities required us to make significant estimates that may be adjusted in the future; consequently, the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are considered preliminary. Final determination of these estimates could result in an adjustment to the preliminary purchase price allocation, with an offsetting adjustment to goodwill. Preliminary allocation of total purchase price consideration is as follows (in thousands):          The identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) assets related to products in development, as summarized in the table below (in thousands):          The fair value of each IPR&amp;D asset is estimated using the income approach and calculated using cash flow projections adjusted for inherent risks regarding regulatory approval, promotion, and distribution, discounted at a rate of approximately 11.0%. The Company acquired two additional intangible assets relating to the Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) and severe allergy programs but the fair value of each of these assets was determined to be nominal and is not included in the total acquired intangible assets. All IPR&amp;D intangible assets acquired are currently classified as indefinite-lived and are not currently being amortized. IPR&amp;D asset becomes definite-lived upon the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts, and will be amortized from that time over an estimated useful life based on respective patent terms. The fair value of each IPR&amp;D asset will continue to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more often if the Company identifies impairment indicators that would require earlier testing. Based on the preliminary fair values above, an amount of $49.1 million has been allocated to goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values assigned to the net assets acquired. The full amount of the preliminary value of goodwill has been assigned to the entire Company, since management has determined that the Company has only one reporting unit. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.  The amount of net loss of Annapurna included in the consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date, through the period ended June 30, 2016 was $1.2 million. Annapurna did not generate any revenues prior or post acquisition.     9      The following table presents the unaudited pro forma results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The pro forma financial information combines the results of operations of Adv erum and Annapurna as though the businesses had been combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2015. The pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only, and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achi eved in the current or any future periods.          Pro-forma adjustments included the following:                 Actual acquisition-related transaction costs of $0.6 million and $2.5 million for three and six months ended June 2016 were excluded from the 2016 pro forma results above. As these expenses were incurred prior to the closing of the acquisition, they were not included in the 2015 pro forma results.              Stock-based compensation expense related to accelerated vesting associated with the acquisition of $0.9 million was excluded from the 2016 pro forma results and was recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2015.              Stock-based compensation expense related to options granted to executives upon the acquisition closing of $0.1 million and $0.2 million was included in the 2016 and 2015 pro forma results above.              Interest expense related to convertible notes and changes in fair value of preferred stock warrants of $0.5 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015, $0.5 million for the three month period ended June 30, 2016, and $1.0 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2016, were excluded form 2015 and 2016 pro-forma results above, as the convertible notes and warrants were settled prior to the acquisition closing.              Bonuses paid in connection with closing of the acquisition in May 2016 of $0.4 million were excluded from the 2016 pro forma results and were recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2015.       The unaudited condensed pro forma information does not include any anticipated synergies that may be achievable subsequent to the date of acquisition.                b)   Impairment evaluation for intangible assets and goodwill     As the Company recorded goodwill and IPR&amp;D intangible assets upon the acquisition of Annapurna, the Company is required to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The Company operates as one reporting unit and goodwill was recorded to this reporting unit.     During the second quarter the Company noted a continuing decrease in its stock price that resulted in the market capitalization being less than the carrying value of the Company's net assets as of June 30, 2016. As the operating losses are expected to increase significantly in the following years due to continuing pre-clinical and expected clinical trials, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company's one reporting unit is less than its carrying value and as a result performed a step one goodwill impairment analysis.     In performing the step one analysis, the Company determined the fair value of the reporting unit using a market-based approach. The Company multiplied the stock price of $3.16 on June 30, 2016 by the 41.3 million common shares outstanding and applied a control premium to estimate the common equity value on a controlling basis. As the fair value was less than the carrying value of the Company's net assets, the Company proceeded to step two of the impairment analysis.     The second step of the analysis includes allocating the calculated fair value (determined in the step one analysis) of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities to determine an implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in an acquisition. That is, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was     10      allocated to all of the assets and liabiliti es as if the Company had been acquired and the estimated fair value was the purchase price paid. As part of this assessment the Company considered preliminary valuation of Annapurna net assets acquired, excluding goodwill, as their fair value from May 11, 2016, the acquisition closing date, to June 30, 2016 did not change . The Company also noted that the fair value of current assets and liabilities approximates their carrying value due to their short-term nature, the Company's cash and cash equivalent balan ce is higher than the fair value estimated in the step one analysis, and the fair value of fixed assets approximates their recorded value as most of the Company's fixed assets are acquired in the last couple of years. Based on this analysis, the implied fa ir value of the goodwill was zero. Accordingly, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $49.1 million in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the period ended June 30, 2016.     As the Annapurna purchase price allocation is preliminary and the amount of goodwill might change during the measurement period, the recorded impairment charge reflects the Company's best estimate as of June 30, 2016.     We did not impair recorded IPR&amp;D intangible assets, as their carrying value at June 30, 2016 approximated their fair value. We noted no significant changes in IPR&amp;D intangible assets fair values from May 11, 2016, the acquisition closing date, to June 30, 2016.        4. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  The Company did not hold any marketable securities as of June 30, 2016, all investments were held in money market funds and are treated as cash equivalents. .  The following is a summary of the cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2015:          As of December 31, 2015, the contractual maturities of the Company's marketable securities were less than one year. The Company has not sold any securities prior to their maturities and so does not consider any losses on these investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities in any of the periods presented.        5. Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:  Level 1 : Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 : Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3 : Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.  The fair value of Level 1 securities are determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 1 securities consist of highly liquid money market funds. Financial assets and liabilities are considered Level 2 when their fair values are determined using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data such as pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions, cash flow models with yield curves, and benchmark securities. In     11      addition, Level 2 financial instruments are valued using comparisons to like-kind financial instruments and models that use readily observable market data as thei r basis. U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities and certificate of deposit are valued primarily using market prices of comparable securities, bid/ask quotes, interest rate yields and prepayment spreads and are included in Level 2.  There were no transfers within the hierarchy during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no Level 3 assets or liabilities.  The following table summarizes, for assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the respective fair value and the classification by level of input within the fair value hierarchy as described above (in thousands):          Non-financial and financial assets such as intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment are evaluated for impairment and adjusted to their fair value using Level 3 inputs, only when impairment is recognized. Fair values are considered Level 3 when management makes significant assumptions in developing a discounted cash flow model based upon a number of considerations including projections of revenues, earnings and a discount rate. In addition, in evaluating the fair value of goodwill impairment, further corroboration is obtained using our market capitalization.        6. Significant Agreements  Regeneron  In May 2014, the Company entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Regeneron to discover, develop and commercialize novel gene therapy products for the treatment of ophthalmologic diseases. The collaboration covers up to eight distinct therapeutic targets (collaboration targets). The Company and Regeneron will collaborate during the initial research period of three years that can be extended by Regeneron for up to an additional five years. During the research period, Regeneron has the option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license for a collaboration target's further development by giving written notice to the Company and paying $2.0 million per target. If Regeneron exercises its option, it will be responsible for all further development and commercialization of the target. The Company is then eligible to receive contingent payments of up to $80.0 million upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones for product candidates directed toward each collaboration target, for a combined total of up to $640.0 million in potential milestone payments for product candidates directed toward all eight collaboration targets, plus a royalty in the low- to mid-single-digits on worldwide net sales of collaboration products.  For any two collaboration targets, the Company has an option to share up to 35% of the worldwide product candidate development costs and profits. If the Company exercises this option, the Company will not be eligible for milestone and royalty payments discussed above but rather the Company will share development costs and profits with Regeneron.     12      The agreement will expire with respect to each collaboration target upon the earlier of the (a)expiration of the research term if the option right has not been triggered by the end of the research term or (b)expiration of the option right if the option right has not been exercised by Regeneron. If the option right has been exercised, the agreement in connection with each collaboration target will expire upon expiration of all payment obligations by Regeneron. In addition, the agreement, or Reg eneron's rights to any target development under the agreement, may terminate early under the following situations:                 Regeneron may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time on a target by target basis or in totality upon a 30-day notice.                 Each party can terminate the agreement if another party commits a material breach or material default in performance of its obligations and such breach or default is not cured within 60 days.                 The agreement is automatically terminated upon initiation of any bankruptcy proceedings, reorganization or dissolution of either party.                 The Company can terminate the agreement upon 30-day notice if Regeneron challenges the validity, scope or enforceability of any Company patent.     University of California  In May 2010, the Company entered into a license agreement, as amended, with the Regents of the University of California (Regents) for exclusive rights in the U.S. to certain patents owned by the Regents. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid an upfront license fee of $100,000 and agreed to reimburse the Regents for patent-related expenses. The Company is obligated to pay the Regents royalties on net sales, if any, as well as an annual maintenance fee of $50,000 beginning in the calendar year after the first commercial sale of a licensed product and milestone payments related to the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory goals totaling up to $900,000 for the first indication and $500,000 for each additional indication for up to two additional indications. Through June 30, 2016, none of these goals had been achieved, and no milestones were payable.     Cornell University     In August 2014, as amended in December 2015, Annapurna entered into a master service agreement with Cornell University for assistance in regulatory affairs, overall project management and parameter development. Per the amended agreement, Annapurna will pay Cornell $13.3 million ratably over 4 years for these services, as services will be performed.     In December 2015, Annapurna Therapeutics Limited entered into three licensing agreements with Cornell University, pursuant to which Annapurna will advance its ANN-001, ANN-002 and ANN-004 programs, which were each based on gene-therapy programs initiated at the Department of Genetic Medicine at Weill Cornell.     A1AT Deficiency License Agreement : Under this agreement, Annapurna Therapeutics Limited holds an exclusive license to certain technology related to alpha-1 antitrypsin ("A1AT") deficiency and rights to an IND application to initiate clinical studies of gene therapy for A1AT.     HAE License Agreement : Under this agreement, Annapurna Therapeutics Limited holds an exclusive license to certain technology related to hereditary angioedema ("HAE") and a non-exclusive license to certain other intellectual property related to the HAE program.     Allergy License Agreement : Under this agreement, Annapurna Therapeutics Limited holds an exclusive license to certain patents related to allergens and a non-exclusive license to certain other technology related to allergens.     The Company may terminate any of these license agreements for convenience upon ninety days written notice.     Across these three license agreements, Cornell University is entitled to receive aggregate annual maintenance fees ranging from $30,000 to $300,000 per year, up to $16.0 million in aggregate milestone payments and royalties on sales in the low single-digits, subject to adjustments and minimum thresholds. In addition, under a master services agreement with Cornell University, Annapurna will utilize the university to scale production of gene therapies by manufacturing processes that the institution has already used to produce Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) material for other gene-therapy trials. The Company accrued $0.5 million as of June 30, 2016 and recorded expenses of $0.5 million (post Annapurna's acquisition) for the period from May 11, 2016 through June 30, 2016, related to Cornell agreements. No milestone payments were probable to achieve and none were recorded as of June 30, 2016.        13      Dr. Crystal, Chairman of Genetic Medicine, the Bruce Webster Professor of Internal Medicine and a Professor of Genetic Medicine and of Medicine at Weill Cornell, serve d as a consultant to Annapurna since inception and will continue to provid e services to the Company  for the annual compensation of $0.3 million. Dr. Crystal also owns common shares of the Company and he does not have significant influence on the Company's operations.      REGENXBIO     A1AT Deficiency/Allergy License Agreement : In October 2015, Annapurna Therapeutics Limited entered into an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property in order to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale certain licensed products for the treatment of  A1AT deficiency. Additionally under this agreement, the Company has an option to be granted an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property related to the treatment of severe allergies. Under this license agreement, REGENXBIO is eligible to receive annual maintenance fees, up to approximately $20.0 million in combined milestone payments and royalties in the mid-to-high single digits.     Friedreich's Ataxia License Agreement : In April 2014, Annapurna entered into an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property related to the Friedreich's Ataxia ("FA") program to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale licensed products using AAVrh10 for FA where the vector is administered by any route except directly to the central nervous system (FA Systemic).Under the terms of this license agreement, Annapurna also has an option to obtain a non-exclusive worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale licensed products using a single vector for each of FA where the vector is administered directly to the central nervous system and FA Systemic. Under this license agreement, REGENXBIO is eligible to receive annual maintenance fees, up to $13.85 million in combined milestone fees and royalties in the mid-to-high single digits.     The Company accrued $46,000 as of June 30, 2016 and recorded expenses of $20,000 (post Annapurna's acquisition) for the period May 11, 2016 through June 30, 2016, related to REGENXBIO agreements. No milestone payments were probable to achieve and none were recorded as of June 30, 2016.     Inserm Transfert     In July 2014, Annapurna entered into an agreement with Inserm Transfert whereby Annapurna holds an exclusive license to certain patents to develop, make, have made, use, import, offer for sale and sell or otherwise distribute products for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia and a non-exclusive license to certain other intellectual property related to the FA program. The Agreement was amended in October 2015 to increase the scope of the intellectual property under the licenses. Under this agreement, Inserm Transfert is entitled to receive certain de minimis license payments, certain development milestone payments of up to approximately  2 million in the aggregate and royalties on sales in the low single-digits, subject to adjustments. The Company did not have any accruals relating to Inserim as of June 30, 2016 and nor did the Company record any expenses (post Annapurna's acquisition) for the period from May 11, 2016 through June 30, 2016, related to this agreement. No milestone payments were probable to achieve and none were recorded as of June 30, 2016.        7. Property and Equipment, Net  Property and equipment, net consists of the following (in thousands):          Depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $343,000 and $147,000, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $663,000 and $265,000, respectively.           14      8. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities  Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following (in thousands):             9. Other liabilities     Due to the innovative nature of Annapurna's product candidate development programs, Annapurna has benefited from certain sources of financial assistance from Banque Publique d'Investissement ("BPI France"). BPI France provides financial assistance and support to emerging French enterprises to facilitate the development and commercialization of innovative technologies. The funds received by the Company are intended to finance its research and development efforts and the recruitment of specific personnel. The Company has received such funding in the form of conditional advances.     In August 2015, BPI France granted Annapurna a  750,000 interest free conditional advance, of which  500,000 was drawn down as of December 31, 2015. The remaining  250,000 advance was not and is not expected to be drawn down on. Payments are scheduled in equal quarterly amounts of  25,000 from September 30, 2017 to June 30, 2022. This payment schedule will be modified if the Company will receive revenue from license or product sales before advances are paid in full. The Company calculated 7% imputed interest expense on these advances that recorded it as a discount at the issuance date. The discount is amortized as an interest expense over the life of advances. As of June 30, 2016 the carrying value of the conditional advance was $373,000 and the Company recorded $15,000 interest expense from the acquisition closing date to June 30, 2016.        10. Commitments and Contingencies  Collaborations and License Agreements     In August 2014, as amended December 2015, Annapurna entered into a master service agreement with Cornell University for assistance in regulatory affairs, overall project management and parameter development. Per the amended agreement, Annapurna will pay Cornell $13.3 million ratably over 4 years for these services.     The Company is a party to various agreements, principally relating to licensed technology that requires payment of annual maintenance fees and future payments relating to milestones or royalties on future sales of specified products. Refer to Note 6 for further details. The Company expenses the annual maintenance fees on a straight-line basis and accrues the aggregate balances until invoiced or paid. Through June 30, 2016, none of the goals had been achieved under the license agreements and no cash milestones were accrued or payable. Because the achievement of these milestones is not fixed and determinable, such commitments have not been included in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.  Guarantees and Indemnifications  In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for indemnification for certain liabilities. The exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future but have not yet been made. To date, the Company has not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to its indemnification obligations. However, the Company may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations. The Company also has indemnification obligations to its directors and executive officers for specified events or occurrences, subject to some limits, while they are serving at the Company's request in such capacities. There have been no claims to date and the Company believes the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any liabilities for these agreements as of June 30, 2016.  Legal Proceedings  From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation and other legal actions. The Company estimates the range of liability related to any pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. The Company records its best estimate     15      of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, the Company records a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liab ility for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated.  In July 2015, three putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against the Company and certain of its officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, each on behalf of a purported class of persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired its publicly traded securities between July 31, 2014 and June 15, 2015. The lawsuits assert claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act) and allege that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omitted allegedly material information related to, among other things, the Phase 2a clinical trial for AVA-101 and the prospects of AVA-101. The complaints seek unspecified damages, attorneys' fees and other costs. An amended consolidated complaint was filed in February 2016, and the Company's motion to dismiss that consolidated complaint is pending.  In December 2015, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against us, our board of directors, underwriters of our January 13, 2015, follow-on public stock offering, and two of our institutional stockholders, in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Mateo. The complaint alleges that, in connection with our follow-on stock offering, the defendants violated the Securities Act in essentially the same manner alleged by the consolidated federal action: by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements and by allegedly omitting material information related to the Phase 2a clinical trial for AVA-101 and the prospects of AVA-101. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and rescissory damages, attorneys' fees and other costs. The plaintiff has dismissed the two institutional stockholder defendants, and the Company's motion to stay or to dismiss this action is pending.     The Company believes that the claims in the asserted actions are without merit and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. The Company expects to incur costs associated with defending the actions. While the Company has various insurance policies related to the risks associated with its business, including directors' and officers' liability insurance policies, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its defense of the actions, that its insurance coverage, which contains a self-insured retention, will be sufficient, or that its insurance carriers will cover all claims or litigation costs. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the Company cannot reasonably predict at this time the timing or outcomes of these matters or estimate the amount of losses, or range of losses, if any, or their effect, if any, on its condensed consolidated financial statements.        11. Stock Option Plans  The Company's 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan (2014 Plan) permits the issuance of stock options (options), restricted stock units (RSUs) and other types of awards to employees, directors, and consultants.  As of June 30, 2016, a total of 13,162,656 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance and 2,241,693 shares were available for future grants under the 2014 Plan.  In July 2014, the Company's board of directors and its stockholders approved the establishment of the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2014 ESPP). During the six months ended June 30, 2016 32,425 shares were issued under the 2014 ESPP and no shares were issued in the same period for 2015. A total of 675,383 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2014 ESPP and 623,381 were available for issuance under the 2014 ESPP as of June 30, 2016.     16      The following table summarizes option activity under our stock plans and related information:              (a)    The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the option exercise price and the closing price of common stock of $3.16 per share as of June 30, 2016.  Options granted number includes the Company's stock options for 3,673,940 common stock shares issued in exchange for Annapurna stock options at $0.21 exercise price per share. The weighted-average fair values of options granted and exchanged during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1.62 and $27.90, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $6.3 million and $10.6 million, respectively.  The Company has recorded aggregate stock-based compensation expense related to the issuance of stock option awards to employees and nonemployees in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss as follows (in thousands):          Stock-based compensation expense included additional charges of $0.3 million and $1.1 million, recorded in general and administrative expense, and zero and $1.4 million, recorded in research and development expense, related to stock modifications in connection with separation agreements three Company's executives for the three-months and six-months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.  Restricted Stock Units  Restricted stock units, or RSUs, are share awards that entitle the holder to receive freely tradable shares of our common stock upon vesting. The fair value of RSUs is based upon the closing sales price of our common stock on the grant date. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company granted a total of 1,066,283 and 97,000 RSUs, respectively. RSUs granted to employees generally vest over a two-to-four year period.  The following table summarizes the RSUs activity under our stock plans and related information:             17      The total fair value of RSUs that vested for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $2.2 million and no shares were vested for the six months ended June 30, 2015 . As of June 30, 2016, there was $5. 3 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs that we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2. 8 years.  Stock Options Granted to Employees  The fair value of each option issued to employees was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions:          As of June 30, 2016, there was $18.4 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to employees' awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years.  Stock Options Granted to Non-Employees  Stock-based compensation related to stock options granted to non-employees is measured and recognized as the stock options are earned. The Company believes that the estimated fair value of the stock options is more readily measurable than the fair value of the services rendered. The following weighted-average assumptions were used in estimating non-employees' stock-based compensation expenses:          As of June 30, 2016, there was $2.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-employees' awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years.           12. 401(k) Savings Plan  The Company established a defined-contribution savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Code (the 401(k) Plan). The 401(k) Plan covers all employees who meet defined minimum age and service requirements, and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pretax basis. For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company contributed $0.1 million and $0 to the 401(k) Plan, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company contributed $0.2 million and $0.1 million to the 401(k) Plan, respectively        13. Net Loss Per Share     Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share attributable is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share for all periods presented, since the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive.     We have excluded stock options and RSUs to purchase approximately 9.9 million and 5.2 million shares of our common stock that were outstanding as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders because their effect was antidilutive.     18            14. Subsequent Events     In August 2016, the Company entered into a collaboration, option and license agreement with Editas Medicine, Inc. (" Editas ") pursuant to which the Company and Editas will collaborate on certain studies using adeno-associated viral vectors in connection with Editas' genome editing technology and the Company will grant to Editas an exclusive option to obtain certain exclusive rights to use the Company's proprietary vectors in up to five ophthalmic indications. The Company will receive a $1.0 million non-refundable upfront payment, with a portion of such payment to be credited against Editas' obligation to fund research costs. Under the terms of the agreement, both the Company and Editas will be subject to exclusivity obligations.     Editas may exercise the option, with respect to a designated initial indication, until the first anniversary of the effective date of the agreement. With respect to the four other Indications, Editas may exercise the option until the third anniversary of the effective date, provided that the option will expire on the second anniversary of the effective date if Editas has not exercised the option with respect to the initial indication or any other indication by such date. Upon each exercise of the option, Editas will pay the Company a $1.0 million fee. If Editas elects to develop a product using certain of the Company's proprietary vectors, the Company will be eligible to receive additional payments relating to development and commercialization milestone payments for such product, and tiered royalties on net sales of such product, subject to certain adjustments.           19          
Item2.
    Management's Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operation    The interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 4, 2016. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in the section titled "Risk Factors," set forth in Part II   Other Information, Item 1A below and elsewhere in this report that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results.  Overview  We are a publicly traded gene therapy company committed to discovering and developing novel medicines that can offer potentially life-changing therapeutic benefit to patients who currently have limited or burdensome treatment options. We have leveraged our next-generation adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based directed evolution platform to generate product candidates designed to provide durable efficacy by inducing sustained expression of a therapeutic protein. We have also acquired certain other gene therapy product candidates through our previously announced transaction with Annapurna Therapeutics SAS, a privately-held French gene therapy company (Annapurna), which closed on May 11, 2016. Our core capabilities include clinical development expertise, vector optimization, process development, manufacturing, and assay development.  Prior to the Annapurna transaction, our primary focus had been the development of AVA-101 for the treatment of wet AMD. We conducted a Phase 2a trial for AVA-101 with 32 wet AMD subjects, for which we announced top-line results in June 2015. Overall, we did not observe evidence of a complete and/or durable anti-VEGF response in the majority of subjects treated with AVA-101 as administered in the Phase 2a study. We decided not to move forward with the Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 with the dose and administration procedure that we had planned to initiate in the second half of 2015. Instead, we conducted additional preclinical studies to inform further development of our wet AMD program.  After analyzing promising preclinical data evaluating different anti-VEGF compounds in non-human primate studies, we decided to discontinue development of AVA-101 and AVA-201. Instead, we will move forward with preclinical development of new, anti-VEGF gene therapy candidates focused on intravitreal delivery and utilizing a proprietary vector. The company will provide additional details on its anti-VEGF program at a scientific meeting in the fall of 2016.  In addition to our anti-VEGF program, we are working on developing product candidates targeting diseases with unmet medical need in ophthalmology, rare disease and allergy. Our most advanced program, ANN-001, is for the treatment of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AT). ANN-001 is designed to deliver A1AT protein to patients with A1AT deficiency and will be evaluated using an intraplueral and intravenous route of administration. ANN-001 has an open IND with the FDA, and we expect to initiate clinical studies in the second half of 2016. Our gene therapy program, ANN-002 to treat hereditary angioedema (HAE), is also in preclinical studies, and we expect to initiate clinical studies in 2017. We have a preclinical program targeting cardiomyopathy associated with Friedreich's ataxia for which we plan to provide a development update in 2017. In addition, we have a program targeting severe allergy which is in early preclinical development.  We also are developing other product candidates for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases, including AVA-311 for the treatment of juvenile X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) as part of our research collaboration with Regeneron and AVA-322 and AVA-323 for the treatment of color vision deficiency (CVD) commonly known as red-green color blindness.  On May 11, 2016, we completed our previously announced acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Annapurna and, as a result, Annapurna is now our wholly owned subsidiary. At the closing of the acquisition, we issued 14,087,246 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Annapurna, and the outstanding options or other rights to purchase capital stock of Annapurna were exchanged for options relating to shares of our common stock.  Upon completion of the Annapurna transaction, we changed our name to "Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc.".     20      Financial Overview  Summary  We have not generated positive cash flow or net income from operations since our inception and, at June 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $161.2 million, primarily as a result of research and development, general and administrative expenses and the goodwill impairment charge.  While we may in the future generate revenue from a variety of sources, including license fees, milestone and research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships, and potentially revenue from approved product sales, we have not yet generated any revenue from approved therapeutic product candidates.  We entered into our first license and development revenue generating agreement with Regeneron in May 2014. We entered into the collaboration, option and license agreement with Editas in August 2016, that also will be a revenue agreement. Editas agreement is disclosed in Note 14, Subsequent Events , in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q.We have no manufacturing facilities, and all of our manufacturing activities are contracted out to third parties. Additionally, we have used third-party clinical research organizations (CROs) to carry out our clinical development and we do not yet have a sales organization.  We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We will need substantial additional funding in the future to support our operating activities as we advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval and prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital, or to do so on acceptable terms, when needed, or to form additional collaboration partnerships to support our efforts, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or potential commercialization efforts.  As of June 30, 2016, we had $241.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that we have sufficient funds to continue operations for at least the next 36 months.  Revenue  To date we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our products. In May 2014, we entered into a multi-year license and development agreement with Regeneron. Under the terms of the agreement, we received initial payments of $8.0 million that included payment for research license fees, prepaid collaboration research costs and the right of first negotiation for a potential license to develop and commercialize AVA-101. As the agreement provides for multiple deliverables, we account for this agreement as a multiple elements revenue arrangement. If deliverables do not appear to have a standalone fair value, they were combined with other deliverables into a unit of accounting with standalone fair value. We allocated the $8.0 million received to the fair values of the two units of accounting identified in the arrangement. We expect to recognize $6.5 million for research licenses and related research and development services ratably over the associated period of performance, which is the maximum research period of eight years. As there is no discernible pattern of performance and/or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, we will recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the eight-year performance period. The remaining $1.5 million allocated to the second unit of accounting for the time-limited right of first negotiation for AVA-101 was deferred. On November 2, 2015, Regeneron notified the management that it was not exercising this right of first negotiation and we recognized the entire $1.5 million as revenue in 2015.  The portion of the upfront payment that was applied to the original research budget was fully used in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the Company and Regeneron, through a joint review committee, agree annually on an updated research and development services budget through the research period. The Company invoices Regeneron quarterly for services performed in each prior. These additional research fees are added to the research licenses and related research and development services unit of accounting, recorded as deferred revenue and recognized to revenue over the remaining maximum research term. The Company recognized $307,000 and $203,000 as revenue related to this unit of accounting during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $572,000 and $406,000 as revenue related to this unit of accounting during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company recorded $7.2 million of deferred revenue, including $1.2 million as current deferred revenue, and $1.0 million as a receivable from collaboration partner as of June 30, 2016.   Our ability to generate product revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the amount or timing of product revenue. Even if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of our products, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.     21      Research and Development Expenses  Conducting a significant amount of research and development is central to our business model. Research and development expenses include certain payroll and personnel expenses, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, external contract research and development expenses, including expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical study materials and overhead expenses, including rent, equipment depreciation, insurance and utilities.  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods or services for future research and development activities are deferred and expensed as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.  We estimate preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and CROs that have conducted and managed preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. We estimate the amounts incurred through communications with third party service providers and our estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date are based on information available at the time. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly.  At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or aggregate costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of a product candidate is highly uncertain, and clinical development timelines, the probability of success and development and commercialization costs can differ materially from expectations.  We received refundable tax credits from the Australian and French tax authorities in connection with certain research costs incurred by our subsidiaries conducting research in Australia and France. These refunds do not depend on our taxable income or tax position and therefore we do not account for them under an income tax accounting model. We recognize such refunds as government grants in the period when qualified expenses are incurred as a reduction of research expenses. We have recorded the reimbursement from the Australian and French tax authorities as a reduction of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the applicable period. The Company recorded tax credits of $20,000 and $65,000 for the three and six-month periods ending June 30, 2016, respectively, and $67,000 and 119,000 for the three and six-month periods ending June 30, 2015, respectively.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related costs, stock-based compensation, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development expenses. Our general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods if and to the extent we elect to increase our investment in infrastructure to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We will continue to evaluate the need for such investment in conjunction with ongoing consideration of our pipeline of product candidates. We anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal and regulatory functions, as well as director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with being a public reporting company.  Goodwill Impairment  As the Company recorded goodwill and IPR&amp;D intangible assets upon the acquisition of Annapurna, the Company is required to test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The Company operates as one reporting unit and goodwill was recorded to this reporting unit. The Company recorded goodwill impairment charge of $49.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates  Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the accompanying unaudited     22      condensed consolidated financial statements and in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report) as filed with the SEC, on March4, 2 016.  The Company added critical accounting policy below as a result of Annapurna acquisition.  Valuation of Long Lived Assets and Purchased Intangible Assets  The Company evaluates the carrying value of amortizable long lived assets, whenever events, changes in business circumstances or planned use of long lived assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate. If these facts and circumstances exist, the Company assesses for recovery by comparing the carrying values of long lived assets with their future undiscounted net cash flows. If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, long lived assets are written down to their respective fair value based on discounted cash flows. Significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows. No impairment indicators were noted for the Company's long-lived assets, fixed assets, in the periods presented.  The Company also evaluates the carrying value of intangible assets (not subject to amortization) related to in process research and development ("IPR&amp;D") assets, which are considered to be indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Accordingly, amortization of the IPR&amp;D assets will not occur until the product reaches commercialization. During the period the assets are considered indefinite lived, they will be tested for impairment on an annual basis, as well as between annual tests if the Company becomes aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the fair values of the IPR&amp;D assets are less than their carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs when regulatory approval to market the product is obtained, the associated IPR&amp;D assets would be deemed definite lived and would then be amortized based on their estimated useful lives at that point in time. If the related project is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have an impairment related to the IPR&amp;D asset, calculated as the excess of their carrying value over fair value. The Company estimated fair value of IPR&amp;D assets acquired in Annapurna transaction at the acquisition closing date, May 11, 2016. No impairment was recorded at June 30, 2016, as there were no changes in the fair value of IPR&amp;D assets between May 11 and June 30, 2016.  Results of Operations  Comparison of the Three and Six Month Periods Ended June30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands)          Revenue  Collaboration revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 increased by $0.1 million and $0.2 million over the prior year period, respectively. Recorded revenue relates to the revenue contract with Regeneron and represents license and research fees that we recognized over the research term.     23      Research and Development Expense  Research and development expense increased to $8.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $5.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, including $0.9 million relating to the accelerated vesting of Annapurna option and shares recorded after the acquisition closing, the addition of $1.2 million in incremental expenses relating to Annapurna's operations incurred since the date of acquisition and $0.3 million increase in facility and deprecation charges relating to build out of the laboratory space, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in payroll related expenses and a $0.5 million decrease in material production and clinical expenses.  Research and development expense increased to $15.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $10.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to a $4.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, including $0.9 million relating to the accelerated vesting of Annapurna options and shares recorded after the acquisition closing, the addition of $1.2 million in incremental expenses relating to Annapurna's operations incurred since date of acquisition , $0.8 million increase for outside services expense relating to toxicology, $0.6 million increase in facility and deprecation charges relating to build out of the laboratory space, partially offset by $1.7 million decrease in material production and clinical expenses and $0.5 million decrease in payroll related expenses.  For the periods presented, substantially all of our research and development expense related to Adverum development activities for AVA-101, for the treatment of wet AMD, and our other potential product candidates in our development program. Upon completion of the Annapurna acquisition in May 2016, we began incurring expenses related to Annapurna's four development programs. We expect research and development expenses may increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our pipeline products and preclinical studies relating to our gene therapies program.  General and Administrative Expense  General and administrative expense increased to $5.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $5.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to $0.6 million increase in professional service fees relating to Annapurna acquisition and $0.2 million increase in facility charges relating to office expansion, off-set by $0.3 million decrease in recruiting and travel expenses, $0.2 million decrease in marketing and investor relations and $0.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense relating to the timing of the annual employee and director equity awards in the second quarter of 2015 versus the first quarter of 2016.  General and administrative expense increased to $13.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $9.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases of $2.5 million in consulting and professional service expenses relating to Annapurna acquisition, $1.7 million in compensation and benefits, including $1.3 million in related stock-based compensation expense and $0.4 million increase in payroll-related expense, and $0.3 million in facilities allocation relating to new office space, off-set by $0.2 decrease in travel expenses.  We expect general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods if and to the extent we elect to increase our investment in infrastructure to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We will continue to assess such expenses in conjunction with ongoing consideration of our pipeline of product candidates. We anticipate increased costs in connection with increased professional fees associated with being a public company.  Goodwill Impairment Charge  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we noted a continuing decrease in our stock price that resulted in our market capitalization being less than the carrying value of our net assets as of June 30, 2016. As our operating losses are expected to increase in the following years due to continuing pre-clinical and expected clinical trials, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company's one reporting unit is less than its' carrying value and concluded to perform a goodwill impairment analysis. We performed a two-step goodwill impairment analysis and recorded a $49.1 million goodwill impairment charge in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the period ended June 30, 2016.  Other income, Net  Other income, net is comprised mainly of interest income on our cash and investment in marketable securities in 2016 and 2015.     24      Liquidity and Capital Resources and Plan of Operations  We have not generated positive cash flow or net income from operations since our inception and at June 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $161.2 million, primarily as a result of research and development and general and administration expenses and the goodwill impairment charge. As of June 30, 2016, we had $241.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and no marketable securities. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2016 will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 36 months.  We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and ongoing internal research and development programs. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or aggregate amount of such costs. However, in order to complete our planned preclinical trials and any future clinical trials, and to complete the process of obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, as well as to build the sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure that we believe will be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, we will require substantial additional funding in the future.  If and when we seek additional funding, we will do so through equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital in the future could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. In order to complete development and commercialization of any of our product candidates, we anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional capital, the requirements of which will depend on many factors, including:              the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and any clinical trials for our product candidates;              the outcome, timing of and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA and other regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;              the ability of our product candidates to progress through clinical development activities successfully;              our need to expand our research and development activities;              the rate of progress and cost of our commercialization of our products;              the cost of preparing to manufacture our products on a larger scale;              the costs of commercialization activities including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution;              the degree and rate of market acceptance of any products launched by us or future partners;              the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;              our need to implement additional infrastructure and internal systems;              our ability to hire additional personnel;              our ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing, commercialization or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements; and              the emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments.  If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or terminate some or all of our development programs and any clinical trials. We may also be required to sell or license other technologies or clinical product candidates or programs that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves.  Cash Flows          25         During the six months ended June 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $20.4 million, primarily as a result of the net loss of $77.1 million offset by the following non-cash charges: $49.1 million goodwill impairment charge, $6.9 million stock-based compensation expense and $0.6 million depreciation and amortization expense. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $17.0 million, primarily as a result of the net loss of $19.3 million offset by the following non-cash charges: $1.3 million stock-based compensation expense, $0.3 million amortization of premium on marketable securities and $0.3 million depreciation and amortization expense.

Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $81.0 million and primarily relates to the purchases marketable securities of $88.4 million and the purchases of property and equipment of $1.5 million, offset by cash received from maturities of marketable securities of $9.0 million. The purchases of property and equipment consisted primarily of acquisition of laboratory equipment to support our research and development activities.  The net cash provided by financing activities during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 of $0.3 million relates to the exercise of options for common shares. The net cash provided by financing activities during the six month period ended June 30, 2015 of $139.1 million was primarily related to $130.6 million net proceeds from our follow-on offering and $8.3 million from sale of common shares.  Contractual Obligations and Commitments     In August 2014, as amended in December 2015, Annapurna entered into a master service agreement with Cornell University for assistance in regulatory affairs, overall project management and parameter development. Per the amended agreement, Annapurna will pay Cornell $13.3 million ratably over 4 years for these services.     In August 2015, BPI France granted Annapurna a  750,000 interest free conditional advance, of which  500,000 was received as of December 31, 2015. The remaining  250,000 advance was not and is not expected to be drawn down on. Payments are scheduled in equal quarterly amounts of  25,000 from September 30, 2017 to June 30, 2022. This payment schedule will be modified if the Company will receive revenue from license or product sales before advances are paid in full. The Company calculated 7% imputed interest expense on these advances that was recorded as a discount at the issuance date and is amortized as an interest expense over the life of. As of June 30, 2016 the carrying value of the conditional advance was $373,000.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
