Page 6 of 68      Achaogen, Inc.  March 31, 2017  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  (unaudited)  1. Organization and Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  Achaogen, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiary, the "Company") is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company passionately committed to the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel antibacterial treatments against multi-drug resistant gram-negative infections. The Company is developing plazomicin, its lead product candidate, for the treatment of bacterial infections due to multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ("CRE"). The Company's Phase 3 study of plazomicin in the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract infections ("cUTI") and acute pyelonephritis ("AP"), entitled EPIC (Evaluating Plazomicin In cUTI), is expected to serve as a single pivotal study supporting a new drug application ("NDA") for plazomicin in the United States. In addition, the Company's Phase 3 study of plazomicin, the CARE (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Enterobacteriaceae) trial, which is a resistant pathogen-specific trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plazomicin in patients with infections due to CRE.  The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 2002 and commenced operations in 2004. Since commencing operations in 2004, the Company has devoted substantially all its resources to identifying and developing its product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for these operations.  Reclassifications  The change in derivative liability for the three-month period ended March 31, 2016 has been reclassified to be included in the change in warrant and derivative liabilities to conform to the current year's presentation. Such reclassifications did not impact the Company's net loss or financial position.  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") and following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP can be condensed or omitted. These financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the Company's annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a fair statement of the Company's financial information. The results of operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other future period. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2016 included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.  In May 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (the "Gates Foundation") to discover drug candidates against gram-negative pathogens intended to prevent neonatal sepsis (the "Grant Agreement"). Pursuant to the Grant Agreement, the Gates Foundation awarded the Company up to approximately $10.5 million in grant funding over a three-year research term, of which approximately $3.2 million will be advanced to the Company within 15 days after signing (the "Advance Funds"). Concurrently with the Grant Agreement, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with the Gates Foundation, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell 407,331 shares of its redeemable common stock to the Gates Foundation in a private placement at a purchase price per share equal to $24.55, for gross proceeds to the Company of $10.0 million ("Gates Investment").  In connection with the Grant Agreement and the Gates Investment, the Company entered into a strategic relationship with the Gates Foundation (the "Letter Agreement"). Under the terms of the Letter Agreement, the Gates Investment and Advanced Funds may only be used to conduct mutually agreed upon work, including the scale up of the Company's platform technology to launch a product intended to prevent neonatal sepsis (the "NSP"). Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Company agreed to make the NSP available and accessible in certain developing countries and to grant the Gates Foundation a non-exclusive license to commercialize selected drug candidates in specified developing countries, which may only be exercised in the event of certain defaults as described in the Letter Agreement (the "Global Access"). The Global Access will continue in effect until the earlier of 25 years from the closing of the Gates Investment or 7 years following the termination of all funding provided by the Gates Foundation; provided, that the Global  Page 7 of 68      Access will continue for any products or services developed with funding provided by the Gates Foundation which cont inue to be developed or available in certain developing countries.  On December 19, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of common stock made under a prospectus supplement and related prospectus pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-203282) filed on April 7, 2015 (the "Shelf Registration Statement"). This offering resulted in the sale of 7,475,000 shares, at a price to the public of $13.50 per share, including the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 975,000 shares of common stock. The Company received net proceeds from the offering of $94.6 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.  On June 3, 2016, the Company sold 7,999,996 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase 1,999,999 shares of its common stock pursuant to Securities Purchase Agreement (the &quot;Purchase Agreement&quot;) for aggregate gross proceeds of $25.4 million and aggregate net proceeds of $25.1 million, after deducting the issuance costs, in connection with a private placement financing transaction (the &quot;Private Placement&quot;). The warrants have an exercise price of $3.66 per share and are exercisable up to five years from the date of issuance.  On April 7, 2015, the Company filed the Shelf Registration Statement, declared effective by the SEC on April 21, 2015, covering the offering of up to $150.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts and/or units. The Shelf Registration Statement included a prospectus covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to $30.0 million of shares of our common stock from time to time in an &quot;at-the-market&quot; (&quot;ATM&quot;) equity offering pursuant to a sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had sold 1,105,549 shares pursuant to its ATM equity offering program at a weighted-average price of $4.82 per share for aggregate offering proceeds of $5.3 million and aggregate net proceeds of $5.1 million, after deducting the sales commissions and offering expenses.  The Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations every year since its inception. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $132.0 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $280.5 million. Management expects that, based on its current operating plans, the Company's existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2017 will be sufficient to fund its current planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. Management plans to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing arrangements, government contracts, and/or third party collaboration funding in the future to fund its operations, including the commercial launch of plazomicin. However, there can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available at terms acceptable to the Company or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional funding to meet its working capital needs, it will be forced to delay or reduce the scope of its research programs and/or limit or cease its operations.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not reflect any adjustments relating to the recoverability and reclassification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Use of Estimates  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to clinical trial accruals, fair value of liabilities, common stock and stock-based awards and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, contracts receivable, prepaid and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Short-term investments consist of available-for-sale securities and are carried at fair value. Based upon the borrowing rates (which is a Level 2 input) currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, the Company believes the carrying amount of the loan payable approximates its fair value. The warrant and derivative liabilities are recorded at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value recorded in the Company's statements of operations.  Page 8 of 68      Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash equivalents include only securities having a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits, cash, commercial paper, cash repurchase agreement investments and investments in money market funds.  Short-term Investments  Short-term investments consist of debt securities with maturities greater than three months, but less than one year from the date of acquisition, and are classified as available for sale. Short-term investments are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of net unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. The amortized cost of debt securities reflects amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts to date, which are included in interest income.  The Company reviews all of its marketable securities on a regular basis to evaluate whether any security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value.  Restricted Cash  At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had restricted cash of $377,000. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheet that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):    The restricted cash, which consists of money market accounts with one of the Company's financial institutions, serves as collateral for the letters of credit provided as security deposits under the Company's facility leases. As of March 31, 2017  and December 31, 2016, $127,000 of restricted cash is classified as current assets and relates to the current facility lease that expires on April 14, 2017.  Warrant Liability  On June 3, 2016, the Company issued warrants to purchase 1,999,999 shares of its common stock in connection with the Private Placement. Each warrant has an exercise price of $3.66 per share and is exercisable for five years from the date of issuance. The Company accounts for these warrants as a liability instrument measured at estimated fair value. The initial fair value of the warrants was determined using a calibration model that involved using the Black-Scholes Pricing Model (&quot;Black-Scholes&quot;), which requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected share price volatility, underlying price per share of the Company's common stock and remaining term of the warrants. The warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date, using Black-Scholes, with any changes in the fair value of the outstanding warrants recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  Segment Reporting  Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The Company has one operating segment.  Customer Concentration  For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's revenue was generated solely from funding pursuant to U.S. government contracts, and accordingly all contracts receivable relate to funding from U.S. government contracts.  Concentration of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a significant concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited in checking and money market accounts at one financial institution with balances that generally exceed federally insured limits. Management believes that the financial institution is financially sound, and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to this financial institution. The Company's investment policy limits investments to certain types of debt securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies and institutions with  Page 9 of 68      investment-grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the institutions holding its cash and cash equivalents or issuing the debt securities. As of March31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had not experienced any credit losses in such accounts or investments.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue when: (i) evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) fees are fixed or determinable, (iii) services have been delivered, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company currently generates revenue entirely from government contracts. Government contracts are agreements that provide the Company with payments for certain types of expenditures in return for research and development activities over a contractually-defined period. Revenue from government contracts is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred and the related services are rendered, provided that the applicable conditions under the government contracts have been met. Costs of contract revenue are recorded as a component of operating expenses in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.  Funds received from third parties under contract arrangements are recorded as revenue if the Company is deemed to be the principal participant in the contract arrangements because the activities under the contracts are part of the Company's development programs. If the Company is not the principal participant, the funds from contracts are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense. Contract funds received are not refundable and are recognized when the related qualified research and development costs are incurred and when there is reasonable assurance that the funds will be received. Funds billed and received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue.  Research and Development Costs  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include certain payroll and personnel expenses; laboratory supplies; consulting costs; external contract research and development expenses; and allocated overhead, including rent, equipment depreciation and utilities, and relate to both Company-sponsored programs as well as costs incurred pursuant to collaboration agreements and government contracts.  The Company estimates preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on its behalf. In accruing service fees, the Company estimates the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, the Company will adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made to third parties under these arrangements in advance of the receipt of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered.  Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and other current assets and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . This guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes in a classified balance sheet to require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent and is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2017. The adoption had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases , which, for operating leases, requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its balance sheet. The standard also requires a lessee to recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally straight-line basis. This ASU will be effective for the Company in fiscal year 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments . This ASU clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the assessment under the amendments in this Update is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. This guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the amendments are effective. This ASU is effective beginning January 1, 2017 and the Company assessed that the effects of this ASU had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.  Page 10 of 68      In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . This ASU simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classifica tion on the statement of cash flows. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods. The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2017 and elected to account for forfeitures on an estimated basis. The adoption had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The Company has not yet finalized its preliminary assessment and conclusions on how the adoption of this ASU will affect its current policies related to revenue recognition. The Company expects to adopt the new revenue standard on January 1, 2018, and through the remainder of 2017, will continue to assess the potential impact of adopting this new standard on any current, new or significantly modified customer contracts. In subsequent quarters, the Company will finalize its selection of transition methods and complete its evaluation of additional disclosures that may be required upon adoption of the new standard.  Net Loss Per Share  Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. For purposes of this calculation, preferred stock, stock options, restricted stock units and warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive.  For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, all potentially dilutive securities outstanding have been excluded from the computations of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding because such securities have an antidilutive impact due to losses reported. Below are listed the potentially dilutive securities outstanding as of March 31, 2017 and 2016:       Warrants outstanding as of March 31, 2017 have a weighted-average exercise price of $3.78.  3. Fair Value Measurements  Financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value. The carrying amount of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, contracts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:  Level 1 : Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 : Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3 : Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Page 11 of 68      Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.  Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified as Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The Company's Level 2 valuations of marketable securities are generally derived from independent pricing services based upon quoted prices in active markets for similar securities, with prices adjusted for yield and number of days to maturity, or based on industry models using data inputs, such as interest rates and prices that can be directly observed or corroborated in active markets.  In certain cases, where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to valuation, securities are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. Level 3 liabilities that are measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis consist of a derivative liability in connection with loan payable and a warrant liability in connection with the Private Placement.  As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, financial assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis and classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy as described above were as follows (in thousands):    Page 12 of 68           All available-for-sale securities held as of March 31, 2017 had maturities less than one year from the date of acquisition. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities in any of the periods presented. The carrying value of debt securities that were in unrealized loss positions totaled $63.9 million as of March 31, 2017. The Company has determined that (i) it does not have the intent to sell any of these investments, and (ii) it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell any of these investments before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. The Company anticipates that it will recover the entire amortized cost basis of such debt securities and has determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.  Pursuant to the loan and security agreement with Solar Capital Ltd. (see Note 7), the Company entered into a Success Fee Agreement under which the Company agreed to pay $1.0 million in cash (the &quot;Success Fee&quot;) if the Company obtains approval to market plazomicin from the Food and Drug Administration (the &quot;FDA&quot;). If such approval is obtained, the Success Fee shall be due the later of (i) August 5, 2019 or (ii) the date such FDA approval is obtained. The fair value of the Success Fee, approximately $602,000 at December 31, 2016, is recorded as a derivative liability and included in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair value of the derivative liability as of March 31, 2017 increased by $20,000 to $622,000 from December 31, 2016, as a result of the time value of money, which is presented as change in warrant and derivative liabilities in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.  The fair value of the derivative liability was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, and is classified as a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy since the Company's valuation utilized significant unobservable inputs. Specifically, the key assumptions included in the calculation of the estimated fair value of the derivative instrument include: i) the Company's estimates of both the probability and timing of a potential $1.0 million payment to Solar Capital Ltd. upon FDA approval to market plazomicin, and ii) a discount rate of 13% which was derived from the Company's estimated cost of debt. The estimated fair value of the derivative liability is most sensitive to the probability of FDA approval. Should the probability of FDA approval change by 5%, the fair value of the derivative liability as of March 31, 2017 would change by approximately $37,000. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, there was no change to the key assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated fair value. Any changes in the estimated fair values are presented as changes in warrant and derivative liabilities in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations.  Page 13 of 68      Pursuant to the Private Placement (see Note 2), the Company issued warrants to purchase 1,999,999 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.66. The Company classified these warrants as a liability measured at fair value using Black-Scholes. Under certain entity conditions, the holder of a warrant may require the Company to settle the warrant in cash at its estimated fair value using Black-Scholes. On the closing date of the Private Placem ent, June 3, 2016, the $2.6 million initial estimated fair value of the warrants was recorded as a warrant liability on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. At March31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the estimated fair values of the warrant s were approximately $27.3 million and $13.9 million, respectively. The change in the estimated fair value is primarily due to the increase in the Company's stock price and is included in changes in warrant and derivative liabilities in the Company's conde nsed consolidated statements of operations.  In February 2017, certain holders of these warrants exercised warrants to purchase 78,585 shares of common stock. The Company received $0.3 million in proceeds from these warrant exercises. The Company is required to record the exercised warrants at its estimated fair value at the time of exercise, with any change included in changes in warrant and derivative liabilities in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company estimated the fair value of these exercised warrants at their respective exercise dates to be $1.5 million, an increase of $1.4 million from its initial valuation, at June 3, 2016, of $0.1 million, primarily due to an increase in the Company's stock price.   The fair value of the warrant liability is classified as a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy since the Company's valuation utilized significant unobservable inputs, including the risk-free interest rate, expected share price volatility, underlying price per share of the Company's common stock and remaining term of the warrants. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the estimated fair values of the warrants were determined using Black-Scholes with the following assumptions:    The expected volatility is based on the Company's expected volatility. The expected term is based on the remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is obtained from the yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities for a period equal to the expected term of the warrants. The dividend yield is zero because the Company has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash dividends. Should the share price change by 5%, the fair value of the warrant liability as of March 31, 2017 would change by approximately $1.5 million.  Changes in the fair value of recurring measurements included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are presented as changes in warrant and derivative liabilities in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations and were as follows for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 (in thousands):       4. Balance Sheet Components  Prepaids and other current assets  Prepaids and other current assets consisted of the following (in thousands):    Page 14 of 68      Property and Equipment, net  Property and equipment, net consisted of the following (in thousands):    Depreciation and amortization expense for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $113,000 and $121,000, respectively.  Accrued Liabilities  Accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):       5. License and Collaboration Agreements  Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.   In April 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with its collaboration partner, Microgenics Corporation ("Thermo Fisher"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., to develop and commercialize an assay to support plazomicin. If approved, the Company and Thermo Fisher plan to have a commercial assay for plazomicin available at launch to enable health care professionals to make decisions on safe and efficacious doses of plazomicin. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, the Company is required to make milestone payments with respect to research, development, regulatory and commercialization milestones (if any). All such milestone payments may total, in aggregate, up to but no more than $6,453,000. In further consideration of this agreement, in the event of a successful commercialization of the assay, the Company is required to pay a minimum threshold annual revenue to Thermo Fisher.  As of March 31, 2017, the Company has incurred $1,433,000 in milestone payments and the cost was fully recorded as research and development expense. The Company recorded $915,000 and zero of research and development expense during the three-month periods ending March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, under this agreement. In February 2017, the Company announced the achievement of a strategic milestone in its ongoing collaboration to develop an assay enabling therapeutic drug management of plazomicin.  Crystal Biosciences, Inc.  In May 2016, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Crystal Biosciences, Inc. ("Crystal"). Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, the Company and Crystal agreed to collaborate on the discovery of monoclonal antibodies against multiple targets. Crystal agreed to conduct the initial discovery work with its antibody platform and the Company has the right to develop and commercialize the antibodies discovered through this collaboration. The Company is required to provide signing and milestone payments with respect to research, development, regulatory and commercialization milestones (if any). All such milestone payments may total, in aggregate, up to but no more than $20,550,000. The upfront signing fee, technology access fees and research funding were recorded as research and development expense. This collaboration and license agreement also provides that the Company shall pay royalties equal to a low single-digit percentage of annual worldwide net sales of the commercialized product.  Ionis Pharmaceuticals  In January 2006, the Company entered into a license agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Ionis"). Ionis granted the Company an exclusive, worldwide license with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses related to the research and development of  Page 15 of 68      aminoglycoside products. As an up-front fee, the Company issued 97,402 share s of Series A convertible preferred stock at a fair value of $15.40 per share. This license fee of $1,500,000 was recorded as research and development expense in 2006. In further consideration of this license, and in accordance with the terms of the agreem ent, the Company is required to make milestone payments with respect to development, regulatory and commercialization milestones, and to pay a percentage of revenue received from sublicensees (if any). All such milestone and sublicense revenue payments may total, in the aggregate, up to but no more than $19,500,000 for the first product and $9,750,000 following the second product commercialized under the agreement with Ionis. The Company is also required to pay additional milestone payments of up to $20,000 ,000 in the aggregate upon the first achievement of specified threshold levels of annual net sales of all aminoglycoside products in a calendar year. The license agreement also provides that the Company shall pay royalties equal to a low single-digit perce ntage of annual worldwide net sales of all licensed products, including, if applicable, plazomicin.  Through March 31, 2017, the Company had compensated Ionis $7,000,000 in connection with the first three milestones under the license for the first aminoglycoside product candidate. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had no outstanding payments due under the agreement.  6. Government Contracts  Certain of the Company's drug discovery and development activities are performed under contracts with U.S. government agencies. Management has determined that the Company is the principal participant in the following contract arrangements, and, accordingly, the Company records amounts earned under the arrangements as revenue. Costs incurred under revenue contracts are recorded as operating expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.  Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority  In August 2010, the Company was awarded a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ("BARDA") for the development, manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical evaluation of, and regulatory filings for, plazomicin as a countermeasure for disease caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens and biothreats. The original contract included committed funding of $27,600,000 for the first two years of the contract and subsequent options exercisable by BARDA to provide additional funding. In September 2012, BARDA exercised an additional $15,798,000 contract option (&quot;Option 1&quot;), which increased the total contract committed funding to $43,398,000 through March 2014. In April 2013, the Company was awarded an additional $60,410,000 under the contract to support its Phase 3 clinical trial of plazomicin (&quot;Option 2&quot;) to increase the total committed funding under this contract to $103,808,000. On May 26, 2016, the Company was awarded an additional $20 million (&quot;Option 3&quot;) under the contract to support its Phase 3 EPIC trial of plazomicin. This brings the total committed funding under the contract to $123,808,000. The Company recorded contract revenue of $7,114,000 and $5,270,000 under this agreement during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  In July 2015, the Company was awarded a contract by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (&quot;NIAID&quot;) for $1.5 million committed through June 30, 2016, with total funding of up to $4.5 million available if all options are exercised under the contract. In January 2016, an additional committed funding of $0.5 million was added to the awarded funding and the total potential funding was increased to $5.0 million. In April 2016, NIAID modified the contract to exercise an option which increased the total contract committed funding to $4.4 million through February 2018, with total potential funding remaining at $5.0 million if the remaining option is exercised.  In July 2014, the Company was awarded a one-year, $407,000 grant by NIAID to conduct discovery research on novel antibiotics targeting gram-negative bacteria. In July 2015, NIAID extended the grant term through July 31, 2016. The Company recorded contract revenue of $349,000 and $579,000 under these agreements during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  7. Borrowings  Solar Capital Ltd. Loan Agreement  On August 5, 2015, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the "Loan Agreement") with Solar Capital Ltd. (the "Lender") pursuant to which the Lender agreed to make available to the Company term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million with a maturity date of August 5, 2019. An initial $15.0 million term loan was funded at closing on August 5, 2015, and a second $10.0 million term loan was funded on June 20, 2016. Borrowings under the term loans bear interest per annum at 6.99% plus the greater of 1% or the one-month LIBOR. The Company is currently required to make interest-only payments on the term loans through August 2017, and beginning on September 1, 2017 the Company is required to make monthly payments of interest plus equal monthly payments of principal over a term of 24 months. The Loan Agreement requires collateral by a security interest in  Page 16 of 68      all of the Company's assets except intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge) and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, and also includes standard events of default, including payment defaults. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 4% may be applie d to the outstanding loan balances, and the Lender may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. There were no financial covenants attached to the loan. The Loan Agreemen t included a closing fee of$250,000which was paid at closing, and the Company is obligated to pay a fee equal to 8% of the term loans funded upon the earliest to occur of the maturity date, the acceleration of the term loans or the voluntary prepayment o f the term loans. The cost of these fees is being amortized as interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective-interest method. The Company may voluntarily prepay all, but not less than all, of the outstanding term loans. The Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. In addition, the Loan Agreement contains customary events of default that entitle the Lender to cause the Company's indebtedness under the Loan Agreement to become immediately due and payable.  On August 5, 2015, pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Company entered into a Success Fee Agreement with the Lender under which the Company agreed to pay the Lender $1.0 million if the Company obtains FDA approval to market plazomicin. If such approval is obtained, the Success Fee shall be due the later of (i) August 5, 2019 or (ii) the date such FDA approval is obtained. The fair value of the Success Fee at the date of issuance of approximately $356,000 was recorded as a debt discount and is being amortized as interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective-interest method.  Future principal debt payments on the currently outstanding term loan are payable as follows (in thousands):       The obligation includes a final fee of $2,000,000, representing 8% of the term loan currently funded, which accretes over the life of the loan as interest expense. The Company recorded interest expense related to the loan of $0.7 million and $0.4 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  8. Stockholders' Equity  On April 7, 2015, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement (the "Sales Agreement") with Cowen and Company, LLC ("Cowen"), pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell shares of its common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $30.0 million from time to time through an ATM equity program under which Cowen acts as sales agent.  As of March 31, 2017, the Company had sold 1,105,549 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement, at a weighted-average price of approximately $4.82 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $5.3 million and net proceeds of $5.1 million after deducting the sales commissions and offering expenses. As of March 31, 2017, $24.7 million of common stock remained available to be sold under the Sales Agreement, subject to certain conditions specified therein.  On June 3, 2016, the Company sold 7,999,996 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase 1,999,999 shares of its common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of $25.4 million in the Private Placement. The warrants have an exercise price of $3.66 and are exercisable up to five years from the date of issuance. The Company's Chief Operating Officer, a related party, participated in the Private Placement by purchasing 141,453 shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase 35,363 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $0.5 million. Issuance costs of $0.3 million were offset against equity as a reduction from gross proceeds.  At the close of the Private Placement, the estimated fair values of the common stock and warrants issued were $22.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively. At March 31, 2017, using Black-Scholes, the Company estimated the fair value of the remaining warrants outstanding to be $27.3 million and recorded a charge of $11.3 million and $13.4 million, for the increase in the liability, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and three-month period ended March 31, 2017 , respectively.  Page 17 of 68      Equity Incentive Plans  2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan  In February 2014, the Company's stockholders approved the 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the &quot;2014 Plan&quot;), which became effective as of March 11, 2014. Under the 2014 Plan, the Company may grant incentive stock options (&quot;ISOs&quot;), nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;) and other stock-based awards for the purchase of that number of shares of common stock. Effective, January 1, 2017, the compensation committee of the board of directors approved an evergreen increase of 1,425,522 shares that may be granted in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Plan. As of March 31, 2017, 909,040 shares were available for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.  Under the 2014 Plan, the terms of stock award agreements, including vesting requirements, are determined by the board of directors, subject to the provisions of the 2014 Plan. Options granted by the Company typically vest over a four year period and the exercise price may not be less than fair market value on the date of grant. Certain of the options are subject to acceleration of vesting in the event of certain change of control transactions. Options granted under the 2014 Plan expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.  2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan  In December 2014, the Company adopted a 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan (the &quot;Inducement Plan&quot;). The Inducement Plan is designed to comply with the inducement exemption contained in Nasdaq's Rule 5635(c)(4), which provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options, RSUs, restricted stock awards, performance awards, dividend equivalents, deferred stock awards, deferred stock units, stock payment and stock appreciation rights to a person not previously an employee or director of the Company, or following a bona fide period of non-employment, as an inducement material to the individual's entering into employment with the Company. As of March 31, 2017, a total of 1,600,000 shares of common stock have been authorized under the Inducement Plan, including the additional 450,000 shares that became available resulting from an amendment adopted by the board of directors as of February 22, 2017. As of March 31, 2017, 356,588 shares were available for future issuance under the Inducement Plan.  2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In February 2014, the Company's stockholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), which became effective as of March 11, 2014. Effective, January 1, 2017, the compensation committee of the board of directors approved an evergreen increase of 178,190 shares that may be granted in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. As of March 31, 2017, 225,261 shares of common stock have been issued to employees participating in the ESPP, and 461,406 shares are available for issuance under the ESPP.  Amended and Restated 2003 Stock Plan  The Company's Amended and Restated 2003 Stock Plan (the &quot;2003 Plan&quot;), provided for the granting of incentive and non-statutory stock options to employees, directors and consultants at the discretion of the board of directors. The Company granted options under its 2003 Plan until January 2014 and it was terminated as to future awards in March 2014, although it continues to govern the terms of options that remain outstanding under the 2003 Plan.  Options granted under the 2003 Plan expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant. Options granted under the 2003 Plan vest over periods determined by the board of directors, generally over four years.  The 2003 Plan allows for early exercise of certain options prior to vesting. Upon termination of employment, the unvested shares are subject to repurchase at the original exercise price. Stock options granted or modified after March 21, 2002, that are subsequently exercised for cash prior to vesting, are not deemed to be issued until those shares vest. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 there were no shares subject to repurchase relating to the early exercise of options.  In connection with the board of directors' and stockholders' approval of the 2014 Plan, all remaining shares available for future awards under the 2003 Plan were transferred to the 2014 Plan, and the 2003 Plan was terminated as to future awards. As of March 31, 2017, a total of 862,720 shares of common stock are subject to options outstanding under the 2003 plan, which shares will become available under the 2014 Plan to the extent the options are forfeited or lapse unexercised.  Page 18 of 68      The following table summarizes sto ck option activity under the stock plans, excluding the ESPP, and related information:       Stock-based compensation expense recognized for stock options granted to employees and non-employee directors in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations was as follows (in thousands):    Stock based compensation expense for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 includes $0.7 million of expense that relate to stock options and restricted stock units held by the former Chief Medical Officer, which were modified upon his resignation in March 2017, including $0.7 million related to such modifications.  As of March 31, 2017, approximately $20,534,000 of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.37 years.  The estimated grant date fair value of employee stock options with time-based vesting terms was calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, based on the following assumptions:       Stock Options Granted to Non-Employees  During the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not grant any stock options to non-employees. The Company recorded non-employee stock-based compensation expense of approximately $219,000 and zero for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company measures the estimated fair value of the award for each period until the award is fully vested. The non-employee stock-based compensation expense, during the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 , was estimated using Black-Scholes with the following assumptions:    Page 19 of 68      Restricted Stock Units Granted to Employees  During the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, the Company granted RSUs to employees to receive 288,064 shares of common stock under the Company's stock plans with a weighted-average estimated grant-date fair value of $21.90 per share. RSUs generally vest annually over a 4-year service period and vesting is contingent on continued service. As of March 31, 2017, there were unrecognized compensation costs of $8,401,000 related to outstanding RSUs, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.33 years.  A summary of RSU activity is as follows:    Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units Granted to Employees that Contain Performance Conditions  During the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company granted options to purchase an aggregate of 142,200 and 199,750 shares of common stock, respectively, and 25,800 and 47,425 RSUs, respectively, that vest upon the achievement of market-based common stock price targets.  The fair value was estimated at the grant date using a Monte-Carlo simulation model ("Monte-Carlo"), which requires the use of a range of assumptions. The expected life assumption is not used in Monte-Carlo, but the output of the model indicates an expected term. The associated stock-based compensation expense is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the implicit service period (expected time to vest) derived from Monte-Carlo. The fair value of awards granted to employees was estimated using Monte-Carlo with the following assumptions:       9. Commitments  Commercial Manufacturing Agreement  In March 2017, the Company entered into a commercial validation and manufacturing agreement (the "Manufacturing Agreement") with Hovione Limited ("Hovione"). Under the Manufacturing Agreement, Hovione has agreed to complete the validation program to validate and scale up the Company's technology to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient for plazomicin (the "Product") and supply the Product to the Company. The Manufacturing Agreement has an initial term of seven years after the first delivery of the Product.   Subject to the successful completion of the validation program and the Company's launch of plazomicin, the Company has agreed to purchase a minimum quantity of the Product from Hovione depending on the Company's requirements and the period of time following approval by the FDA. For the first three years following approval of plazomicin by the FDA, the Company is required to purchase at least 80% of its required quantity from Hovione. Following the initial three years after FDA approval, the Company is required to purchase between 40% and 66% of its required quantity from Hovione, depending on the amounts required during any such fiscal year. Contingent upon FDA's approval of plazomicin, the Company has minimum annual purchase commitments from Hovione, beginning in 2020 through 2024.  In connection with the Manufacturing Agreement, the Company executed certain work plans to carry out the validation and commercial manufacturing of plazomicin (the "Work Plans"). The Work Plans obligate the Company to make an aggregate amount of approximately $6.2 million in nonrefundable advance payments, of which $1.5 million was for the reservation of facilities and  Page 20 of 68      resources, plus procurement of long lead raw materials, paid in full under a separate agreement execu ted in July 2015. Such advance payments are initially capitalized as prepaid and other current assets and will be recognized as research and development expenses as goods are delivered and/or services are performed. The Company assesses such prepaid and ot her current assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or may not provide future economic benefits. Further, the Work Plans include certain terms that require the Company to compensa te Hovione if it chooses to cancel the Work Plans ("Cancellation Clause"). As of March 31, 2017, $9.8 million is committed under the Cancellation Clause and the total aggregate amount of potential commitments, if all the services are rendered by Hovione, i s approximately $28.1 million. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company has recorded approximately $4.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively as prepaid and other current assets and, during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2 016, has recognized $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, as research and development expenses, related to the Work Plans.  In December 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Hovione to procure certain long lead raw materials to be used in the commercial production of plazomicin (the "Raw Material Agreement"). The Raw Material Agreement includes $1.2 million in nonrefundable advance payments. As of March, 31 2017, the Company has recorded $1.2 million of these nonrefundable advance payments as prepaid and other current assets.  Facilities Lease Obligation  The Company leased its former principal executive offices in South San Francisco under a non-cancelable lease agreement that expired on April 14, 2017. In August 2016, the Company entered into a non-cancelable agreement (the &quot;Lease&quot;) to lease approximately 47,000 square feet of office, laboratory and research and development space for the Company's new principal executive offices ("Premises") in South San Francisco. The Lease commenced in March 2017, after the substantial completion of certain improvements (&quot;Tenant Improvements&quot;) required under the Lease, set to expire in August 2027 (&quot;Lease Term&quot;), and the Company moved into the Premises in April 2017. The Lease contains expansion options and an option to extend the Lease Term for an additional 5 years. Base rent for the first year of the Lease Term is approximately $2.7 million, with an increase in annual base rent of approximately 3.5% in each subsequent year of the Lease Term. The Lease also provides for rent abatement of approximately $1.8 million for the first year of the Lease Term.   The Company is entitled to a one-time improvement allowance of $5.7 million for the Tenant Improvements (the &quot;Allowance&quot;). The Landlord disburses the Allowance for the Tenant Improvement on behalf of the Company. As of March 31, 2017, the Company has recorded approximately $5.9 million within construction-in-progress under property, plant and equipment, net and other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet related to costs incurred under the Allowance. At its election, the Company is also entitled to an additional improvements allowance of $0.9 million (&quot;Additional Allowance&quot;). In the event the Company elects to use the Additional Allowance, the base rent will be increased as calculated in the Lease. Further, the Company had a deposit of $250,000 included in long-term restricted cash as of March 31, 2017, restricted from withdrawal and held in a money market account with one of the Company's financial institutions in the form of collateral for a letter of credit held as security for the Lease.  Future minimum lease payments under the operating leases as of March 31, 2017 are as follows (in thousands):       The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease period. Rent expense was $211,000 and $146,000 for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  10. Subsequent Events  In May 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (the "Gates Foundation") to discover drug candidates against gram-negative pathogens intended to prevent neonatal sepsis (the "Grant Agreement"). Pursuant to the Grant Agreement, the Gates Foundation awarded the Company up to approximately $10.5 million in grant funding over a three-year research term, of which approximately $3.2 million will be advanced to the Company within 15 days after signing (the "Advance Funds"). The Advance Funds are replenished by the Gates Foundation each calendar year, or sooner, following the Company's submission of a progress report, including expenses incurred for the research activities. Under certain conditions, as described in the  Page 21 of 68      Grant Agreement, the Gates Foundation may terminate the Grant Agreement and the Company is obligated to return to the Gates Foundation any unused portion of the Advance Funds.  Concurrently with the Grant Agreement, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with the Gates Foundation, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell 407,331 shares of its redeemable common stock (the "Shares") to the Gates Foundation in a private placement at a purchase price per share equal to $24.55, for gross proceeds to the Company of $10.0 million ("Gates Investment").  In connection with the Grant Agreement and the Gates Investment, the Company entered into a strategic relationship with the Gates Foundation (the "Letter Agreement"). Under the terms of the Letter Agreement, the Advan ced Funds and the Gates Investment may only be used to conduct mutually agreed upon work, including the scale up of the Company's platform technology to launch a product intended to prevent neonatal sepsis (the "NSP"). If the Company defaults in its obligation to conduct certain mutually-agreed upon work or use the proceeds from the Gates Investment as described in the Letter Agreement, or otherwise triggers certain other events of default as described in the Letter Agreement ("Charitable Default"), subject to a cure period, the Gates Foundation will have the right to request that (a) the Company redeem, or facilitate the purchase by a third party of, the Shares then held by the Gates Foundation at a price per share equal to the greater of (i) the fair market value of the common stock (if the Shares are freely tradable, the closing price of the Company's common stock on the trading day prior to the redemption or purchase, as applicable), or (ii) an amount equal to $24.55 plus a compounded annual return of 5% from the date of issuance of the Shares, or (b) if the Shares then held by the Gates Foundation are not freely tradeable, the Company register the resale of the Shares held by the Gates Foundation on an effective registration statement, subject to certain conditions and qualifications.  Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Company agreed to make the NSP available and accessible in certain developing countries and to grant the Gates Foundation a non-exclusive license to commercialize selected drug candidates in specified developing countries, which may only be exercised in the event of a Charitable Default (the "Global Access"). The Global Access will continue in effect until the earlier of 25 years from the closing of the Gates Investment or 7 years following the termination of all funding provided by the Gates Foundation; provided, that the Global Access will continue for any products or services developed with funding provided by the Gates Foundation which continue to be developed or available in certain developing countries.

Item2.
   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). These statements are often identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "could," "should," "estimate," or "continue," and similar expressions or variations. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in Part II   Other Information, Item 1A. Risk Factors below and elsewhere in this report, that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent our views as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Overview  We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company passionately committed to the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel antibacterial treatments against multi-drug resistant ("MDR") gram-negative infections. We are researching and developing plazomicin, our lead product candidate, for the treatment of serious bacterial infections, including complicated urinary tract infection ("cUTI"), blood stream infections and other infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ("CRE"). In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified CRE as a "nightmare bacteria" and an immediate public health threat that requires "urgent and aggressive action" and in 2017 the World Health Organization identified CRE as a Global Priority 1 Pathogen: Critical Need for Research and Development of New Antibiotics.  On December 12, 2016, we announced positive data from our two Phase 3 clinical trials for plazomicin. The first study, a Phase 3 trial of plazomicin for the treatment of patients with cUTI and acute pyelonephritis ("AP"), entitled EPIC (Evaluating Plazomicin In cUTI), is expected to serve as a single pivotal study supporting a new drug application ("NDA") for plazomicin in the United States. The Phase 3 EPIC trial is a randomized, double blind, active controlled study in patients with cUTI and AP and allowed broad enrollment of patients with gram-negative infections. We reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") that this trial, with a 15% non-inferiority margin, comparing plazomicin to meropenem is acceptable as the single study required for potential approval. The first patient was enrolled in the Phase 3 EPIC trial in January 2016 and enrollment was closed in August 2016 with 609 patients.  In the EPIC trial, plazomicin successfully met or exceeded the objective of non-inferiority compared to meropenem for the FDA-specified primary efficacy endpoints, and achieved superiority for the primary efficacy endpoints specified by the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"). Results for the FDA pre-specified composite endpoint of clinical cure and microbiological eradication in the microbiological modified intent-to-treat ("mMITT") population at Day 5 achieved statistical non-inferiority, and Test-of-Cure (Day ~17) achieved statistical superiority. Results for EMA-specified endpoints of microbiological eradication at the test-of-cure visit achieved statistical superiority in both the mMITT and microbiologically evaluable ("ME") populations. Plazomicin was generally well tolerated with no new safety concerns identified in the EPIC trial.  The second study, our Phase 3 CARE (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Enterobacteriaceae) trial was a resistant pathogen trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plazomicin in patients with serious bacterial infections due to CRE. We closed enrollment in the CARE study in August 2016 with 69 patients, comprised of 39 patients enrolled in Cohort 1, comparing plazomicin to colistin-based therapy in patients with bloodstream infections or pneumonia due to CRE, and 30 patients in Cohort 2, a single arm cohort of plazomicin treatment in patients with serious infections due to CRE. In Cohort 1 of the CARE trial, a lower rate of mortality or serious disease-related complications was observed for plazomicin compared with colistin therapy. The safety profile of plazomicin was favorable to that of colistin in critically ill patients in the CARE trial.  We plan to submit an NDA, which will include data from both the EPIC and CARE Phase 3 clinical trials, to the FDA in the second half of 2017, with a planned commercial launch of plazomicin in the United States in 2018, if our NDA is approved. We also plan to submit a Marketing Authorization Application to the EMA for plazomicin in 2018.  In May 2017, we entered into an agreement with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (the "Gates Foundation") to discover drug candidates against gram-negative pathogens intended to prevent neonatal sepsis (the "Grant Agreement"). Pursuant to the Grant Agreement, the Gates Foundation awarded us up to approximately $10.5 million in grant funding over a three-year research term, of which approximately $3.2 million will be advanced to us within 15 days after signing (the "Advance Funds"). Concurrently with the  Page 23 of 68      Grant Agreement, we entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with the Gates Foundation, pursuant to which we agreed to sell 407,331 shares of our redeemable common stock to the Gates Foundation in a privat e placement at a purchase price per share equal to $24.55, for gross proceeds to us of $10.0 million ("Gates Investment"). In connection with the Grant Agreement and Gates Investment, we entered into a strategic relationship with the Gates Foundation (the "Letter Agreement"). Under the terms of the Letter Agreement, the Gates Investment and Advanced Funds may only be used to conduct mutually agreed upon work, including the scale up of our platform technology to launch a product intended to prevent neonatal sepsis (the "NSP") . Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, we agreed to make the NSP available and accessible in certain developing countries and to grant the Gates Foundation a non-exclusive license to commercialize selected drug candidates in specified develo ping countries, which may only be exercised in the event of certain defaults as described in the Letter Agreement (the "Global Access"). The Global Access will continue in effect until the earlier of 25 years from the closing of the Gates Investment or 7 y ears following the termination of all funding provided by the Gates Foundation; provided, that the Global Access will continue for any products or services developed with funding provided by the Gates Foundation which continue to be developed or available in certain developing countries.   In 2012, the FDA granted fast-track designation for the development and regulatory review of plazomicin to treat serious and life-threatening CRE infections. In 2014, plazomicin received Qualified Infectious Disease Product ("QIDP") designation from the FDA. The QIDP designation was created by the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act (the "GAIN Act"), which was part of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act and provides certain incentives for the development of new antibiotics, including eligibility for priority review and of the NDA extension by an additional five years of any existing market exclusivity the product may be granted upon approval. Our plazomicin program has been funded in part with a contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ("BARDA") for up to $123.8 million and as of March 31, 2017, $0.1 million remained available from the funding committed under the BARDA contract. We have global commercialization rights to plazomicin, which has patent protection in the United States extending through at least 2031.  Since commencing operations in 2004, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to identifying and developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for these functions. In addition to plazomicin, our research team is focused on discovering medicines with novel mechanisms of action for serious infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, including MDR Escherichia coli, MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae, MDR  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and MDR  Acinetobacter baumannii.   We recently announced our orally-available antibacterial candidate, C-Scape, a combination of an approved   -lactam and an approved   -lactamase inhibitor. We believe that C-Scape has the potential to rapidly address a serious unmet need for an effective oral treatment for patients with cUTI, including AP, caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. We intend to begin a Phase 1 study outside the United States in the second quarter of 2017. We intend to initiate a single pivotal Phase 3 study in patients with cUTI, including AP, who are suitable for treatment with oral antibiotics, by the first half of 2018. We also have a program to discover and develop small molecule inhibitors of LpxC (an enzyme essential for the synthesis of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria), which could be ready to file an investigational new drug application ("IND") as early as 2018. Our therapeutic antibody program is utilizing a built-for-purpose discovery platform to identify and develop monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of MDR bacterial infections. We are also pursuing small molecule research and development programs targeting other essential gram-negative enzymes. We are taking a multifaceted approach to identify new antibacterial agents through our research. In May 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Crystal Biosciences, Inc. to identify and generate therapeutic antibodies against multiple novel targets.  Since our inception, we have financed our operations with the proceeds from our initial public offering ("IPO") of our common stock, proceeds from the underwritten public offering of our common stock, proceeds from sales of our common stock through the use of our at-the-market ("ATM") equity offering program, funding under our contracts with government agencies, private placements of our equity securities and certain debt-related financing arrangements.  Our plazomicin program is funded in part with a contract from BARDA. Our other programs are currently funded primarily with company funds, although we also received a contract for $4.4 million in 2015 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ("NIAID"), with additional funding of up to $0.6 million available if all options are exercised. Historically, our preclinical programs have received funding support from organizations in addition to the NIH, such as the U.S. Department of Defense and The Wellcome Trust, a global charitable foundation. We intend to continue to seek further collaborations with government agencies, non-profit foundations, and other research and development funding organizations to support our discovery efforts and advance the product candidates in our pipeline.  On March 17, 2014, we completed our IPO of common stock. We sold 6,900,000 shares of our common stock, which included 900,000 shares issued as a result of the underwriters exercising their over-allotment option in full. We received cash proceeds of approximately $73.9 million from the IPO, net of underwriting commissions and related expenses.  On April 7, 2015, we entered into the Sales Agreement (the "Sales Agreement") with Cowen and Company, LLC ("Cowen"), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $30.0 million from time  Page 24 of 68      to time through an ATM equity offering program under which Cowen acts as sales agent. As of March 31, 2017, we had sold 1,105,549 shares under the Sales Agreement at an average price of $4.82 per share and we receiv ed aggregate cash proceeds of $5.1 million, after deducting the sales commissions and offering expenses.  On August 5, 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Solar Capital Ltd., pursuant to which Solar Capital Ltd. agreed to make available to us term loans with an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million, $15.0 million of which was provided to us on August 5, 2015 and $10.0 million of which was provided to us on June 20, 2016.  On May 26, 2016, BARDA exercised an additional option (&quot;Option 3&quot;) under its existing contract, and we were awarded an additional $20.0 million in contract funding. Option 3 also includes a no-cost extension of the period of performance for Option 1 to September 20, 2016, under the contract to support our Phase 3 EPIC trial of plazomicin. The funding from Option 3 is focused on the Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of plazomicin, the EPIC study, in cUTI. This brings the total committed funding under the contract to $123.8 million.  On June 3, 2016, we sold 7,999,996 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 1,999,999 shares of common stock pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement ("Purchase Agreement") for aggregate gross proceeds of $25.4 million and aggregate net proceeds of $25.1 million, after deducting the issuance costs, in a private placement financing transaction (the &quot;Private Placement&quot;). The warrants have an exercise price of $3.66 and are exercisable up to five years from the date of issuance.  On December 19, 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of common stock, which resulted in the sale of 7,475,000 shares, at a price of $13.50 per share to the public, including the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 975,000 shares of common stock. We received net proceeds from the offering of $94.6 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.  We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since the commencement of our operations. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and associated general and administrative costs. We expect to incur substantial losses from operations in the foreseeable future as we advance plazomicin and other product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval, and prepare for, if approved, commercialization. Management expects that, based on its current operating plans, our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, will be sufficient to fund our current planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. We will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources to fund the commercial launch of plazomicin and continued progress with our research and development efforts. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.  We have no manufacturing facilities and all of our manufacturing activities are contracted out to third parties. Additionally, we currently utilize third-party clinical research organizations ("CROs") to carry out our clinical development and we do not yet have an established sales organization. We will need substantial additional funding to support our operating activities and adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.  Financial Overview  Contract Revenue  We have derived all of our revenue to date from funding provided under U.S. government contracts in connection with the development of our product candidates. Our product candidates are still in clinical and preclinical development and may never be successfully developed or commercialized. Other than this contract revenue from government funding, we do not expect to derive any revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize such products, which we do not expect will occur before 2018, if at all, or until such time that we potentially enter into collaboration agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of such product candidates.  Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) . We have received funding for our lead product candidate, plazomicin, under a contract with BARDA, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the development, manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical evaluation of, and regulatory filings for, plazomicin as a countermeasure for disease caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens and biothreats. Our BARDA contract provides for payments to us based on direct costs incurred and allowances for overhead, plus a fee, where applicable. The total committed funding under our BARDA contract is $123.8 million, including $20.0 million for Option 3, exercised by BARDA on May 26, 2016. The exercised option relates to the support of our Phase 3 EPIC study and the preparation and submission of an NDA to the FDA.  Page 25 of 68      For the three-month periods ended March31, 2017 and 2016, tot al revenue recognized under the BARDA contract was $7.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively.Through March31, 2017, a total of $123.7 million under the BARDA contract was recorded as revenue, with $0.1 million remaining available from the funding comm itted under the contract.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). In July 2014, the Company was awarded a one-year, $0.4 million grant by NIAID to conduct discovery research on novel antibiotics targeting gram-negative bacteria. The contract was subsequently modified to extend through July 31, 2016.  In July 2015, the Company was awarded a contract by NIAID for $1.5 million committed through September 30, 2016, with total funding of up to $4.5 million available if all options are exercised under the contract. In January 2016, an additional committed funding of $0.5 million was added to the awarded funding and the total potential funding was increased to $5.0 million. In April 2016, NIAID modified the contract to exercise an option which increased the total contract committed funding to $4.4 million through February 2018, with total potential funding remaining at $5.0 million if the remaining option is exercised.  For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, total revenue recognized under the NIAID contracts was $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively.  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with research, discovery and preclinical studies of potential new drug compounds, plus product development efforts related to clinical trials and materials manufacturing processes. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include the following:              expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites, and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our preclinical activities;              employee and consultant-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and consulting fees;              third-party supplier expenses including the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial and other materials; and              facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, amortization or depreciation of leasehold improvements, equipment and laboratory supplies and other expenses.  Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.  We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses for the foreseeable future related to our research and development activities as we continue research programs and the development of our product candidates. Further, we have incurred substantial research and development costs associated with our plazomicin program as our Phase 3 EPIC and CARE trials have completed patient enrollment. We expect to continue to incur substantial research and development expenses in the future as we continue to support plazomicin development, including preparations to submit an NDA for plazomicin to the FDA.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related costs, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development. We anticipate general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in future periods, reflecting an expanding infrastructure in preparation for commercialization of plazomicin, if approved.  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates  Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Page 26 of 68      During the three-month period ended March31, 2017, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies are desc ribed under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Results of Operations  Comparison of the Three-Month Periods Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016    Contract Revenue  Contract revenue in each period related solely to funding pursuant to our government contracts. Contract revenue increased $1.7 million to $7.5 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 from $5.8 million in the comparable period in 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development services performed under our BARDA contract.  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development expenses increased $4.7 million to $18.6 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 from $13.9 million in the comparable period in 2016. This was primarily due to increases of $5.4 million in personnel and facility related costs as net headcount increased by 37 employees in our research and development organization since March 2016, including $1.1 million for stock compensation expense, of which $0.7 million of expense relate to equity awards held by our former Chief Medical Officer that were modified in connection with his resignation in March 2017, $1.2 million in external expenses related to C-Scape, mainly attributed to start-up costs for our Phase 1 study, partially offset by a decrease of $1.9 million in the external expenses related to our plazomicin program, mainly attributable to the completion of the Phase 3 studies.  We record research and development expenses by program where directly identifiable. In the table below, we have allocated indirect research and development costs based on time charged directly to programs by research and development employees. Indirect research and development costs include employee benefit expenses, employee time not charged directly to a program, laboratory supplies and expenses, and allocated facility expenses.    General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses increased $3.0 million to $6.8 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 from $3.8 million for the comparable period in 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $2.0 million in personnel and facility related costs, including $0.7 million for stock compensation expense, as net headcount increased by 19 employees, an increase of $0.8 million in costs to prepare for registration and commercialization of plazomicin and $0.2 million in consulting and professional fees.  Interest Expense  Page 27 of 68      Interest expense increased $0.3 million to $0.7 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 from $0.4 m illion for the comparable period in 2016. The increase was a result of an additional $10.0 million of borrowings under the Solar Capital loan agreement in June 2016.  Change in Warrant and Derivative Liabilities  Change in warrant and derivative liabilities increased to $15.0 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 from nil for the comparable period in 2016. The increase is primarily due to the change in the estimated fair value of the warrant liability, which increased mainly due to the change in our stock price.   Liquidity and Capital Resources    Cash Flows from Operating Activities   Net cash used in operating activities was $13.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. The primary use of cash was to fund our operations related to the research and development of our product candidates. Our net loss from operations in the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 of $33.3 million was partially offset by non-cash charges of $15.0 million for the revaluation of the warrant and derivative liabilities, $0.1 million for depreciation and amortization, $0.2 million for non-cash interest expense, $2.9 million for stock-based compensation, and a change in net operating assets and liabilities of $1.7 million. The change in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses and other assets, as a result of commitments and deferred research and development costs related to our commercial validation and manufacturing for plazomicin, partially offset by a decrease in contract receivables.  Net cash used in operating activities was $8.9 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2016. The primary use of cash was to fund our operations related to the research and development of our product candidates. Our net loss from operations in the three-month period ended March 31, 2016 of $12.2 million was partially offset by non-cash charges of $0.1 million for depreciation and amortization, $0.2 million for amortization of premium on short-term investments and $0.8 million for stock-based compensation and a change in net operating assets and liabilities of $2.1 million. The change in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by a decrease prepaid expenses and other assets, as a result of costs related to preparing for our Phase 3 EPIC trial and the timing of our payments.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities was $68.7 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. The net cash used in investing activities during the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 is primarily a result of purchases in excess of maturities of short-term investments of $67.5 million and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $1.2 million related to our move into new corporate headquarters and to facilitate our research and development activities.  Net cash provided by investing activities was $8.0 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2016. The net cash provided by investing activities during the three-month period ended March 31, 2016 is primarily a result of maturities in excess of purchases of short-term investments of $8.3 million. Other uses of cash in both periods resulted from purchases of property, plant and equipment to facilitate our increased research and development activities.  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities was $0.8 million and zero for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The net cash provided by financing activities during the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 includes $0.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of certain warrants issued from the Private Placement and $0.5 million from issuance of common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans.  Page 28 of 68      Plan of Operations and Future Funding Requirements  We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for research, development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. Specifically, we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with our clinical development of plazomicin and C-Scape and the advancement our research and development programs. Management expects that, based on its current operating plans, our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2017 will be sufficient to fund our current planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements.  We anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional financing in the future to fund our operations, including enabling us to commercially launch plazomicin. We may obtain additional financing through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, a credit facility, government contracts and/or strategic collaborations. Additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or it may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Our ability to obtain debt financing may be limited by covenants we have made under our loan and security agreement with Solar Capital Ltd. and our pledge to Solar Capital Ltd. of substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property, as collateral. The negative pledge in favor of Solar Capital Ltd. with respect to our intellectual property under the loan and security agreement could further limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies.  The amount and timing of our future financing requirements will depend on many factors, including:              the size, timing and type of the nonclinical and clinical studies that we decide to pursue in the development of our product candidates, including plazomicin;              the type, number, costs and results of the product candidate development programs which we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future;              the rate of progress and cost of clinical trials we may commence, preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities;              the costs associated with developing a plazomicin IVD assay to support therapeutic drug monitoring;              the timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, including the preparation of a NDA for plazomicin, and any supplemental applications thereto;              our ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements;              the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;              the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments;              the resources we devote to marketing, and, if approved, commercializing our product candidates;              the scope, progress, expansion, and costs of manufacturing our product candidates;              our ability to enter into additional government contracts, or other collaborative agreements, to support the development of our product candidates and development efforts; and              the costs associated with being a public company.  Contractual Obligations and Commitments  There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments as included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 14, 2017, except as noted below:              In March 2017, we executed certain work plans with Hovione Limited ("Hovione") to carry out our validation and commercial manufacturing of plazomicin (the "Work Plans"). The Work Plans include certain terms that require us to compensate Hovione if we choose to cancel the Work Plans ("Cancellation Clause"). The total aggregate amount of potential commitments under the Work Plans is approximately $28.1 million, of which $9.8 million is committed under  Page 29 of 68               the Cancellation Clause, as of March 31, 2017. See Note 9 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more i nformation.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
