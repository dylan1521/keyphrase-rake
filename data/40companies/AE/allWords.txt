AND SUBSIDIARIES UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (In thousands, except per share data) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements. 2 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In thousands) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements. 3 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (In thousands) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements 4 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 - Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, in the opinion of the Company's management, include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for the fair presentation of its financial position at March 31, 2016, its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and its cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations.The impact on the accompanying financial statements of events occurring after March 31, 2016, was evaluated through the date of issuance of these financial statements. Although the Company believes the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, it is suggested that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in the Company's latest annual report on Form 10-K. The interim statement of operations is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations and Principles of Consolidation The Company is engaged in the business of crude oil marketing, tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals and oil and gas exploration and production.Its primary area of operation is within a 1,000 mile radius of Houston, Texas.The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Adams Resources & Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the Company") after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include any Treasury bill, commercial paper, money market fund or federal funds with maturity of 90 days or less.Depending on cash availability and market conditions, investments in corporate and municipal bonds, which are classified as investments in marketable securities, may also be made from time to time.Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with major financial institutions and such deposits may exceed the amount of federally backed insurance provided.While the Company regularly monitors the financial stability of such institutions, cash and cash equivalents ultimately remain at risk subject to the financial viability of such institutions. Inventory Inventory consists of crude oil held in storage tanks and at third-party pipelines as part of the Company's crude oil marketing operations.Crude oil inventory is carried at the lower of average cost or market. 5 Prepayments The components of prepayments are as follows (in thousands): Property and Equipment Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.Interest costs incurred in connection with major capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets. When properties are retired or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization is removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings. Oil and gas exploration and development expenditures are accounted for in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting.Direct costs of acquiring developed or undeveloped leasehold acreage, including lease bonus, brokerage and other fees, are capitalized. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized until the properties are evaluated and determined to be either productive or nonproductive.Such evaluations are made on a quarterly basis.If an exploratory well is determined to be nonproductive, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense. Costs incurred to drill and complete development wells, including dry holes, are capitalized.As of March 31, 2016, the Company had no unevaluated or suspended exploratory drilling costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.The reserve base or denominator used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves.For lease and well equipment, development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves.The numerator for such calculations is actual production volumes for the period.All other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated average useful lives of three to twenty years. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever there is evidence that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.Any impairment recognized is permanent and may not be restored.Producing oil and gas properties are reviewed on a field-by-field basis. Fields with carrying values in excess of their estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are deemed impaired.For properties requiring impairment, the fair value is estimated based on an internal discounted cash flow model.Cash flows are developed based on estimated future production and prices are then discounted using a market based rate of return consistent with that used by the Company in evaluating cash flows for other assets of a similar nature. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the carrying value of non-producing oil and gas leasehold properties and may deem them impaired based on remaining lease term, area drilling activity and the Company's plans for the property.This fair value measure depends highly on management's assessment of the likelihood of continued exploration efforts in a given area.Therefore, such data inputs are categorized as unobservable" or Level 3" inputs.(See Fair Value Measurements" below).Importantly, this fair value measure only applies to the write-down of capitalized costs and will never result in an increase to reported earnings. 6 Impairment provisions are included in oil and gas segment operating losses and were as follows (in thousands): Capitalized costs for non-producing oil and gas leasehold interests currently represent approximately three percent of total oil and gas property costs and are categorized as follows (in thousands): Since the Company is generally not the operator of its oil and gas property interests, it does not maintain the underlying detail acreage data and the Company is dependent on the operator when determining which specific acreage will ultimately be drilled.However, the capitalized cost detail on a property-by-property basis is reviewed by management, and deemed impaired if development is not anticipated prior to lease expiration.Onshore leasehold periods are normally three years and may contain renewal options. Investments Investments reflect the Company's interest in operating entities where the Company holds a non-controlling interest.Investments where the Company's interest is between twenty percent and fifty percent of the ownership are accounted for under the "Equity Method".Under the equity method, the initial investment is capitalized and adjusted periodically for the Company's pro-rata share of earnings and losses.Any dividends received will reduce the equity investment balance.Investments where the Company's interest is less than twenty percent are accounted for on the "Cost Method".Under the cost method, the initial investment is capitalized, but no adjustments are made to capitalized costs for the underlying earnings of the investments.For cost method investments, dividends are recorded as income upon receipt. On January 14, 2016 the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Adams Resources Medical Management, Inc. ("ARMM") acquired a 30% member interest in Bencap LLC ("Bencap") for a $2,200,000 cash payment.Bencap provides medical insurance brokerage and medical claims auditing services to employers utilizing ERISA governed employee benefit plans.The Company accounts for this investment on the equity method of accounting.Bencap may require additional funding as it completes development of its operations.To fund such needs, on or after September 1, 2016 but before August 31, 2018, Bencap may request to borrow from ARMM an amount no greater than $1,500,000 and on or after September 1, 2017, but not before August 31, 2019, Bencap may request to borrow an amount no greater than $2,000,000.ARMM is under no obligation to make such loans.However, in the event ARMM elects not to make such loans, ARMM's interest in Bencap is forfeited.Bencap is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to make cash distribution during any period when such loans remain outstanding. 7 The Company's investments are considered long-lived assets and will be reviewed for impairment whenever there is evidence that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.These fair value measures depend highly on management's assessment of the financial status of the underlying operation.Such data inputs are "unobservable" or "Level 3" inputs. Cash Deposits and Other Assets The Company has established certain deposits to support participation in its liability insurance program and remittance of state crude oil severance taxes and other state collateral deposits.Insurance collateral deposits are invested at the discretion of the Company's insurance carrier and such investments primarily consist of intermediate term federal government bonds and bonds backed by federal agencies.This fair value measure relies on inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and is thus categorized as a Level 2" valuation in the fair value hierarchy.Components of cash deposits and other assets are as follows (in thousands): Revenue Recognition Certain commodity purchase and sale contracts utilized by the Company's marketing business qualify as derivative instruments with certain specifically identified contracts also designated as trading activity.From the time of contract origination, such trading activity contracts are marked-to-market and recorded on a net revenue basis in the accompanying financial statements. Most crude oil purchase contracts and sale contracts qualify and are designated as non-trading activities and the Company considers such contracts as normal purchases and sales activity.For normal purchases and sales, the Company's customers are invoiced monthly based upon contractually agreed upon terms with revenue recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer.Such sales are recorded gross in the financial statements because the Company takes title, has risk of loss for the products, is the primary obligor for the purchase, establishes the sale price independently with a third party and maintains credit risk associated with the sale of the product. Certain crude oil contracts may be with a single counterparty to provide for similar quantities of crude oil to be bought and sold at different locations.These contracts are entered into for a variety of reasons, including effecting the transportation of the commodity, to minimize credit exposure, and/or to meet the competitive demands of the customer.Such buy/sell arrangements are reflected on a net revenue basis in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.Reporting such crude oil contracts on a gross revenue basis would increase the Company's reported revenues as follows (in thousands): Transportation segment customers are invoiced, and the related revenue is recognized, as the service is provided. Oil and gas revenue from the Company's interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and gas passes to the purchaser. 8 Sales of Long-lived assets Gains and losses from the sale or disposal of long-lived assets that do not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation are presented in the accompanying financial statements as a component of operating earnings. Concentration of Credit Risk The Company's largest customers consist of large multinational integrated oil companies and independent refiners of crude oil.In addition, the Company transacts business with independent oil producers, major chemical concerns, crude oil trading companies and a variety of commercial energy users.Within this group of customers the Company generally derives approximately 50 percent of its revenues from three to five large crude oil refining concerns.While the Company has ongoing established relationships with certain domestic refiners of crude oil, alternative markets are readily available since the Company supplies less than one percent of U.S. domestic refiner demand.As a fungible commodity delivered to major Gulf Coast supply points, the Company's crude oil sales can be readily delivered to alternative end markets.Management believes that a loss of any of those customers where the Company currently derives more than 10 percent of its revenues would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations. Accounts receivable associated with crude oil activities comprise approximately 90 percent of the Company's total receivables and industry practice requires payment for such sales to occur within 20 days of the end of the month following a transaction.The Company's customer makeup, credit policies and the relatively short duration of receivables mitigate the uncertainty typically associated with receivables management. Letter of Credit Facility The Company maintains a Credit and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank to provide up to a $60 million stand-by letter of credit facility used to support crude oil purchases within the marketing segment.This facility is collateralized by the eligible accounts receivable within the segment and outstanding amounts were as follows (in thousands): The issued stand-by letters of credit are cancelled as the underlying purchase obligations are satisfied by cash payment when due.The letter of credit facility places certain restrictions on the Company's Gulfmark Energy, Inc. subsidiary.Such restrictions include the maintenance of a combined 1.1 to 1.0 current ratio and the maintenance of positive net earnings excluding inventory valuation changes, as defined, among other restrictions.The Company is currently in compliance with all such financial covenants. 9 Statement of Cash Flows There were no significant non-cash financing activities in any of the periods reported.Statements of cash flow disclosure items include the following (in thousands): Capitalized amounts included in property and equipment that were not included in amounts reported for cash additions in the Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable report dates were as follows (in thousands): Earnings Per Share Earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock shares outstanding during the period presented herein. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 4,217,596 for 2016 and 2015.There were no potentially dilutive securities during those periods. Share-Based Payments During the periods presented herein, the Company had neither stock-based employee compensation plans nor any other share-based payment arrangements. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates. Examples of significant estimates used in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include oil and gas reserve volumes forming the foundation for calculating depreciation, depletion and amortization and for estimating cash flows when assessing impairment triggers and when estimating values associated with oil and gas properties.Other examples include revenue accruals, the provision for bad debts, insurance related accruals, income tax permanent and timing differences, contingencies and valuation of fair value contracts. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method.Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. 10 Use of Derivative Instruments The Company's marketing segment is involved in the purchase and sale of crude oil.The Company seeks to profit by procuring the commodity as it is produced and then delivering the material to the end users or the intermediate use marketplace.As typical for the industry, such transactions are made pursuant to the terms of forward month commodity purchase and/or sale contracts.Some of these contracts meet the definition of a derivative instrument, and therefore, the Company accounts for such contracts at fair value, unless the normal purchase and sale exception is applicable.Such underlying contracts are standard for the industry and are the governing document for the Company's crude oil wholesale distribution businesses.None of the Company's derivative instruments have been designated as hedging instruments.The accounting methodology utilized by the Company for its commodity contracts is further discussed below under the caption Fair Value Measurements". The estimated fair value of forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) is reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2016 as follows (in thousands): As of March 31, 2016, four commodity purchase and sale contracts comprise the Company's derivative valuations.These contracts encompass approximately 65 barrels per day of diesel fuel during April 2016 through March 2017 plus 67,000 barrels of crude oil for the month of June 2016. Forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) are reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 as follows (in thousands): As of December 31, 2015, one commodity purchase and sale contract comprised the Company's derivative valuations.The purchase and sale contract encompasses approximately 65 barrels per day of diesel fuel in each of January, February and March 2016. 11 The Company only enters into commodity contracts with creditworthy counterparties or obtains collateral support for such activities.As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was not holding nor has it posted any collateral to support its forward month fair value derivative activity. The Company is not subject to any credit-risk related trigger events.The Company has no other financial investment arrangements that would serve to offset its derivative contracts. Forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) are reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 as follows (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.Marketable securities are recorded at fair value based on market quotations from actively traded liquid markets. Fair value contracts consist of derivative financial instruments and are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value.Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for, and the Company elects, cash flow hedge accounting.The Company had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during any current reporting periods. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and the Company uses a fair value hierarchy of three levels that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions.Currently, for all items presented herein, the Company utilizes a market approach to valuing its contracts.On a contract by contract, forward month by forward month basis, the Company obtains observable market data for valuing its contracts.The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data.The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that may be accessed at the measurement date.Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.For Level 1 valuation of marketable securities, the Company utilizes market quotations provided by its primary financial institution and for the valuation of derivative financial instruments the Company utilizes the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX") for such valuations. Level 2 (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (b) quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities but in markets that are not actively traded or in which little information is released to the public, (c) observable inputs other than quoted prices and (d) inputs derived from observable market data.Source data for Level 2 inputs include information provided by the NYMEX, published price data and indices, third party price survey data and broker provided forward price statistics. 12 Level 3 unobservable market data inputs for assets or liabilities. As of March 31, 2016, the Company's fair value assets and liabilities are summarized and categorized as follows (in thousands): As of December 31, 2015, the Company's fair value assets and liabilities are summarized and categorized as follows (in thousands): When determining fair value measurements, the Company makes credit valuation adjustments to reflect both its own nonperformance risk and its counterparty's nonperformance risk.When adjusting the fair value of derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, and guarantees are considered.Credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as credit scores to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company or its counterparties.As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of the Company's fair value contracts.As a result, applicable fair value assets and liabilities are included in their entirety in the fair value hierarchy. Recent Accounting Pronouncement In May 2014, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.The amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.The new guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016.Early adoption is not permitted.The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application.Management is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on the Company's consolidated financial statements and the transition alternatives. In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.The standard also provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements.The new guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.Management does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. 13 In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).The standard amends existing accounting standards to require the capitalization and recording on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities associated with lease terms of more than 12 months.The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.As of December 31, 2015, the Company had rental obligations under long-term non-cancellable operating leases and terminaling arrangements totaling $12,393,000 payable through 2019, with only nominal activity during 2016.Management is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on the Company's consolidated financial statements as well as the transition alternatives. With the exception of the new standards for revenue recognition and leases, as discussed, management believes the impact of recently issued standards and updates, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption. Note 3 Segment Reporting The Company is engaged in the business of crude oil marketing as well as tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals, and oil and gas exploration and production.Information concerning the Company's various business activities is summarized as follows (in thousands): - Three Month Comparison Segment operating earnings reflect revenues net of operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization and are reconciled to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as follows (in thousands): 14 Identifiable assets by industry segment are as follows (in thousands): Intersegment sales are insignificant and all sales occurred in the United States.Other identifiable assets are primarily corporate cash, corporate accounts receivable, investments and properties not identified with any specific segment of the Company's business.Accounting policies for transactions between reportable segments are consistent with applicable accounting policies as disclosed herein. Note 4 - Transactions with Affiliates The late Mr. K. S. Adams, Jr., former Chairman of the Board of the Company, and certain of his family partnerships and affiliates have participated as working interest owners with the Company's subsidiary, Adams Resources Exploration Corporation ( AREC")Mr. Adams and the affiliates participated on terms similar to those afforded other non-affiliated working interest owners.While the affiliates have generally maintained their existing property interest, they have not participated in any such transactions originating after the death of Mr. Adams in October 2013.In connection with the operation of certain oil and gas properties, the Company also charges such related parties for administrative overhead primarily as prescribed by the Council of Petroleum Accountants Society Bulletin 5. The Company also enters into certain transactions in the normal course of business with other affiliated entities including direct cost reimbursement for shared phone and administrative services.In addition, the Company leases office space from an affiliated entity based on a lease rental rate determined by an independent appraisal. The Company utilizes its affiliate, Bencap, to administer certain of its employee medical benefit programs including a detail audit of individual medical claims.See Note (1) to the accompanying financials under the caption "Investments" for further discussion.Bencap earns a fee from the Company for providing such services at a discounted amount from its standard charge to non-affiliates. Activities with affiliates were as follows (in thousands): 15 Note 5 - Commitments and Contingencies Under the Company's automobile and workers' compensation insurance policies, the Company can either receive a return of premium paid or be assessed for additional premiums up to pre-established limits. Additionally, in certain instances the risk of insured losses is shared with a group of similarly situated entities.The Company has appropriately recognized estimated expenses liabilities related to these policies for losses incurred but not reported to the Company or its insurance carrier as follows (in thousands): The Company maintains a self-insurance program for managing employee medical claims.A liability for expected claims incurred is established on a monthly basis.As claims are paid, the liability is relieved.The Company maintains third party insurance stop-loss coverage for annual individual medical claims exceeding $100,000.In addition, the Company maintains $2 million of umbrella insurance coverage for aggregate medical claims exceeding approximately $4.5 million for each of the calendar years ended 2016 and 2015.Medical accrued amounts are as follows (in thousands): ARECis named as a defendant in a number of Louisiana based suits involving alleged environmental contamination from prior drilling operations.Such suits typically allege improper disposal of oilfield wastes in earthen pits with one suit alleging subsidence contributing to the formation of a sink hole.AREC is currently included in three such suits.The suits are styled LePetit Chateau Deluxe v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation dated March 2004, Gustave J. LaBarre, Jr., et. al. v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation et. al. dated October 2012 and Henning Management, LLC v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation dated November 2013.Each suit involves multiple industry defendants with substantially larger proportional interests in the properties except, all the larger defendants have settled their claims in the LePetit Chateau Deluxe matter.The plaintiffs in each of these matters are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.While management does not believe that a material adverse effect will result from the claims, significant attorney fees will be incurred to defend these matters.As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has accrued $500,000 of future legal/or settlement costs for these matters. From time to time as incidental to its operations, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and/or disputes.Primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet, the Company is a party to motor vehicle accidents, worker compensation claims and other items of general liability as would be typical for the industry. Management of the Company is presently unaware of any claims against the Company that are either outside the scope of insurance coverage or that may exceed the level of insurance coverage and could potentially represent a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. 16 Note 6 Subsequent Event In April 2016 the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Adams Resources Medical Management, Inc. ("ARMM"), acquired an approximate 15% equity interest in VestaCare, Inc., a California corporation ("VestaCare") for a $2,500,000 cash payment.VestaCare provides an array of software as a service, ("SaaS") electronic payment technologies to medical providers, payers and patients including VestaCare's most recent product offering, VestaPay .VestaPay allows medical care providers to structure fully automated and dynamically updating electronic payment plans for their patients.As deductibles and copays have risen in recent years, medical care providers are experiencing a significant shift in revenues from the insurance company to the individual patient.The increasing level of patient obligations has led to significantly increased bad debt write-offs for providers. ARMM's equity interest in VestaCare is in the form of convertible Series B Preferred Stock that incorporates customary anti-dilution and other investor protections.The Company will account for ARMM's investment in VestaCare under the "Cost Method".VestaCare intends to direct these proceeds towards its sales and back-office support functions as it seeks to expand its service offering. Item 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations - Marketing Marketing segment revenues, operating earnings, depreciation and certain costs were as follows (in thousands): _________________________________ (1) Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year. Crude oil revenues declined in 2016 as a result of reduced purchase and sale volumes and reduced market prices for crude oil. The volume decline stemmed primarily from reduced production and reduced purchase activity in the Eagle Ford shale trend of South Texas.Operating earnings were adversely affected by the volume declines as well as a narrowing of margins in 2016.Driver commissions are reduced both in terms of the number of drivers employed as well as pay scale due to the decline in activity.Fuel costs are lower, consistent with reduced crude oil prices. 17 Supplemental volume and price information is as follows: _____________________________ (1)Reflects the volume purchased from third parties at the oil and natural gas field level and pipeline pooling points. Crude Oil Field Level Operating Earnings (Non GAAP-Measure)(1) Two significant factors affecting comparative crude oil segment operating earnings are inventory valuations and forward commodity contract (derivatives or mark-to-market) valuations.As a purchaser and shipper of crude oil, the Company holds inventory in storage tanks and third-party pipelines.Inventory sales turnover occurs approximately every three days, but the quantity held in stock at the end of a given period is reasonably consistent.As a result, during periods of increasing crude oil prices, the Company recognizes inventory liquidation gains while during periods of falling prices, the Company recognizes inventory valuation losses.Over time, these gains and losses tend to offset and have limited impact on cash flow.While crude oil prices fluctuated during the first three months of 2016 and 2015, the net impact on earnings was to yield inventory liquidation gains as shown in the table below. Crude oil marketing operating earnings are also affected by the valuations of the Company's forward month commodity contracts (derivative instruments) as of the various report dates.Such non-cash valuations are calculated and recorded at each period end based on the underlying data existing as of such date.The Company generally enters into these derivative contracts as part of a pricing strategy based on crude oil purchases at the wellhead (field level).Only those contracts qualifying as derivative instruments are accorded fair value treatment while the companion contracts to purchase crude oil at the wellhead (field level) are not accorded fair value treatment.The valuation of derivative instruments at period end requires the recognition of mark-to-market" gains and losses. The impact on crude oil segment operating earnings of inventory liquidations and derivative valuations is summarized as follows in reconciling from the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures (in thousands): ____________________________________ (1) Such designation is (a) unique to the Company, (b) not a substitute for GAAP and (c) not comparable to any similar measures developed by industry participants.The Company utilizes such data to evaluate the profitability of its operations. 18 The Company held crude oil inventory at a weighted average commodity price in barrels as follows: Field level operating earnings and field level purchase volumes (see earlier table) depict the Company's day-to-day operation of acquiring crude oil at the wellhead, transporting the material, and delivery to market at the sales point.Comparative field level operating earnings decreased during 2016 relative to the comparative 2015 period due to reduced purchase volumes and reduced unit margins.Competition has intensified for a declining level of crude oil production within the Company's areas of operation. Historically, prices received for crude oil have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue.See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. -Transportation Transportation segment revenues, earnings and depreciation are as follows (in thousands): __________________________ (1)Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year. The Company's revenue rate structure includes a component for fuel costs such that fuel cost fluctuations are largely passed through to the customer over time.To illustrate, a calculation of revenues net of fuel cost is presented below (in thousands): 19 Revenues net of fuel are reduced in 2016 because of reduced demand as evidenced by the change in miles driven, as shown above.In addition, shippers have demanded reduced rates since the present level of demand has created industry wide excess capacity.The Company has responded by selling older and excess equipment, reducing the level of personnel and working to control maintenance costs.It is believed that a change in the current market demand scenario will not occur absent a general improvement in the overall U. S. economy. -Oil and Gas Oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily a function of crude oil and natural gas prices and volumes.Comparative amounts for revenues, operating earnings and depreciation and depletion are as follows (in thousands): ________________________________ (1) Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year. Oil and gas revenues and operating earnings declined in the comparative first quarter of 2016 following reduced commodity prices and volume reductions as shown in the table below.Volumes declined consistent with reduced drilling activity.Depreciation and depletion expense is also reduced in 2016 consistent with reduced volumes and reduced net capitalized costs. Production volumes and price information is as follows: 20 - General and administrative General and administrative expenses were reduced from $3,331,000 during the first quarter of 2015 to $2,200,000 during the first quarter of 2016 due to a reduced employee termination costs. - Investments In January 2016, the Company acquired a 30% member interest in Bencap LLC (Bencap) for a $2,200,000 cash payment.Bencap provides medical insurance brokerage and medical claims auditing services to employers utilizing ERISA governed employee benefit plans.The Company accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting. Bencap's predecessor entities began operating in their current form in January 2014.Presently, Bencap's primary focus is developing a general market for its medical claims auditing services.Unlike the traditional approach to employee medical insurance, Bencap's methodology audits and pays claims based on a multiplier which takes into consideration a premium over Medicare rates and/or a premium over the "Cost-to-Charge Ratio" which facility providers must file with the Federal government.The Company has utilized this methodology over the past three years to process and pay medical claims for its employees, including all management personnel.The Company believes the Bencap approach provides self-insured employers the opportunity for substantial savings over conventional medical insurance without sacrificing the level of employee benefits.In fact, employee options are improved since the individual employee is no longer locked into a narrow list of providers. Bencap has primarily used the Company's funding to expand its back-office and sales support functions as it seeks to compete in the medical benefits marketplace.Under equity method accounting the Company has included in operating earnings its pro-rata share of Bencap's net development expenses in excess of revenues. Outlook The continuing trend is toward reduced commodity prices and slackened demand for trucking services.As a result, the present emphasis involves curtailing oil and gas property expenditures, restricting tractor-trailer equipment purchases, and emphasizing cost reduction efforts pending a rebound in the market conditions for the Company's products and services.However, the present ongoing expansion and improvement of the Company's Houston truck terminal facility will continue to conclusion.By preserving liquidity and operating as a low-cost provider, the Company will be well positioned when general economic conditions improve. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's liquidity derives from net cash provided by operating activities and is therefore dependent on the success of future operations.The most significant source of liquidity is the cash yield from net earnings factoring in the non-cash book expense items for depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairments.The Company has no debt and funds all of its projects from this stream of cash.In most periods, cash inflows equal or exceed capital spending outflows.Should cash inflow subside or turn negative, the Company will curtail its capital spending accordingly. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no bank debt or other forms of debenture obligations.Cash balances are maintained in order to meet the timing of day-to-day cash needs and such amounts and working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, were as follows (in thousands): 21 Cash provided from operating activities was as follows (in thousands): A significant item in 2016 utilizing net cash was the Company's decision to take advantage of the disparity in the current commodity price for crude oil versus the future price of crude oil as reflected on the commodity futures exchange.This situation is known as a contango market.The Company utilized approximately $2.2 million of cash to purchase and store crude for liquidation in subsequent months consistent with fluctuations in the crude oil commodity futures market. The Company relies heavily on its ability to obtain open-line trade credit from its suppliers especially with respect to its crude oil marketing operation.Because of this, the Company strives to maintain substantial cash balances and avoid debt obligations.Cash balances were reduced as of March31, 2016 relative to the prior year end as a result of increased levels of crude oil inventory as discussed above and changes in early payments as discussed below. At various times each month, the Company makes cash prepayments and/or early payments in advance of the normal due date to certain suppliers of crude oil within the marketing operations.Crude oil supply prepayments are recouped and advanced from month to month as the suppliers deliver product to the Company.In addition, in order to secure crude oil supply, the Company may also early pay" its suppliers in advance of the normal payment due date of the twentieth of the month following the month of production.Such early payments" reduce cash and accounts payable as of the balance sheet date.The Company also requires certain customers to make similar early payments or to post cash collateral with the Company in order to support their purchases from the Company.Early payments and cash collateral received from customers increases cash and reduces accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date. The Company maintains a stand-by letter of credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank to provide for the issuance of up to $60million in stand-by letters of credit for the benefit of suppliers of crude oil.Stand-by letters of credit are issued as needed and are cancelled as the underlying purchase obligations are satisfied by cash payment when due.The issuance of stand-by letters of credit enables the Company to avoid posting cash collateral when procuring crude oil supply. Early payments, collateral and letters of credit amounts were as follows (in thousands): 22 Management believes current cash balances, together with expected cash generated from future operations, and the ease of financing truck and trailer additions through leasing arrangements (should the need arise) will be sufficient to meet short-term and long-term liquidity needs. The Company utilizes cash from operations to make discretionary investments in its marketing, transportation and exploration businesses, and more recently in the area of employer oriented medical management services.The Company does not look to proceeds from property sales to fund its cash flow needs.Except for commitments totaling approximately $12.4 million associated with barge affreightment contracts, storage tank terminal arrangements and office lease space, the Company's future commitments and planned investments can be readily curtailed if operating cash flows contract. Capital project and investment spending through the first three months of 2016 and additional planned 2016 capital spending is as follows (in thousands): For the remainder of 2016, planned capital additions included completion of the Houston truck terminal upgrades and the purchase of a minority interest in VestaCare, Inc., as described in Footnote (6) to the accompanying financials. A quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share or $928,000 was paid during each of the first quarters of 2016 and 2015.The most significant item affecting future increases or decreases in liquidity is earnings from operations and such earnings are dependent on the success of future operations.See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates There have been no material changes to the Company's Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates" disclosures that have occurred since the disclosures provided in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Item 1.Financial Statements ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (In thousands, except per share data) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements. 2 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In thousands) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements. 3 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (In thousands) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements 4 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 - Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, in the opinion of the Company's management, include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for the fair presentation of its financial position at June 30, 2016, its results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and its cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations.The impact on the accompanying financial statements of events occurring after June 30, 2016, was evaluated through the date of issuance of these financial statements. Although the Company believes the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, it is suggested that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in the Company's latest annual report on Form 10-K. The interim statement of operations is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations and Principles of Consolidation The Company is engaged in the business of crude oil marketing, tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals and oil and gas exploration and production.Its primary area of operation is within a 1,000 mile radius of Houston, Texas.The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Adams Resources & Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the Company") after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include any Treasury bill, commercial paper, money market fund or federal funds with maturity of 90 days or less.Depending on cash availability and market conditions, investments in corporate and municipal bonds, which are classified as investments in marketable securities, may also be made from time to time.Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with major financial institutions and such deposits may exceed the amount of federally backed insurance provided.While the Company regularly monitors the financial stability of such institutions, cash and cash equivalents ultimately remain at risk subject to the financial viability of such institutions. Inventory Inventory consists of crude oil held in storage tanks and at third-party pipelines as part of the Company's crude oil marketing operations.Crude oil inventory is carried at the lower of average cost or market. 5 Prepayments The components of prepayments are as follows (in thousands): Property and Equipment Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.Interest costs incurred in connection with major capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets. When properties are retired or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization is removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings. Oil and gas exploration and development expenditures are accounted for in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting.Direct costs of acquiring developed or undeveloped leasehold acreage, including lease bonus, brokerage and other fees, are capitalized. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized until the properties are evaluated and determined to be either productive or nonproductive.Such evaluations are made on a quarterly basis.If an exploratory well is determined to be nonproductive, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense. Costs incurred to drill and complete development wells, including dry holes, are capitalized.As of June 30, 2016, the Company had no unevaluated or suspended exploratory drilling costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.The reserve base or denominator used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves.For lease and well equipment, development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves.The numerator for such calculations is actual production volumes for the period.All other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated average useful lives of three to twenty years. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever there is evidence that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.Any impairment recognized is permanent and may not be restored.Producing oil and gas properties are reviewed on a field-by-field basis. Fields with carrying values in excess of their estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are deemed impaired.For properties requiring impairment, the fair value is estimated based on an internal discounted cash flow model.Cash flows are developed based on estimated future production and prices are then discounted using a market based rate of return consistent with that used by the Company in evaluating cash flows for other assets of a similar nature.During the third quarter of 2016, the commodity price for crude oil has been in decline which, if it continues, may require the recording of future impairments in the carrying value of oil and gas properties. 6 On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the carrying value of non-producing oil and gas leasehold properties and may deem them impaired based on remaining lease term, area drilling activity and the Company's plans for the property.This fair value measure depends highly on management's assessment of the likelihood of continued exploration efforts in a given area.Therefore, such data inputs are categorized as unobservable" or Level 3" inputs.(See Fair Value Measurements" below).Importantly, this fair value measure only applies to the write-down of capitalized costs and will never result in an increase to reported earnings. Impairment provisions are included in oil and gas segment operating losses and were as follows (in thousands): Capitalized costs for non-producing oil and gas leasehold interests currently represent approximately three percent of total oil and gas property costs and are categorized as follows (in thousands): Since the Company is generally not the operator of its oil and gas property interests, it does not maintain the underlying detail acreage data and the Company is dependent on the operator when determining which specific acreage will ultimately be drilled.However, the capitalized cost detail on a property-by-property basis is reviewed by management, and deemed impaired if development is not anticipated prior to lease expiration.Onshore leasehold periods are normally three years and may contain renewal options. Investments Investments reflect the Company's interest in operating entities where the Company holds a non-controlling interest.Investments where the Company's interest is between twenty percent and fifty percent of the ownership are accounted for under the "Equity Method".Under the equity method, the initial investment is capitalized and adjusted periodically for the Company's pro-rata share of earnings and losses.Any dividends received will reduce the equity investment balance.Investments where the Company's interest is less than twenty percent are accounted for on the "Cost Method".Under the cost method, the initial investment is capitalized, but no adjustments are made to capitalized costs for the underlying earnings of the investments.For cost method investments, dividends are recorded as income upon receipt. 7 On January 14, 2016 the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Adams Resources Medical Management, Inc. ("ARMM") acquired a 30% member interest in Bencap LLC ("Bencap") for a $2,200,000 cash payment.Bencap provides medical insurance brokerage and medical claims auditing services to employers utilizing ERISA governed employee benefit plans.The Company accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting.Bencap may require additional funding as it completes development of its operations.To fund such needs, on or after September 1, 2016 but before August 31, 2018, Bencap may request to borrow from ARMM an amount no greater than $1,500,000 and on or after September 1, 2017, but not before August 31, 2019, Bencap may request to borrow an amount no greater than $2,000,000.ARMM is under no obligation to make such loans.However, in the event ARMM elects not to make such loans, ARMM's interest in Bencap is forfeited.Bencap is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to make cash distributions during any period when such loans remain outstanding. Bencap's predecessor entities began operating in their current form in January 2014.Presently, Bencap's primary focus is developing a general market for its medical claims auditing services.Unlike the traditional approach to employee medical insurance, Bencap's methodology audits and pays claims based on a multiplier which takes into consideration a premium over Medicare rates and/or a premium over the "Cost-to-Charge Ratio" which facility providers must file with the Federal government.The Company has utilized this methodology over the past three years to process and pay medical claims for its employees, including all management personnel.The Company believes the Bencap approach provides self-insured employers the opportunity for substantial savings over conventional medical insurance without sacrificing the level of employee benefits.In fact, employee options are improved since the individual employee is no longer locked into a narrow list of providers. In April 2016 the Company, through its ARMM subsidiary, acquired an approximate 15% equity interest (less than 3% voting interest) in VestaCare, Inc., a California corporation ("VestaCare") for a $2,500,000 cash payment.VestaCare provides an array of software as a service ("SaaS") electronic payment technologies to medical providers, payers and patients including VestaCare's most recent product offering, VestaPay .VestaPay allows medical care providers to structure fully automated and dynamically updating electronic payment plans for their patients.As deductibles and copays have risen in recent years, medical care providers are experiencing a significant shift in revenues from the insurance company to the individual patient.The increasing level of patient obligations has led to significantly increased bad debt write-offs for providers.The VestaCare product earns a contingent collection fee and handling fees as account collections improve. The Company's investments are considered long-lived assets and will be reviewed for impairment whenever there is evidence that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.These fair value measures depend highly on management's assessment of the financial status of the underlying operation.Such data inputs are "unobservable" or "Level 3" inputs.The Company's Bencap and VestaCare investments are in the early stage of product implementation.The Company monitors revenue and product acceptance trends in order to assess the current fair value of the investment.If the fair value of these investments is determined to be below their carrying value and that loss in fair value is deemed other than temporary, an investment loss will be recognized.No such losses were recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Cash Deposits and Other Assets The Company has established certain deposits to support participation in its liability insurance program and remittance of state crude oil severance taxes and other state collateral deposits.Insurance collateral deposits are invested at the discretion of the Company's insurance carrier and such investments primarily consist of intermediate term federal government bonds and bonds backed by federal agencies.This fair value measure relies on inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and is thus categorized as a Level 2" valuation in the fair value hierarchy.Components of cash deposits and other assets are as follows (in thousands): 8 Revenue Recognition Certain commodity purchase and sale contracts utilized by the Company's marketing business qualify as derivative instruments with certain specifically identified contracts also designated as trading activity.From the time of contract origination, such trading activity contracts are marked-to-market and recorded on a net revenue basis in the accompanying financial statements. Most crude oil purchase contracts and sale contracts qualify and are designated as non-trading activities and the Company considers such contracts as normal purchases and sales activity.For normal purchases and sales, the Company's customers are invoiced monthly based upon contractually agreed upon terms with revenue recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer.Such sales are recorded gross in the financial statements because the Company takes title, has risk of loss for the products, is the primary obligor for the purchase, establishes the sale price independently with a third party and maintains credit risk associated with the sale of the product. Certain crude oil contracts may be with a single counterparty to provide for similar quantities of crude oil to be bought and sold at different locations.These contracts are entered into for a variety of reasons, including effecting the transportation of the commodity, to minimize credit exposure, and/or to meet the competitive demands of the customer.Such buy/sell arrangements are reflected on a net revenue basis in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.Reporting such crude oil contracts on a gross revenue basis would increase the Company's reported revenues as follows (in thousands): Transportation segment customers are invoiced, and the related revenue is recognized, as the service is provided. Oil and gas revenue from the Company's interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and gas passes to the purchaser. Sales of Long-lived assets Gains and losses from the sale or disposal of long-lived assets that do not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation are presented in the accompanying financial statements as a component of operating earnings. 9 Concentration of Credit Risk The Company's largest customers consist of large multinational integrated oil companies and independent refiners of crude oil.In addition, the Company transacts business with independent oil producers, major chemical concerns, crude oil trading companies and a variety of commercial energy users.Within this group of customers the Company generally derives approximately 50 percent of its revenues from three to five large crude oil refining concerns.While the Company has ongoing established relationships with certain domestic refiners of crude oil, alternative markets are readily available since the Company supplies less than one percent of U.S. domestic refiner demand.As a fungible commodity delivered to major Gulf Coast supply points, the Company's crude oil sales can be readily delivered to alternative end markets.Management believes that a loss of any customers where the Company currently derives more than 10 percent of its revenues would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations. Accounts receivable associated with crude oil activities comprise approximately 90 percent of the Company's total receivables and industry practice requires payment for such sales to occur within 20 days of the end of the month following a transaction.The Company's customer makeup, credit policies and the relatively short duration of receivables mitigate the uncertainty typically associated with receivables management. Letter of Credit Facility The Company maintains a Credit and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank to provide up to a $60 million stand-by letter of credit facility used to support crude oil purchases within the marketing segment.This facility is collateralized by the eligible accounts receivable within the segment and outstanding amounts were as follows (in thousands): The issued stand-by letters of credit are cancelled as the underlying purchase obligations are satisfied by cash payment when due.The letter of credit facility places certain restrictions on the Company's Gulfmark Energy, Inc. subsidiary.Such restrictions include the maintenance of a combined 1.1 to 1.0 current ratio and the maintenance of positive net earnings excluding inventory valuation changes, as defined, among other restrictions.The Company is currently in compliance with all such financial covenants. Statement of Cash Flows There were no significant non-cash financing activities in any of the periods reported.Statements of cash flow disclosure items include the following (in thousands): 10 Capitalized amounts included in property and equipment that were not included in amounts reported for cash additions in the Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable report dates were as follows (in thousands): Earnings Per Share Earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock shares outstanding during the period presented herein. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 4,217,596 for 2016 and 2015.There were no potentially dilutive securities during those periods. Share-Based Payments During the periods presented herein, the Company had neither stock-based employee compensation plans nor any other share-based payment arrangements. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates. Examples of significant estimates used in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include oil and gas reserve volumes forming the foundation for calculating depreciation, depletion and amortization and for estimating cash flows when assessing impairment triggers and when estimating values associated with oil and gas properties.Other examples include revenue accruals, the provision for bad debts, insurance related accruals, income tax permanent and timing differences, contingencies and valuation of fair value contracts. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method.Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Use of Derivative Instruments The Company's marketing segment is involved in the purchase and sale of crude oil.The Company seeks to profit by procuring the commodity as it is produced and then delivering the material to the end users or the intermediate use marketplace.As typical for the industry, such transactions are made pursuant to the terms of forward month commodity purchase and/or sale contracts.Some of these contracts meet the definition of a derivative instrument, and therefore, the Company accounts for such contracts at fair value, unless the normal purchase and sale exception is applicable.Such underlying contracts are standard for the industry and are the governing document for the Company's crude oil wholesale distribution businesses.None of the Company's derivative instruments have been designated as hedging instruments.The accounting methodology utilized by the Company for its commodity contracts is further discussed below under the caption Fair Value Measurements". 11 The estimated fair value of forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) is reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016 as follows (in thousands): As of June 30, 2016, four commodity purchase and sale contracts comprise the Company's derivative valuations.These contracts encompass approximately 65 barrels per day of diesel fuel during July 2016 through March 2017 plus 184,000 barrels of crude oil for the month of July 2016 and 92,000 barrels of crude oil for the month of August 2016. Forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) are reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 as follows (in thousands): As of December 31, 2015, one commodity purchase and sale contract comprised the Company's derivative valuations.The purchase and sale contract encompasses approximately 65 barrels per day of diesel fuel in each of January, February and March 2016. The Company only enters into commodity contracts with creditworthy counterparties or obtains collateral support for such activities.As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was not holding nor has it posted any collateral to support its forward month fair value derivative activity. The Company is not subject to any credit-risk related trigger events.The Company has no other financial investment arrangements that would serve to offset its derivative contracts. 12 Forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) are reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the six months and three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 as follows (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.Marketable securities are recorded at fair value based on market quotations from actively traded liquid markets. Fair value contracts consist of derivative financial instruments and are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value.Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for, and the Company elects, cash flow hedge accounting.The Company had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during any current reporting periods. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and the Company uses a fair value hierarchy of three levels that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions.Currently, for all items presented herein, the Company utilizes a market approach to valuing its contracts.On a contract by contract, forward month by forward month basis, the Company obtains observable market data for valuing its contracts.The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data.The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that may be accessed at the measurement date.Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.For Level 1 valuation of marketable securities, the Company utilizes market quotations provided by its primary financial institution and for the valuation of derivative financial instruments the Company utilizes the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX") for such valuations. Level 2 (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (b) quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities but in markets that are not actively traded or in which little information is released to the public, (c) observable inputs other than quoted prices and (d) inputs derived from observable market data.Source data for Level 2 inputs include information provided by the NYMEX, published price data and indices, third party price survey data and broker provided forward price statistics. Level 3 unobservable market data inputs for assets or liabilities. 13 As of June 30, 2016, the Company's fair value assets and liabilities are summarized and categorized as follows (in thousands): As of December 31, 2015, the Company's fair value assets and liabilities are summarized and categorized as follows (in thousands): When determining fair value measurements, the Company makes credit valuation adjustments to reflect both its own nonperformance risk and its counterparty's nonperformance risk.When adjusting the fair value of derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, and guarantees are considered.Credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as credit scores to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company or its counterparties.As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of the Company's fair value contracts.As a result, applicable fair value assets and liabilities are included in their entirety in the fair value hierarchy. Recent Accounting Pronouncement In May 2014, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.The amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.The new guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2017.Early adoption is permitted.The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application.Management is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on the Company's consolidated financial statements and the transition alternatives. In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.The standard also provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements.The new guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.Management does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. 14 In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).The standard amends existing accounting standards to require the capitalization and recording on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities associated with lease terms of more than 12 months.The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.As of December 31, 2015, the Company had rental obligations under long-term non-cancellable operating leases and terminaling arrangements totaling $12,393,000 payable through 2019, with only nominal activity during 2016.Management is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on the Company's consolidated financial statements as well as the transition alternatives. With the exception of the new standards for revenue recognition and leases, as discussed, management believes the impact of recently issued standards and updates, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption. Note 3 Segment Reporting The Company is engaged in the business of crude oil marketing as well as tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals, and oil and gas exploration and production.Information concerning the Company's various business activities is summarized as follows (in thousands): - Six Month Comparison - Three Month Comparison 15 Segment operating earnings reflect revenues net of operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization and are reconciled to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as follows (in thousands): Identifiable assets by industry segment are as follows (in thousands): Intersegment sales are insignificant and all sales occurred in the United States.Other identifiable assets are primarily corporate cash, corporate accounts receivable, investments and properties not identified with any specific segment of the Company's business.Accounting policies for transactions between reportable segments are consistent with applicable accounting policies as disclosed herein. Note 4 - Transactions with Affiliates The late Mr. K. S. Adams, Jr., former Chairman of the Board of the Company, and certain of his family partnerships and affiliates have participated as working interest owners with the Company's subsidiary, Adams Resources Exploration Corporation ( AREC")Mr. Adams and the affiliates participated on terms similar to those afforded other non-affiliated working interest owners.While the affiliates have generally maintained their existing property interest, they have not participated in any such transactions originating after the death of Mr. Adams in October 2013.In connection with the operation of certain oil and gas properties, the Company also charges such related parties for administrative overhead primarily as prescribed by the Council of Petroleum Accountants Society Bulletin 5. The Company also enters into certain transactions in the normal course of business with other affiliated entities including direct cost reimbursement for shared phone and administrative services.In addition, the Company leases office space from an affiliated entity based on a lease rental rate determined by an independent appraisal. The Company utilizes its affiliate, Bencap, to administer certain of its employee medical benefit programs including a detail audit of individual medical claims.See Note (1) to the accompanying financials under the caption "Investments" for further discussion.Bencap earns a fee from the Company for providing such services at a discounted amount from its standard charge to non-affiliates. 16 Activities with affiliates were as follows (in thousands): Note 5 - Commitments and Contingencies Under the Company's automobile and workers' compensation insurance policies, the Company can either receive a return of premium paid or be assessed for additional premiums up to pre-established limits. Additionally, in certain instances the risk of insured losses is shared with a group of similarly situated entities.The Company has appropriately recognized estimated expenses liabilities related to these policies for losses incurred but not reported to the Company or its insurance carrier as follows (in thousands): The Company maintains a self-insurance program for managing employee medical claims.A liability for expected claims incurred is established on a monthly basis.As claims are paid, the liability is relieved.The Company maintains third party insurance stop-loss coverage for annual individual medical claims exceeding $100,000.In addition, the Company maintains $2 million of umbrella insurance coverage for aggregate medical claims exceeding approximately $4.5 million for each of the calendar years ended 2016 and 2015.Medical accrued amounts are as follows (in thousands): ARECis named as a defendant in a number of Louisiana based suits involving alleged environmental contamination from prior drilling operations.Such suits typically allege improper disposal of oilfield wastes in earthen pits with one suit alleging subsidence contributing to the formation of a sink hole.AREC is currently included in three such suits.The suits are styled LePetit Chateau Deluxe v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation dated March 2004, Gustave J. LaBarre, Jr., et. al. v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation et. al. dated October 2012 and Henning Management, LLC v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation dated November 2013.Each suit involves multiple industry defendants with substantially larger proportional interests in the properties except, all the larger defendants have settled their claims in the LePetit Chateau Deluxe matter.The plaintiffs in each of these matters are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.While management does not believe that a material adverse effect will result from the claims, significant attorney fees will be incurred to defend these matters.As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has accrued $500,000 of future legal/or settlement costs for these matters. 17 From time to time as incidental to its operations, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and/or disputes.Primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet, the Company is a party to motor vehicle accidents, worker compensation claims and other items of general liability as would be typical for the industry. Management of the Company is presently unaware of any claims against the Company that are either outside the scope of insurance coverage or that may exceed the level of insurance coverage and could potentially represent a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. Item 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations - Marketing Marketing segment revenues, operating earnings, depreciation and certain costs were as follows (in thousands): _________________________________ (1) Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year. Crude oil revenues declined in 2016 as a result of reduced purchase and sale volumes and reduced market prices for crude oil. The volume decline stemmed primarily from reduced production and reduced purchase activity in the Eagle Ford shale trend of South Texas.Operating earnings were adversely affected by the volume declines as well as a narrowing of margins in 2016.Driver commissions are reduced both in terms of the number of drivers employed as well as pay scale due to the decline in activity.Fuel and insurance costs are lower, consistent with reduced volumes. Supplemental volume and price information is as follows: _____________________________ (1) Reflects the volume purchased from third parties at the oil and natural gas field level and pipeline pooling points. 18 Crude Oil Field Level Operating Earnings (Non GAAP-Measure)(1) Two significant factors affecting comparative crude oil segment operating earnings are inventory valuations and forward commodity contract (derivatives or mark-to-market) valuations.As a purchaser and shipper of crude oil, the Company holds inventory in storage tanks and third-party pipelines.Inventory sales turnover occurs approximately every three days, but the quantity held in stock at the end of a given period is reasonably consistent.As a result, during periods of increasing crude oil prices, the Company recognizes inventory liquidation gains while during periods of falling prices, the Company recognizes inventory valuation losses.Over time, these gains and losses tend to offset and have limited impact on cash flow.While crude oil prices fluctuated during the first six months of 2016 and 2015, the net impact on earnings was to yield inventory liquidation gains as shown in the table below. Crude oil marketing operating earnings are also affected by the valuations of the Company's forward month commodity contracts (derivative instruments) as of the various report dates.Such non-cash valuations are calculated and recorded at each period end based on the underlying data existing as of such date.The Company generally enters into these derivative contracts as part of a pricing strategy based on crude oil purchases at the wellhead (field level).Only those contracts qualifying as derivative instruments are accorded fair value treatment while the companion contracts to purchase crude oil at the wellhead (field level) are not accorded fair value treatment.The period-end valuation of derivative instruments requires recognition of mark-to-market" gains and losses. The impact on crude oil segment operating earnings of inventory liquidations and derivative valuations is summarized as follows in reconciling from the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures (in thousands): ____________________________________ (1) Such designation is (a) unique to the Company, (b) not a substitute for GAAP and (c) not comparable to any similar measures developed by industry participants.The Company utilizes such data to evaluate the profitability of its operations. The Company held crude oil inventory at a weighted average commodity price in barrels as follows: Field level operating earnings and field level purchase volumes (see earlier table) depict the Company's day-to-day operation of acquiring crude oil at the wellhead, transporting the material, and delivery to market at the sales point.Comparative field level operating earnings decreased during 2016 relative to the comparative 2015 periods due to reduced purchase volumes and reduced unit margins.Competition has intensified for a declining level of crude oil production within the Company's areas of operation. 19 Historically, prices received for crude oil have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue.See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. -Transportation Transportation segment revenues, earnings and depreciation are as follows (in thousands): ________________________ (1)Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year. The Company's revenue rate structure includes a component for fuel costs such that fuel cost fluctuations are largely passed through to the customer over time.To illustrate, a calculation of revenues net of fuel cost is presented below (in thousands): (1)Such designationis (a) unique to the Company, (b) not a substitute for GAAP and (c) not comparable to any similar measure developed by industry participants.The calculation is being shown to facilitate the readers comparison only. Revenues net of fuel are reduced in 2016 because of reduced demand which is indicative from the change in miles driven shown above.In addition, shippers have demanded reduced rates since the present level of demand created industry wide excess capacity.The Company has responded by selling older and excess equipment, reducing the level of personnel and working to control maintenance costs.Operating earnings declined at a rate faster than the decline in revenues due to the fixed cost component contained therein.It is believed that a change in the current market demand scenario will not occur absent continued improvement in the overall U. S. economy. 20 -Oil and Gas Oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily a function of crude oil and natural gas prices and volumes.Comparative amounts for revenues, operating earnings and depreciation and depletion are as follows (in thousands): ________________________________ (1) Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year. Oil and gas revenues and operating earnings declined in 2016 following reduced commodity prices and volume reductions as shown in the table below.Volumes declined consistent with reduced drilling activity and normal production declines.Depreciation and depletion expense is also reduced in 2016 consistent with reduced volumes and reduced net capitalized costs. Production volumes and price information is as follows: General and administrative General and administrative expenses declined from $5,649,000 during the first half of 2015 to $4,138,000 during the first half of 2016 due to a reduced employee termination costs. - Investments In January 2016, the Company acquired a 30% member interest in Bencap LLC (Bencap) for a $2,200,000 cash payment.Bencap provides medical insurance brokerage and medical claims auditing services to employers utilizing ERISA governed employee benefit plans.The Company accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting.Bencap used the Company's funding to expand its back-office and sales support functions as it seeks to compete in the medical benefits marketplace.Under equity method accounting the Company has included in operating earnings its pro-rata share of Bencap's net expenses in excess of revenues. 21 In April 2016 the Company acquired a 15% equity interest in VestaCare, Inc., a provider of electronic payment technologies to medical care providers. VestaCare is accounted for under the "cost method" and as such, earnings will be reported as dividends are paid. Outlook The trend continues to indicate reduced crude oil commodity prices and slackened demand for trucking services.As a result, the present emphasis involves aggressive sales efforts and cost control pending a rebound in the market conditions for the Company's products and services.By preserving liquidity and operating as a low-cost provider, the Company will be well positioned when general economic conditions improve. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's liquidity derives from net cash provided by operating activities and is therefore dependent on the success of future operations.The most significant source of liquidity is the cash yield from net earnings factoring in the non-cash book expense items for depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairments.The Company has no debt and funds all of its projects from this stream of cash.In most periods, cash inflows equal or exceed capital spending outflows.Should cash inflow subside or turn negative, the Company will curtail its capital spending accordingly. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no bank debt or other forms of debenture obligations.Cash balances are maintained in order to meet the timing of day-to-day cash needs and such amounts and working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, were as follows (in thousands): Cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities were as follows (in thousands): The Company relies heavily on its ability to obtain open-line trade credit from its suppliers especially with respect to its crude oil marketing operation.Because of this, the Company strives to maintain substantial cash balances and avoid debt obligations. 22 At various times each month, the Company makes cash prepayments and/or early payments in advance of the normal due date to certain suppliers of crude oil within the marketing operations.Crude oil supply prepayments are recouped and advanced from month to month as the suppliers deliver product to the Company.In addition, in order to secure crude oil supply, the Company may also early pay" its suppliers in advance of the normal payment due date of the twentieth of the month following the month of production.Such early payments" reduce cash and accounts payable as of the balance sheet date.The Company also requires certain customers to make similar early payments or to post cash collateral with the Company in order to support their purchases from the Company.Early payments and cash collateral received from customers increases cash and reduces accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date. The Company maintains a stand-by letter of credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank to provide for the issuance of up to $60million in stand-by letters of credit for the benefit of suppliers of crude oil.Stand-by letters of credit are issued as needed and are cancelled as the underlying purchase obligations are satisfied by cash payment when due.The issuance of stand-by letters of credit enables the Company to avoid posting cash collateral when procuring crude oil supply. Early payments, collateral and letters of credit amounts were as follows (in thousands): Management believes current cash balances, together with expected cash generated from future operations, and the ease of financing truck and trailer additions through leasing arrangements (should the need arise) will be sufficient to meet short-term and long-term liquidity needs. The Company utilizes cash from operations to make discretionary investments in its marketing, transportation and exploration businesses, and more recently in the area of employer oriented medical management services.The Company does not look to proceeds from property sales to fund its cash flow needs.Except for commitments totaling approximately $12.4 million associated with barge affreightment contracts, storage tank terminal arrangements and office lease space, the Company's future commitments and planned investments can be readily curtailed if operating cash flows contract. Capital project and investment spending through the first six months of 2016 and additional anticipated 2016 capital spending is as follows (in thousands): For the remainder of 2016, the primary planned capital addition is completion of the on-going Houston truck terminal expansion and improvements. 23 A quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share or $928,000 was paid during each of the first and second quarters of 2016 and 2015.The most significant item affecting future increases or decreases in liquidity is earnings from operations and such earnings are dependent on the success of future operations.See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates There have been no material changes to the Company's Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates" disclosures that have occurred since the disclosures provided in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Item 1. Financial Statements ADAMS RESOURCES &amp; ENERGY, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 - Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, in the opinion of the Company's management, include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for the fair presentation of its financial position at September 30, 2016, its results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. The impact on the accompanying financial statements of events occurring after September 30, 2016, was evaluated through the date of issuance of these financial statements. Although the Company believes the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, it is suggested that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in the Company's latest annual report on Form 10-K. The interim statement of operations is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations and Principles of Consolidation The Company is engaged in the business of crude oil marketing, tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals and oil and gas exploration and production. Its primary area of operation is within a 1,000 mile radius of Houston, Texas. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Adams Resources &amp; Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the Company") after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include any Treasury bill, commercial paper, money market fund or federal funds with maturity of 90 days or less. Depending on cash availability and market conditions, investments in corporate and municipal bonds, which are classified as investments in marketable securities, may also be made from time to time. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with major financial institutions and such deposits may exceed the amount of federally backed insurance provided. While the Company regularly monitors the financial stability of such institutions, cash and cash equivalents ultimately remain at risk subject to the financial viability of such institutions. Inventory Inventory consists of crude oil held in storage tanks and at third-party pipelines as part of the Company's crude oil marketing operations. Crude oil inventory is carried at the lower of average cost or market. 5 Prepayments The components of prepayments are as follows (in thousands): Property and Equipment Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Interest costs incurred in connection with major capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets. When properties are retired or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization is removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings. Oil and gas exploration and development expenditures are accounted for in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting. Direct costs of acquiring developed or undeveloped leasehold acreage, including lease bonus, brokerage and other fees, are capitalized. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized until the properties are evaluated and determined to be either productive or nonproductive. Such evaluations are made on a quarterly basis. If an exploratory well is determined to be nonproductive, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense. Costs incurred to drill and complete development wells, including dry holes, are capitalized. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no unevaluated or suspended exploratory drilling costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base or denominator used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. For lease and well equipment, development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. The numerator for such calculations is actual production volumes for the period. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated average useful lives of three to twenty years. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever there is evidence that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Any impairment recognized is permanent and may not be restored. Producing oil and gas properties are reviewed on a field-by-field basis. Fields with carrying values in excess of their estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are deemed impaired. For properties requiring impairment, the fair value is estimated based on an internal discounted cash flow model. Cash flows are developed based on estimated future production and prices are then discounted using a market based rate of return consistent with that used by the Company in evaluating cash flows for other assets of a similar nature. At times during 2016, the commodity price for crude oil has been in decline which, if it continues, may require the recording of future impairments in the carrying value of oil and gas properties. 6 On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the carrying value of non-producing oil and gas leasehold properties and may deem them impaired based on remaining lease term, area drilling activity and the Company's plans for the property. This fair value measure depends highly on management's assessment of the likelihood of continued exploration efforts in a given area. Therefore, such data inputs are categorized as unobservable" or Level 3" inputs. (See Fair Value Measurements" below). Importantly, this fair value measure only applies to the write-down of capitalized costs and will never result in an increase to reported earnings. Impairment provisions are included in oil and gas segment operating losses and were as follows (in thousands): Capitalized costs for non-producing oil and gas leasehold interests currently represent approximately three percent of total oil and gas property costs and are categorized as follows (in thousands): Since the Company is generally not the operator of its oil and gas property interests, it does not maintain the underlying detail acreage data and the Company is dependent on the operator when determining which specific acreage will ultimately be drilled. However, the capitalized cost detail on a property-by-property basis is reviewed by management, and deemed impaired if development is not anticipated prior to lease expiration. Onshore leasehold periods are normally three years and may contain renewal options. Investments Investments reflect the Company's interest in operating entities where the Company holds a non-controlling interest. Investments where the Company's interest is between twenty percent and fifty percent of the ownership are accounted for under the "Equity Method". Under the equity method, the initial investment is capitalized and adjusted periodically for the Company's pro-rata share of earnings and losses. Any dividends received will reduce the equity investment balance. Investments where the Company's interest is less than twenty percent are accounted for on the "Cost Method". Under the cost method, the initial investment is capitalized, but no adjustments are made to capitalized costs for the underlying earnings of the investments. For cost method investments, dividends are recorded as income upon receipt. 7 On January 14, 2016 the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Adams Resources Medical Management, Inc. ("ARMM") acquired a 30% member interest in Bencap LLC ("Bencap") for a $2,200,000 cash payment. Bencap provides medical insurance brokerage and medical claims auditing services to employers utilizing ERISA governed employee benefit plans. The Company accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting. Bencap may require additional funding as it completes development of its operations. To fund such needs, on or after December 5, 2016 but before October 31, 2018, Bencap may request to borrow from ARMM an amount no greater than $1,500,000 and on or after September 1, 2017, but before August 31, 2019, Bencap may request to borrow an amount no greater than $2,000,000. ARMM is under no obligation to make such loans. However, in the event ARMM elects not to make such loans, ARMM's interest in Bencap is forfeited. Bencap is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to make cash distributions during any period when such loans remain outstanding. Bencap's predecessor entities began operating in their current form in January 2014. Presently, Bencap's primary focus is developing a general market for its medical claims auditing services. Unlike the traditional approach to employee medical insurance, Bencap's methodology audits and pays claims based on a multiplier which takes into consideration a premium over Medicare rates and/or a premium over the "Cost-to-Charge Ratio" which facility providers must file with the Federal government. The Company has utilized this methodology over the past three years to process and pay medical claims for its employees, including all management personnel. In April 2016 the Company, through its ARMM subsidiary, acquired an approximate 15% equity interest (less than 3% voting interest) in VestaCare, Inc., a California corporation ("VestaCare"), for a $2,500,000 cash payment. VestaCare provides an array of software as a service ("SaaS") electronic payment technologies to medical providers, payers and patients including VestaCare's most recent product offering, VestaPay . VestaPay allows medical care providers to structure fully automated and dynamically updating electronic payment plans for their patients. As deductibles and copays have risen in recent years, medical care providers are experiencing a significant shift in revenues from the insurance company to the individual patient. The increasing level of patient obligations has led to significantly increased bad debt write-offs for providers. The VestaCare product earns a contingent collection fee and handling fees as account collections improve. The Company's investments are considered long-lived assets and will be reviewed for impairment whenever there is evidence that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. These fair value measures depend highly on management's assessment of the financial status of the underlying operation. Such data inputs are "unobservable" or "Level 3" inputs. The Company's Bencap and VestaCare investments are in the early stage of product implementation. The Company monitors revenue and product acceptance trends in order to assess the current fair value of the investment. If the fair value of these investments is determined to be below their carrying value and that loss in fair value is deemed other than temporary, an investment loss will be recognized. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company completed a review of its equity method investment in Bencap and determined there was an other than temporary impairment. Underlying this decision are the terms of the investment agreement where Bencap has the option to request borrowings up to $1,500,000 on or after December 5, 2016 but before October 31, 2018. Given Bencap's lower than projected revenue growth and operating losses, the Company is unlikely to loan any requested funds causing forfeiture of the investment, leading to the decision to fully impair the investment. The Company recognized a net loss of $1,430,000 from its investment in Bencap as of September 30, 2016. This loss included a pre-tax impairment charge of $1,732,000 and pre-tax losses from the equity method investment of $468,000. 8 Cash Deposits and Other Assets The Company has established certain deposits to support participation in its liability insurance program and remittance of state crude oil severance taxes and other state collateral deposits. Insurance collateral deposits are invested at the discretion of the Company's insurance carrier and such investments primarily consist of intermediate term federal government bonds and bonds backed by federal agencies. This fair value measure relies on inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and is thus categorized as a Level 2" valuation in the fair value hierarchy. Components of cash deposits and other assets are as follows (in thousands): Revenue Recognition Certain commodity purchase and sale contracts utilized by the Company's marketing business qualify as derivative instruments with certain specifically identified contracts also designated as trading activity. From the time of contract origination, such trading activity contracts are marked-to-market and recorded on a net revenue basis in the accompanying financial statements. Most crude oil purchase contracts and sale contracts qualify and are designated as non-trading activities and the Company considers such contracts as normal purchases and sales activity. For normal purchases and sales, the Company's customers are invoiced monthly based upon contractually agreed upon terms with revenue recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer. Such sales are recorded gross in the financial statements because the Company takes title, has risk of loss for the products, is the primary obligor for the purchase, establishes the sale price independently with a third party and maintains credit risk associated with the sale of the product. Certain crude oil contracts may be with a single counterparty to provide for similar quantities of crude oil to be bought and sold at different locations. These contracts are entered into for a variety of reasons, including effecting the transportation of the commodity, to minimize credit exposure, and/or to meet the competitive demands of the customer. Such buy/sell arrangements are reflected on a net revenue basis in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Reporting such crude oil contracts on a gross revenue basis would increase the Company's reported revenues as follows (in thousands): Transportation segment customers are invoiced, and the related revenue is recognized, as the service is provided. Oil and gas revenue from the Company's interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and gas passes to the purchaser. Sales of Long-lived assets Gains and losses from the sale or disposal of long-lived assets that do not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation are presented in the accompanying financial statements as a component of operating earnings. 9 Concentration of Credit Risk The Company's largest customers consist of large multinational integrated oil companies and independent refiners of crude oil. In addition, the Company transacts business with independent oil producers, major chemical concerns, crude oil trading companies and a variety of commercial energy users. Within this group of customers the Company generally derives approximately 50 percent of its revenues from three to five large crude oil refining concerns. While the Company has ongoing established relationships with certain domestic refiners of crude oil, alternative markets are readily available since the Company supplies less than one percent of U.S. domestic refiner demand. As a fungible commodity delivered to major Gulf Coast supply points, the Company's crude oil sales can be readily delivered to alternative end markets. Management believes that a loss of any customers where the Company currently derives more than 10 percent of its revenues would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations. Accounts receivable associated with crude oil activities comprise approximately 90 percent of the Company's total receivables and industry practice requires payment for such sales to occur within 20 days of the end of the month following a transaction. The Company's customer makeup, credit policies and the relatively short duration of receivables mitigate the uncertainty typically associated with receivables management. Letter of Credit Facility The Company maintains a Credit and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank to provide up to a $60 million stand-by letter of credit facility used to support crude oil purchases within the marketing segment. This facility is collateralized by the eligible accounts receivable within the segment and outstanding amounts were as follows (in thousands): The issued stand-by letters of credit are cancelled as the underlying purchase obligations are satisfied by cash payment when due. The letter of credit facility places certain restrictions on the Company's Gulfmark Energy, Inc. subsidiary. Such restrictions include the maintenance of a combined 1.1 to 1.0 current ratio and the maintenance of positive net earnings excluding inventory valuation changes, as defined, among other restrictions. The Company is currently in compliance with all such financial covenants. Statement of Cash Flows There were no significant non-cash financing activities in any of the periods reported. Statements of cash flow disclosure items include the following (in thousands): 10 Capitalized amounts included in property and equipment that were not included in amounts reported for cash additions in the Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable report dates were as follows (in thousands): Earnings Per Share Earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock shares outstanding during the period presented herein. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 4,217,596 for 2016 and 2015. There were no potentially dilutive securities during those periods. Share-Based Payments During the periods presented herein, the Company had neither stock-based employee compensation plans nor any other share-based payment arrangements. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Examples of significant estimates used in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include oil and gas reserve volumes forming the foundation for calculating depreciation, depletion and amortization and for estimating cash flows when assessing impairment triggers and when estimating values associated with oil and gas properties. Other examples include revenue accruals, the provision for bad debts, insurance related accruals, income tax permanent and timing differences, contingencies and valuation of fair value contracts. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Use of Derivative Instruments The Company's marketing segment is involved in the purchase and sale of crude oil. The Company seeks to profit by procuring the commodity as it is produced and then delivering the material to the end users or the intermediate use marketplace. As typical for the industry, such transactions are made pursuant to the terms of forward month commodity purchase and/or sale contracts. Some of these contracts meet the definition of a derivative instrument, and therefore, the Company accounts for such contracts at fair value, unless the normal purchase and sale exception is applicable. Such underlying contracts are standard for the industry and are the governing document for the Company's crude oil wholesale distribution businesses. None of the Company's derivative instruments have been designated as hedging instruments. The accounting methodology utilized by the Company for its commodity contracts is further discussed below under the caption Fair Value Measurements". 11 The estimated fair value of forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) is reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 as follows (in thousands): As of September 30, 2016, three commodity purchase and sale contracts comprise the Company's derivative valuations. These contracts encompass approximately 65 barrels per day of diesel fuel during October 2016 through March 2017, 142,000 barrels of crude oil for the month of November 2016 and 3,000 barrels of crude oil during October 2016 through December 2016. Forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) are reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 as follows (in thousands): As of December 31, 2015, one commodity purchase and sale contract comprised the Company's derivative valuations. The purchase and sale contract encompasses approximately 65 barrels per day of diesel fuel in each of January, February and March 2016. The Company only enters into commodity contracts with creditworthy counterparties or obtains collateral support for such activities. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was not holding nor has it posted any collateral to support its forward month fair value derivative activity. The Company is not subject to any credit-risk related trigger events. The Company has no other financial investment arrangements that would serve to offset its derivative contracts. 12 Forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) are reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as follows (in thousands): Earnings Earnings Nine Months Ended Three Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Revenues Marketing $ 305 $ (158) $ 181 $ (208) Fair Value Measurements The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. Marketable securities are recorded at fair value based on market quotations from actively traded liquid markets. Fair value contracts consist of derivative financial instruments and are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for, and the Company elects, cash flow hedge accounting. The Company had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during any current reporting periods. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and the Company uses a fair value hierarchy of three levels that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Currently, for all items presented herein, the Company utilizes a market approach to valuing its contracts. On a contract by contract, forward month by forward month basis, the Company obtains observable market data for valuing its contracts. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data. The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that may be accessed at the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. For Level 1 valuation of marketable securities, the Company utilizes market quotations provided by its primary financial institution and for the valuation of derivative financial instruments the Company utilizes the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX") for such valuations. Level 2 (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (b) quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities but in markets that are not actively traded or in which little information is released to the public, (c) observable inputs other than quoted prices and (d) inputs derived from observable market data. Source data for Level 2 inputs include information provided by the NYMEX, published price data and indices, third party price survey data and broker provided forward price statistics. Level 3 unobservable market data inputs for assets or liabilities. 13 As of September 30, 2016, the Company's fair value assets and liabilities are summarized and categorized as follows (in thousands): As of December 31, 2015, the Company's fair value assets and liabilities are summarized and categorized as follows (in thousands): When determining fair value measurements, the Company makes credit valuation adjustments to reflect both its own nonperformance risk and its counterparty's nonperformance risk. When adjusting the fair value of derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, and guarantees are considered. Credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as credit scores to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company or its counterparties. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of the Company's fair value contracts. As a result, applicable fair value assets and liabilities are included in their entirety in the fair value hierarchy. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. Management is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on the Company's consolidated financial statements as well as the transition alternatives. In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. The standard also provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. Management does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 14 In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The standard amends existing accounting standards to require the capitalization and recording on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities associated with lease terms of more than 12 months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had rental obligations under long-term non-cancellable operating leases and terminaling arrangements totaling $12,393,000 payable through 2019, with only nominal activity during 2016. Management is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on the Company's consolidated financial statements as well as the transition alternatives. In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)" which is intended to clarify and align how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows where there is currently diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 specifically addresses eight classification issues within the statement of cash flows including proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; distributions received from equity method investees; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Management is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on the Company's consolidated financial statements. With the exception of the new standards for revenue recognition and leases, as discussed, management believes the impact of recently issued standards and updates, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption. Note 3 Segment Reporting The Company is engaged in the business of crude oil marketing as well as tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals, and oil and gas exploration and production. Information concerning the Company's various business activities is summarized as follows (in thousands): - Nine Month Comparison 15 - Three Month Comparison Segment operating earnings reflect revenues net of operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization and are reconciled to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as follows (in thousands): Identifiable assets by industry segment are as follows (in thousands) : Intersegment sales are insignificant and all sales occurred in the United States. Other identifiable assets are primarily corporate cash, corporate accounts receivable, investments and properties not identified with any specific segment of the Company's business. Accounting policies for transactions between reportable segments are consistent with applicable accounting policies as disclosed herein. 16 Note 4 - Transactions with Affiliates The late Mr. K. S. Adams, Jr., former Chairman of the Board of the Company, and certain of his family partnerships and affiliates have participated as working interest owners with the Company's subsidiary, Adams Resources Exploration Corporation ( AREC") Mr. Adams and the affiliates participated on terms similar to those afforded other non-affiliated working interest owners. While the affiliates have generally maintained their existing property interest, they have not participated in any such transactions originating after the death of Mr. Adams in October 2013. In connection with the operation of certain oil and gas properties, the Company also charges such related parties for administrative overhead primarily as prescribed by the Council of Petroleum Accountants Society Bulletin 5. The Company also enters into certain transactions in the normal course of business with other affiliated entities including direct cost reimbursement for shared phone and administrative services. In addition, the Company leases office space from an affiliated entity based on a lease rental rate determined by an independent appraisal. The Company utilizes its affiliate, Bencap, to administer certain of its employee medical benefit programs including a detail audit of individual medical claims. See Note (1) to the accompanying financials under the caption "Investments" for further discussion. Bencap earns a fee from the Company for providing such services at a discounted amount from its standard charge to non-affiliates. The Company's former Chief Financial Officer, upon retiring from the Company in September 2016, elected to invest in Bencap LLC acquiring a six percent member interest in Bencap in exchange for a $440,000 cash contribution. Activities with affiliates were as follows (in thousands): Note 5 - Commitments and Contingencies Under the Company's automobile and workers' compensation insurance policies, the Company can either receive a return of premium paid or be assessed for additional premiums up to pre-established limits. Additionally, in certain instances the risk of insured losses is shared with a group of similarly situated entities. The Company has appropriately recognized estimated expenses and liabilities related to these policies for losses incurred but not reported to the Company or its insurance carrier as follows (in thousands): _________________________________ (1) Premiums paid and expensed for which possible and anticipated claims that have not been reported and/or fully developed as of the balance sheet date. 17 The Company maintains a self-insurance program for managing employee medical claims. A liability for expected claims incurred is established on a monthly basis. As claims are paid, the liability is relieved. The Company maintains third party insurance stop-loss coverage for annual individual medical claims exceeding $100,000. In addition, the Company maintains $2 million of umbrella insurance coverage for aggregate medical claims exceeding approximately $4.5 million for each of the calendar years ended 2016 and 2015. Medical accrued amounts are as follows (in thousands): AREC is named as a defendant in a number of Louisiana based suits involving alleged environmental contamination from prior drilling operations. Such suits typically allege improper disposal of oilfield wastes in earthen pits with one suit alleging subsidence contributing to the formation of a sink hole. AREC is currently included in three such suits. The suits are styled LePetit Chateau Deluxe v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation dated March 2004, Gustave J. LaBarre, Jr., et. al. v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation et. al. dated October 2012 and Henning Management, LLC v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation dated November 2013. Each suit involves multiple industry defendants with substantially larger proportional interests in the properties. In the LePetit Chateau Deluxe matter all of the larger defendants have settled the case. The plaintiffs in each of these matters are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. While management does not believe that a material adverse effect will result from the claims, significant attorney fees will be incurred to defend these matters. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has accrued $500,000 of future legal/or settlement costs for these matters. From time to time as incidental to its operations, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and/or disputes. Primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet, the Company is a party to motor vehicle accidents, worker compensation claims and other items of general liability as would be typical for the industry. Management of the Company is presently unaware of any claims against the Company that are either outside the scope of insurance coverage or that may exceed the level of insurance coverage and could potentially represent a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. 18 Item 2 . MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations - Marketing Marketing segment revenues, operating earnings, depreciation and certain costs were as follows ( in thousands ): _________________________________ (1) Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year. Crude oil revenues declined in 2016 as a result of reduced purchase and sale volumes and reduced market prices for crude oil. The volume decline stemmed primarily from reduced production and reduced purchase activity in the Eagle Ford shale trend of South Texas and North Dakota. Operating earnings were adversely affected by the volume declines as well as a narrowing of margins in 2016. Driver commissions are reduced both in terms of the number of drivers employed as well as pay scale due to the decline in activity. Fuel and insurance costs are lower, consistent with reduced volumes. Supplemental volume and price information is as follows: _____________________________ (1) Reflects the volume purchased from third parties at the oil and natural gas field level and pipeline pooling points. 19 Crude Oil Field Level Operating Earnings (Non GAAP-Measure) (1) Two significant factors affecting comparative crude oil segment operating earnings are inventory valuations and forward commodity contract (derivatives or mark-to-market) valuations. As a purchaser and shipper of crude oil, the Company holds inventory in storage tanks and third-party pipelines. Inventory sales turnover occurs approximately every three days, but the quantity held in stock at the end of a given period is reasonably consistent. As a result, during periods of increasing crude oil prices, the Company recognizes inventory liquidation gains while during periods of falling prices, the Company recognizes inventory valuation losses. Over time, these gains and losses tend to offset and have limited impact on cash flow. While crude oil prices fluctuated during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, the net impact on earnings was to yield inventory liquidation gains and losses as shown in the table below. Crude oil marketing operating earnings are also affected by the valuations of the Company's forward month commodity contracts (derivative instruments) as of the various report dates. Such non-cash valuations are calculated and recorded at each period end based on the underlying data existing as of such date. The Company generally enters into these derivative contracts as part of a pricing strategy based on crude oil purchases at the wellhead (field level). Only those contracts qualifying as derivative instruments are accorded fair value treatment while the companion contracts to purchase crude oil at the wellhead (field level) are not accorded fair value treatment. The period-end valuation of derivative instruments requires recognition of mark-to-market" gains and losses. The impact on crude oil segment operating earnings of inventory liquidations and derivative valuations is summarized as follows in reconciling from the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures (in thousands): ____________________________________ (1) Such designation is (a) unique to the Company, (b) not a substitute for GAAP and (c) not comparable to any similar measures developed by industry participants. The Company utilizes such data to evaluate the profitability of its operations. The Company held crude oil inventory at a weighted average commodity price in barrels as follows: Field level operating earnings and field level purchase volumes (see earlier table) depict the Company's day-to-day operation of acquiring crude oil at the wellhead, transporting the material, and delivery to market at the sales point. Comparative field level operating earnings decreased during 2016 relative to the comparative 2015 periods due to reduced purchase volumes and reduced unit margins. Competition has intensified for a declining level of crude oil production within the Company's areas of operation. 20 Historically, prices received for crude oil have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. - Transportation Transportation segment revenues, earnings and depreciation are as follows ( in thousands ): ________________________ (1) Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year. The Company's revenue rate structure includes a component for fuel costs such that fuel cost fluctuations are largely passed through to the customer over time. To illustrate, a calculation of revenues net of fuel cost is presented below (in thousands): _____________________________ (1) Such designation is (a) unique to the Company, (b) not a substitute for GAAP and (c) not comparable to any similar measure developed by industry participants. Revenues net of fuel are reduced in 2016 because of reduced demand which is indicative from the change in miles driven shown above. In addition, shippers have demanded reduced rates since the present level of demand created industry wide excess capacity. The Company has responded by selling older and excess equipment, reducing the level of personnel and working to control maintenance costs. Operating earnings declined at a rate faster than the decline in revenues due to the fixed cost component contained therein. It is believed that a change in the current market demand scenario will not occur absent continued improvement in the overall U. S. economy. 21 - Oil and Gas Oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily a function of crude oil and natural gas prices and volumes. Comparative amounts for revenues, operating earnings and depreciation and depletion are as follows (in thousands): ________________________________ (1) Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year. Oil and gas revenues declined in 2016 following reduced commodity prices and volume reductions as shown in the table below. Operating losses decreased in 2016 due to reduced depreciation, amortization and impairment charges as a result of prior year impairments and a reduction in capital expenditures. Volumes declined consistent with reduced drilling activity and normal production declines. Depreciation and depletion expense is also reduced in 2016 consistent with reduced volumes and reduced net capitalized costs. Production volumes and price information is as follows: General and administrative General and administrative expenses declined from $7,750,000 during the first nine months of 2015 to $6,252,000 during the first nine months of 2016 primarily as the result of reduced employee termination costs in 2016. 22 Investments In January 2016, the Company acquired a 30% member interest in Bencap LLC (Bencap) for a $2,200,000 cash payment. Bencap provides medical insurance brokerage and medical claims auditing services to employers utilizing ERISA governed employee benefit plans. The Company accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting. Bencap used the Company's funding to expand its back-office and sales support functions as it seeks to compete in the medical benefits marketplace. Under equity method accounting the Company has included in operating earnings its pro-rata share of Bencap's net expenses in excess of revenues. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company completed a review of its equity method investment in Bencap and determined there was an other than temporary impairment. Underlying this decision are the terms of the investment agreement where Bencap has the option to request borrowings up to $1,500,000 on or after December 5, 2016 but before October 31, 2018. Given Bencap's lower than projected revenue growth and operating losses, the Company is unlikely to loan any requested funds causing forfeiture of the investment, leading to the decision to fully impair the investment. The Company recognized a net loss of $1,430,000 from its investment in Bencap as of September 30, 2016. This loss included a pre-tax impairment charge of $1,732,000 and pre-tax losses from the equity method investment of $468,000. In April 2016 the Company acquired a 15% equity interest in VestaCare, Inc., a provider of electronic payment technologies to medical care providers. VestaCare is accounted for under the "cost method" and as such, earnings will be reported as dividends are paid. Outlook The trend continues to indicate suppressed crude oil commodity prices and slackened demand for trucking services. As a result, the present emphasis involves aggressive sales efforts and cost control pending a rebound in the market conditions for the Company's products and services. By preserving liquidity and operating as a low-cost provider, the Company will be well positioned when general economic conditions improve. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's liquidity derives from net cash provided by operating activities and is therefore dependent on the success of future operations. The most significant source of liquidity is the cash yield from net earnings factoring in the non-cash book expense items for depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairments. The Company has no debt and funds all of its projects from this stream of cash. In most periods, cash inflows equal or exceed capital spending outflows. Should cash inflow subside or turn negative, the Company will curtail its capital spending accordingly. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no bank debt or other forms of debenture obligations. Cash balances are maintained in order to meet the timing of day-to-day cash needs and such amounts and working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, were as follows (in thousands): 23 Cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities were as follows (in thousands): For the comparative periods, operating activities for 2015 provided cash of $23,561,000 versus a use of cash of $3,339,000 for the 2016 period. This trend reversal was caused by reduced earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization coupled with increased physical inventory quantities in 2016. Increased inventory quantities are a result of the Company's current strategy to capture the difference between current and future prices for crude oil. The Company relies heavily on its ability to obtain open-line trade credit from its suppliers especially with respect to its crude oil marketing operation. Because of this, the Company strives to maintain substantial cash balances and avoid debt obligations. At various times each month, the Company makes cash prepayments and/or early payments in advance of the normal due date to certain suppliers of crude oil within the marketing operations. Crude oil supply prepayments are recouped and advanced from month to month as the suppliers deliver product to the Company. In addition, in order to secure crude oil supply, the Company may also early pay" its suppliers in advance of the normal payment due date of the twentieth of the month following the month of production. Such early payments" reduce cash and accounts payable as of the balance sheet date. The Company also requires certain customers to make similar early payments or to post cash collateral with the Company in order to support their purchases from the Company. Early payments and cash collateral received from customers increases cash and reduces accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date. The Company maintains a stand-by letter of credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank to provide for the issuance of up to $60 million in stand-by letters of credit for the benefit of suppliers of crude oil. Stand-by letters of credit are issued as needed and are cancelled as the underlying purchase obligations are satisfied by cash payment when due. The issuance of stand-by letters of credit enables the Company to avoid posting cash collateral when procuring crude oil supply. Early payments, collateral and letters of credit amounts were as follows (in thousands): Management believes current cash balances, together with expected cash generated from future operations, and the ease of financing truck and trailer additions through leasing arrangements (should the need arise) will be sufficient to meet short-term and long-term liquidity needs. 24 The Company utilizes cash from operations to make discretionary investments in its marketing, transportation and exploration businesses, and more recently in the area of employer oriented medical management services. The Company does not look to proceeds from property sales to fund its cash flow needs. Except for commitments totaling approximately $12.4 million associated with barge affreightment contracts, storage tank terminal arrangements and office lease space, the Company's future commitments and planned investments can be readily curtailed if operating cash flows contract. Capital project and investment spending through the first nine months of 2016 and additional anticipated 2016 capital spending is as follows (in thousands): For the remainder of 2016, the primary planned capital addition is completion of the on-going Houston truck terminal expansion and improvements. A quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share or $928,000 was paid during each of the first, second and third quarters of 2016 and 2015. The most significant item affecting future increases or decreases in liquidity is earnings from operations and such earnings are dependent on the success of future operations. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates There have been no material changes to the Company's Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates" disclosures that have occurred since the disclosures provided in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Item 1. Financial Statements ADAMS RESOURCES &amp; ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (In thousands, except per share data) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements. 2 ADAMS RESOURCES &amp; ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In thousands) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements. 3 ADAMS RESOURCES &amp; ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (In thousands) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements 4 ADAMS RESOURCES &amp; ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 - Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, in the opinion of Adams Resources &amp; Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") management, include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for the fair presentation of its financial position at March 31, 2017, its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 and its cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. Although the Company believes the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, it is suggested that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K. The interim statement of operations is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations and Principles of Consolidation The Company is engaged in the business of crude oil marketing, tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals and dry bulk, and oil and gas exploration and production. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include any Treasury bill, commercial paper, money market fund or federal funds with maturity of 90 days or less. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with major financial institutions and such deposits may exceed the amount of federally backed insurance provided. While the Company regularly monitors the financial stability of such institutions, cash and cash equivalents ultimately remain at risk subject to the financial viability of such institutions. Inventory Inventory consists of crude oil held in storage tanks and at third-party pipelines as part of the Company's crude oil marketing operations. Crude oil inventory is carried at the lower of average cost or "net realizable value". 5 Prepayments The components of prepayments are as follows (in thousands): Property and Equipment Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Interest costs incurred in connection with major capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets. When properties are retired or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization is removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings. Oil and gas exploration and development expenditures are accounted for in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting. Direct costs of acquiring developed or undeveloped leasehold acreage, including lease bonus, brokerage and other fees, are capitalized. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized until the properties are evaluated and determined to be either productive or nonproductive. Such evaluations are made on a quarterly basis. If an exploratory well is determined to be nonproductive, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense. Costs incurred to drill and complete development wells, including dry holes, are capitalized. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had no unevaluated or suspended exploratory drilling costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base or denominator used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. For lease and well equipment, development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. The numerator for such calculations is actual production volumes for the period. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated average useful lives of three to twenty years. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever there is evidence that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Any impairment recognized is permanent and may not be restored. Producing oil and gas properties are reviewed on a field-by-field basis. Fields with carrying values in excess of their estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are deemed impaired. For properties requiring impairment, the fair value is estimated based on an internal discounted cash flow model. Cash flows are developed based on estimated future production and prices are then discounted using a market based rate of return consistent with that used by the Company in evaluating cash flows for other assets of a similar nature. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the carrying value of non-producing oil and gas leasehold properties and may deem them impaired based on remaining lease term, area drilling activity and the Company's plans for the property. This fair value measure depends highly on management's assessment of the likelihood of continued exploration efforts in a given area. Therefore, such data inputs are categorized as unobservable" or Level 3" inputs. (See Fair Value Measurements" below). Importantly, this fair value measure only applies to the write-down of capitalized costs and will never result in an increase to reported earnings. 6 Impairment provisions are included in oil and gas segment operating losses and were as follows (in thousands): Since the Company is no longer the operator of its oil and gas property interests, it does not maintain the underlying detail acreage data and the Company is dependent on the operator when determining which specific acreage will ultimately be drilled. However, the capitalized cost detail on a property-by-property basis is reviewed by management, and deemed impaired if development is not anticipated prior to lease expiration. Onshore leasehold periods are normally three years and may contain renewal options. Investments In December 2015 the Company formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, Adams Resources Medical Management, Inc. (ARMM), and in January 2016 ARMM acquired a 30% member interest in Bencap LLC (Bencap) for a $2.2 million cash payment. Bencap provides medical insurance brokerage and medical claims auditing services to employers utilizing ERISA governed employee benefit plans. The Company has accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company completed a review of its equity method investment in Bencap and determined there was an other than temporary impairment. Underlying this was the terms of the investment agreement where Bencap had the option to request borrowings up to $1.5 million (on or after December 5, 2016 but before October 31, 2018) that the Company must provide or forfeit its 30% member interest. During the third quarter of 2016, management of the Company determined that it was unlikely to provide additional funding due to Bencap's lower than projected revenue growth and operating losses since investment inception. As a result, the Company recognized a net loss of $1.4 million from its investment in Bencap as of September 30, 2016. This loss included a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.7 million and pre-tax losses from the equity method investment of $0.5 million. In February 2017, Bencap requested additional funding of approximately $0.5 million and the Company declined the additional funding request and forfeited its 30% member interest in BenCap. In April 2016 the Company, through its ARMM subsidiary, acquired an approximate 15% equity interest (less than 3% voting interest) in VestaCare, Inc., a California corporation ("VestaCare"), for a $2.5 million cash payment. VestaCare provides an array of software as a service ("SaaS") electronic payment technologies to medical providers, payers and patients including VestaCare's most recent product offering, VestaPay . VestaPay allows medical care providers to structure fully automated and dynamically updating electronic payment plans for their patients. The Company has accounted for this investment under the cost method of accounting for investments. The Company does not currently have any plans to pursue additional medical-related investments. 7 The Company's remaining investment in VestaCare, Inc. is considered a long-lived asset and will be reviewed for impairment whenever there is evidence that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable. These fair value measures depend highly on management's assessment of the financial status of the underlying operation. Such data inputs are "unobservable" or "Level 3" inputs. Cash Deposits and Other Assets The Company has established certain deposits to support participation in its liability insurance program and remittance of state crude oil severance taxes and other state collateral deposits. Insurance collateral deposits are invested at the discretion of the Company's insurance carrier and such investments primarily consist of intermediate term federal government bonds and bonds backed by federal agencies. This fair value measure relies on inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and is thus categorized as a Level 2" valuation in the fair value hierarchy. Components of cash deposits and other assets are as follows (in thousands): Revenue Recognition Certain commodity purchase and sale contracts utilized by the Company's marketing business qualify as derivative instruments with certain specifically identified contracts also designated as trading activity. From the time of contract origination, such trading activity contracts are marked-to-market and recorded on a net revenue basis in the accompanying financial statements. Most crude oil purchase contracts and sale contracts qualify and are designated as non-trading activities and the Company considers such contracts as normal purchases and sales activity. For normal purchases and sales, the Company's customers are invoiced monthly based upon contractually agreed upon terms with revenue recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer. Such sales are recorded gross in the financial statements because the Company takes title, has risk of loss for the products, is the primary obligor for the purchase, establishes the sale price independently with a third party and maintains credit risk associated with the sale of the product. Certain crude oil contracts may be with a single counterparty to provide for similar quantities of crude oil to be bought and sold at different locations. These contracts are entered into for a variety of reasons, including effecting the transportation of the commodity, to minimize credit exposure, and/or to meet the competitive demands of the customer. Such buy/sell arrangements are reflected on a net revenue basis in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Reporting such crude oil contracts on a gross revenue basis would increase the Company's reported revenues as follows (in thousands): Transportation segment customers are invoiced, and the related revenue is recognized, as the service is provided. Oil and gas revenue from the Company's interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and gas passes to the purchaser. 8 Sales of Long-lived assets Gains and losses from the sale or disposal of long-lived assets that do not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation are presented in the accompanying financial statements as a component of operating earnings. Concentration of Credit Risk The Company's largest customers consist of large multinational integrated oil companies and independent refiners of crude oil. In addition, the Company transacts business with independent oil producers, major chemical concerns, crude oil trading companies and a variety of commercial energy users. Within this group of customers the Company generally derives approximately 50 percent of its revenues from three to five crude oil refining concerns. While the Company has ongoing established relationships with certain domestic refiners of crude oil, alternative markets are readily available since the Company supplies less than one percent of U.S. domestic refiner demand. As a fungible commodity delivered to various supply points, the Company's crude oil sales can be readily delivered to alternative end markets. Management believes that a loss of any of those customers where the Company currently derives more than 10 percent of its revenues would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations. Accounts receivable associated with crude oil activities comprise approximately 90 percent of the Company's total receivables and industry practice requires payment for such sales to occur within 20 days of the end of the month following a transaction. The Company's customer makeup, credit policies and the relatively short duration of receivables mitigate the uncertainty typically associated with receivables management. Letter of Credit Facility The Company maintains a Credit and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank to provide up to a $60 million stand-by letter of credit facility used to support crude oil purchases within the marketing segment. This facility is collateralized by the eligible accounts receivable within the segment and outstanding amounts were as follows (in thousands): The issued stand-by letters of credit are cancelled as the underlying purchase obligations are satisfied by cash payment when due. The letter of credit facility places certain restrictions on Gulfmark Energy, Inc. the Company's wholly owned subsidiary. Such restrictions include the maintenance of a combined 1.1 to 1.0 current ratio and the maintenance of positive net earnings excluding inventory valuation changes, as defined, among other restrictions. The Company is currently in compliance with all such financial covenants. 9 Statement of Cash Flows There were no significant non-cash financing activities in any of the periods reported. Statements of cash flow disclosure items include the following (in thousands): Capitalized amounts included in property and equipment that were not included in amounts reported for cash additions in the Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable report dates were as follows (in thousands): Earnings Per Share Earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock shares outstanding during the period presented herein. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 4,217,596 for 2017 and 2016. There were no potentially dilutive securities during those periods. Share-Based Payments During the periods presented herein, the Company had neither stock-based employee compensation plans nor any other share-based payment arrangements. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Examples of significant estimates used in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include oil and gas reserve volumes forming the foundation for calculating depreciation, depletion and amortization and for estimating cash flows when assessing impairment triggers and when estimating values associated with oil and gas properties. Other examples include revenue accruals, the provision for bad debts, insurance related accruals, income tax permanent and timing differences, contingencies and valuation of fair value contracts. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. 10 Use of Derivative Instruments The Company's marketing segment is involved in the purchase and sale of crude oil. The Company seeks to profit by procuring the commodity as it is produced and then delivering the material to the end users or the intermediate use marketplace. As typical for the industry, such transactions are made pursuant to the terms of forward month commodity purchase and/or sale contracts. Some of these contracts meet the definition of a derivative instrument, and therefore, the Company accounts for such contracts at fair value, unless the normal purchase and sale exception is applicable. Such underlying contracts are standard for the industry and are the governing document for the Company's crude oil marketing segment. None of the Company's derivative instruments have been designated as hedging instruments. The accounting methodology utilized by the Company for its commodity contracts is further discussed below under the caption Fair Value Measurements". The estimated fair value of forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) is reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2017 as follows (in thousands): As of March 31, 2017, four commodity purchase and sale contracts comprise the Company's derivative valuations. These contracts encompass 145,000 barrels of crude oil during April 2017 through May 2017. Forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) are reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016 as follows (in thousands): As of December 31, 2016, two contracts comprised the Company's derivative valuations. These contracts encompass approximately 65 barrels per day of diesel fuel during January through March 2017 and 145,000 barrels of crude oil during January 2017 through April 2017. 11 The Company only enters into commodity contracts with creditworthy counterparties and evaluates its exposure to significant counterparties on an ongoing basis. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company was not holding nor has it posted any collateral to support its forward month fair value derivative activity. The Company is not subject to any credit-risk related trigger events. The Company has no other financial investment arrangements that would serve to offset its derivative contracts. Forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) are reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 as follows (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. Marketable securities are recorded at fair value based on market quotations from actively traded liquid markets. Fair value contracts consist of derivative financial instruments and are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for, and the Company elects, cash flow hedge accounting. The Company had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during any current reporting periods. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and the Company uses a fair value hierarchy of three levels that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Currently, for all items presented herein, the Company utilizes a market approach to valuing its contracts. On a contract by contract, forward month by forward month basis, the Company obtains observable market data for valuing its contracts. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data. The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that may be accessed at the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. For Level 1 valuation of marketable securities, the Company utilizes market quotations provided by its primary financial institution and for the valuation of derivative financial instruments the Company utilizes the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX") for such valuations. Level 2 (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (b) quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities but in markets that are not actively traded or in which little information is released to the public, (c) observable inputs other than quoted prices and (d) inputs derived from observable market data. Source data for Level 2 inputs include information provided by the NYMEX, published price data and indices, third party price survey data and broker provided forward price statistics. Level 3 unobservable market data inputs for assets or liabilities. 12 As of March 31, 2017, the Company's fair value assets and liabilities are summarized and categorized as follows (in thousands): As of December 31, 2016, the Company's fair value assets and liabilities are summarized and categorized as follows (in thousands): When determining fair value measurements, the Company makes credit valuation adjustments to reflect both its own nonperformance risk and its counterparty's nonperformance risk. When adjusting the fair value of derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, considered. Credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as credit scores to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company or its counterparties. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of the Company's fair value contracts. As a result, applicable fair value assets and liabilities are included in their entirety in the fair value hierarchy. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)." Topic 606 is based on the core principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Topic 606 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. 13 Topic 606 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted in 2017; however we do not plan to adopt the standard early. Entities will have the option to apply the standard using a full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption method. The Company has not yet selected a transition method. The Company has a team in place to analyze the impact of Update 2014-09, and the related ASU's, across all revenue streams to evaluate the impact of the new standard on revenue contracts. This includes reviewing current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements under the new standard. Our evaluation of the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures is ongoing and not complete. The Company is continuing our review of contracts relative to the provisions of Topic 606. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)." This standard requires, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company expects to adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2019 and is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In connection with our assessment work, The Company has a team in place to analyze the impact of ASU 2016-02 and is continuing a review of our contracts relative to the provisions of the lease standard. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." This standard is intended to reduce existing diversity in practice in how certain transactions are presented on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is permitted. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-15 in the first quarter of 2017 and has determined the amendment does not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. Management believes the impact of other recently issued standards and updates, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows upon adoption. Note 3 Segment Reporting The Company's three reporting segments are crude oil marketing, tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals and dry bulk, and oil and gas exploration and production. Information concerning the Company's various business activities is summarized as follows (in thousands): 14 - Three Month Comparison Segment operating earnings reflect revenues net of operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization and are reconciled to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as follows (in thousands): Identifiable assets by industry segment are as follows (in thousands) : Intersegment sales are insignificant and all sales occurred in the United States. Other identifiable assets are primarily corporate cash, corporate accounts receivable, investments and properties not identified with any specific segment of the Company's business. Accounting policies for transactions between reportable segments are consistent with applicable accounting policies as disclosed herein. 15 Note 4 - Transactions with Affiliates The late Mr. K. S. Adams, Jr., former Chairman of the Board of the Company, and certain of his family partnerships and affiliates have participated as working interest owners with the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Adams Resources Exploration Corporation ( AREC") Mr. Adams and the affiliates participated on terms similar to those afforded other non-affiliated working interest owners. While the affiliates have generally maintained their existing property interest, they have not participated in any such transactions originating after the death of Mr. Adams in October 2013. In connection with the operation of certain oil and gas properties, the Company also charges such related parties for administrative overhead primarily as prescribed by the Council of Petroleum Accountants Society Bulletin 5. The Company also enters into certain transactions in the normal course of business with other affiliated entities including direct cost reimbursement for shared phone and administrative services. In addition, the Company leases office space from an affiliated entity based on a lease rental rate determined by an independent appraisal. The Company utilizes its former affiliate, Bencap, to administer certain of its employee medical benefit programs including a detail audit of individual medical claims. See Note (1) to the accompanying financials under the caption "Investments" for further discussion. Bencap earns a fee from the Company for providing such services at a discounted amount from its standard charge to non-affiliates. In February 2017, Bencap requested additional funding of approximately $0.5 million and the Company declined the additional funding request, resulting in forfeiture of the investment. Activities with affiliates were as follows (in thousands): Note 5 - Commitments and Contingencies Under the Company's automobile and workers' compensation insurance policies, the Company can either receive a return of premium paid or be assessed for additional premiums up to pre-established limits. Additionally, in certain instances the risk of insured losses is shared with a group of similarly situated entities. The Company has appropriately recognized estimated expenses and liabilities related to these policies for losses incurred but not reported to the Company or its insurance carrier as follows (in thousands): The Company maintains a self-insurance program for managing employee medical claims. A liability for expected claims incurred but not reported is established on a monthly basis. As claims are paid, the liability is relieved. The Company also maintains third party insurance stop-loss coverage for aggregate medical claims exceeding $4.5 million. Medical accrual amounts are as follows (in thousands): 16 Adams Resources Exploration Corporation ("AREC") is named as a defendant in a number of Louisiana lawsuits involving alleged environmental contamination from prior drilling operations. Such suits typically allege improper disposal of oilfield wastes in earthen pits, with one matter involving allegations that drilling operations in 1986 contributed to the formation of a sinkhole in 2012 (the "Sinkhole Cases"). The Sinkhole Cases, while arising from a singular event, include a number of different lawsuits brought in Louisiana State Court and one consolidated action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition to the Sinkhole Cases, AREC is currently involved in two other such suits. These suits are styled LePetit Chateau Deluxe v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation dated March 2004, and Henning Management, LLC v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation dated November 2013. Each suit involves multiple industry defendants with substantially larger proportional interest in the properties. In addition, the Sinkhole Cases involve a number of defendants in the solution mining industry, in which AREC has never participated. In the LePetit Chateau Deluxe matter, all the larger defendants have settled the case. The plaintiffs in each of these matters are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. While management does not believe that a material adverse effect on the Company will result from the claims, significant attorney fees may be incurred by AREC to address claims related to these suits. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company has accrued $0.5 million of future legal/or settlement costs for these matters. From time to time as incidental to its operations, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and/or disputes. Primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet, the Company is a party to motor vehicle accidents, worker compensation claims and other items of general liability as would be typical for the industry. Management of the Company is presently unaware of any claims against the Company that are either outside the scope of insurance coverage or that may exceed the level of insurance coverage and could potentially represent a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. Note 6 Subsequent Event On April 21, 2017 AREC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Case Number 17-10866(KG). AREC will continue to operate its business as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. As of March 31, 2017, the estimated net realizable value of the oil and gas assets is anticipated to be greater than the net book value. The Company will continue to evaluate the estimated net realizable value until the sale process has concluded. Adams Resources &amp; Energy, Inc. is the primary creditor in the Chapter 11 process. On May 3, 2017, AREC filed a Motion with the Bankruptcy Court for approval of an auction process and engagement of Oil &amp; Gas Asset Clearinghouse to conduct the auction. Over the past few years, the Company has de-emphasized its upstream operations and does not expect this Chapter 11 filing by its subsidiary to have a material adverse impact on any of its core businesses. 17 Item 2 . MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations - Marketing Marketing segment revenues, operating earnings, depreciation and certain costs were as follows ( in thousands ): _________________________________ (1) Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year. Crude oil marketing revenues increased in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of an increase in the market price for crude oil. The increase in crude oil prices offset the decline in marketing volumes. Operating earnings were adversely affected by the volume declines, inventory valuation changes as well as a narrowing of margins during the first quarter of 2017. Toward the end of the first quarter of 2017 we began to see an uplift in volumes as activity in our marketing areas has increased in recent months. Driver commissions are reduced due to the decline in volumes. Insurance costs are lower as a result of favorable safety performance. Fuel costs are lower consistent with reduced marketing volumes as compared to the first quarter of 2016. Supplemental volume and price information is as follows: _____________________________ (1) Reflects the volume purchased from third parties at the oil and natural gas field level and pipeline pooling points. Crude Oil Field Level Operating Earnings (Non GAAP-Measure) (1) Two significant factors affecting comparative crude oil marketing segment operating earnings are inventory valuations and forward commodity contract (derivatives or mark-to-market) valuations. As a purchaser and shipper of crude oil, the Company holds inventory in storage tanks and third-party pipelines. During periods of increasing crude oil prices, the Company recognizes inventory liquidation gains while during periods of falling prices, the Company recognizes inventory valuation losses. 18 Crude oil marketing operating earnings are also affected by the valuations of the Company's forward month commodity contracts (derivative instruments) as of the various report dates. Such non-cash valuations are calculated and recorded at each period end based on the underlying data existing as of such date. The Company generally enters into these derivative contracts as part of a pricing strategy based on crude oil purchases at the wellhead (field level). Only those contracts qualifying as derivative instruments are accorded fair value treatment while the companion contracts to purchase crude oil at the wellhead (field level) are not accorded fair value treatment. The valuation of derivative instruments at period end requires the recognition of mark-to-market" gains and losses. The impact on crude oil segment operating earnings of inventory liquidations and derivative valuations is summarized as follows in reconciling from the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures (in thousands): ____________________________________ (1) Such designation is (a) unique to the Company, (b) not a substitute for GAAP and (c) not comparable to any similar measures developed by industry participants. The Company utilizes such data to evaluate the profitability of its operations. The Company held crude oil inventory at a weighted average commodity price in barrels as follows: Field level operating earnings and field level purchase volumes (see earlier table) depict the Company's day-to-day operation of acquiring crude oil at the wellhead, transporting the material, and delivery to market at the sales point. Comparative field level operating earnings decreased during the first quarter of 2017 relative to the first quarter of 2016 due to reduced purchase volumes and reduced unit margins. Competition has remained strong, but we are beginning to see an uplift in volumes as activity in our marketing areas has increased in recent months. Historically, prices received for crude oil have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue. See "Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2016. 19 - Transportation Transportation segment revenues, earnings and depreciation are as follows ( in thousands ): __________________________ (1) Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year. The Company's revenue rate structure includes a component for fuel costs such that fuel cost fluctuations are largely passed through to the customer over time. To illustrate, a calculation of revenues net of fuel cost is presented below (in thousands): __________________________ (1) Revenues net of fuel is a non-GAAP measure and utilized for internal analysis. Revenues net of fuel are reduced in the first quarter of 2017 because of competition within the transportation segment. The Company began to see an uptick in activity toward the end of the first quarter of 2017 and continues to work on its strategy of streamlining operations and diversifying offerings in the transportation segment. - Oil and Gas Oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings (loss) are primarily a function of crude oil and natural gas prices and volumes. Comparative amounts for revenues, operating earnings and depreciation and depletion are as follows (in thousands): 20 ________________________________ (1) Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year. Oil and gas revenues and operating earnings increased in the comparative first quarter of 2017 as commodity price increases offset production declines. Volumes declined consistent with reduced drilling activity. Depreciation and depletion expense is calculated on a units of production basis and is lower primarily due to a reduction in production volumes. Production volumes and price information is as follows: - General and administrative General and administrative expenses increased from $2.2 million during the first quarter of 2016 to $2.6 million during the first quarter of 2017 due to utilization of outside consultants as the Company conducted its review of strategic alternatives for the oil and gas exploration and production subsidiary. - Investments In December 2015 the Company formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, Adams Resources Medical Management, Inc. (ARMM), and in January 2016 ARMM acquired a 30% member interest in Bencap LLC (Bencap) for a $2.2 million cash payment. Bencap provides medical insurance brokerage and medical claims auditing services to employers utilizing ERISA governed employee benefit plans. The Company has accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting. 21 During the third quarter of 2016, the Company completed a review of its equity method investment in Bencap and determined there was an other than temporary impairment. Underlying this decision are the terms of the investment agreement where Bencap has the option to request borrowings up to $1.5 million (on or after December 5, 2016 but before October 31, 2018) that the Company must provide or forfeit its 30% member interest. During the third quarter of 2016, management of the Company determined that it was unlikely to provide additional funding due to Bencap's lower than projected revenue growth and operating losses since investment inception. As a result, the Company recognized a net loss of $1.4 million from its investment in Bencap as of September 30, 2016. This loss included a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.7 million and pre-tax losses from the equity method investment of $0.5 million. In February 2017, Bencap requested additional funding of approximately $0.5 million and the Company declined the additional funding request and forfeited its 30% member interest in BenCap. In April 2016 the Company, through its ARMM subsidiary, acquired an approximate 15% equity interest (less than 3% voting interest) in VestaCare, Inc., a California corporation ("VestaCare"), for a $2.5 million cash payment. VestaCare provides an array of software as a service ("SaaS") electronic payment technologies to medical providers, payers and patients including VestaCare's most recent product offering, VestaPay . VestaPay allows medical care providers to structure fully automated and dynamically updating electronic payment plans for their patients. The Company has accounted for this investment under the cost method of accounting for investments. The Company does not currently have any plans to pursue additional medical-related investments. Outlook The Company plans to operate its segments with internally generated cash flows during 2017, but plans to remain flexible as the focus will be on business development opportunities. During 2017, the Company plans to leverage its investment in the transportation segment's Houston terminal with the continued efforts to diversify service offerings, grow in new or existing areas with its marketing segment and complete the exit of the upstream oil and gas business. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's liquidity derives from net cash provided by operating activities and is therefore dependent on the success of future operations. The most significant source of liquidity is the cash yield from net earnings factoring in the non-cash book expense items for depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairments. The Company has no debt and funds all of its projects from this stream of cash. In most periods, cash inflows equal or exceed capital spending outflows. Should cash inflow subside or turn negative, the Company will curtail its capital spending accordingly. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had no bank debt or other forms of debenture obligations. Cash balances are maintained in order to meet the timing of day-to-day cash needs and such amounts and working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, were as follows (in thousands): 22 Cash provided from operating activities was as follows (in thousands): At various times each month, the Company makes cash prepayments and/or early payments in advance of the normal due date to certain suppliers of crude oil within the marketing operations. Crude oil supply prepayments are recouped and advanced from month to month as the suppliers deliver product to the Company. In addition, in order to secure crude oil supply, the Company may also early pay" its suppliers in advance of the normal payment due date of the twentieth of the month following the month of production. Such early payments" reduce cash and accounts payable as of the balance sheet date. The Company also requires certain customers to make similar early payments or to post cash collateral with the Company in order to support their purchases from the Company. Early payments and cash collateral received from customers increases cash and reduces accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date. The Company relies heavily on its ability to obtain open-line trade credit from its suppliers especially with respect to its crude oil marketing operation. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company elected to make several early payments in its crude oil marketing. The Company's cash balance increased by approximately $12 million as of March 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016 as the year end 2016 balance was slightly lower than normal as a result of early payments made during the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company maintains a stand-by letter of credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank to provide for the issuance of up to $60 million in stand-by letters of credit for the benefit of suppliers of crude oil. Stand-by letters of credit are issued as needed and are cancelled as the underlying purchase obligations are satisfied by cash payment when due. The issuance of stand-by letters of credit enables the Company to avoid posting cash collateral when procuring crude oil supply. Early payments, collateral and letters of credit amounts were as follows (in thousands): Management believes current cash balances, together with expected cash generated from future operations, and the ease of financing truck and trailer additions through leasing arrangements (should the need arise) will be sufficient to meet short-term and long-term liquidity needs. The Company utilizes cash from operations to make discretionary investments in its marketing, transportation and exploration businesses. With the exception of commitments totaling approximately $7.2 million associated with barge affreightment contracts, storage tank terminal arrangements and office lease space, the Company's future commitments and planned investments can be readily curtailed if operating cash flows contract. 23 Capital project spending through the first three months of 2017 is as follows (in thousands): A quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share or $928,000 was paid during each of the first quarters of 2017 and 2016. The most significant item affecting future increases or decreases in liquidity is earnings from operations and such earnings are dependent on the success of future operations. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates There have been no material changes to the Company's Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates" disclosures that have occurred since the disclosures provided in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Item 1.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation Organization Adams Resources & Energy, Inc. ("AE"), a Delaware corporation organized in 1973, and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the business of crude oil marketing, tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals and dry bulk, and oil and gas exploration and production. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to "we," "us," "our," the "Company" or "AE" are intended to mean the business and operations of Adams Resources & Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We operate and report in three business segments: (i) crude oil marketing, (ii) tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals and dry bulk, and (iii) oil and gas exploration and production. We expect to exit the oil and gas exploration and production business later this year. On April 21, 2017, Adams Resources Exploration Corporation ("AREC"), our wholly owned subsidiary, filed a voluntary petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court") seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"), Case No. 17-10866 (KG). AREC continues to operate its business and manage its properties as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and order of the Bankruptcy Court. AE is the primary creditor in the Chapter 11 process. Over the past few years, we have de-emphasized our upstream operations and do not expect this Chapter 11 filing by AREC to have a material adverse impact on any of our core businesses. On May 3, 2017, AREC filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court for approval of an auction process and engagement of Oil & Gas Asset Clearinghouse to conduct the auction. The auction commenced on July 19, 2017 to determine the highest or otherwise best bid to acquire all or substantially all of AREC's assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the voluntary bankruptcy filing in April 2017 by AREC, we no longer control the operations of AREC; therefore, we deconsolidated AREC effective with the bankruptcy filing and recorded our investment in AREC under the cost method. See Note 3 for further information. Basis of Presentation Our results of operations for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of results expected for the full year of 2017 . In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals necessary for fair presentation.The condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial statements and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Certain information and footnote disclosures required by GAAP for complete annual financial statements have been omitted and, therefore, these interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2016 (the " 2016 Form 10-K") filed with the SEC on March 31, 2017. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made in the prior year's financial statements to conform to classifications used in the current year. Losses from equity investments has been classified as a component of other income (expense), net, with its tax effect included in the income tax benefit. 6 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Use of Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the operating environment changes. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. Note 2. General Accounting and Disclosure Matters Fair Value Measurements The carrying amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. Marketable securities are recorded at fair value based on market quotations from actively traded liquid markets. A three-tier hierarchy has been established that classifies fair value amounts recognized in the financial statements based on the observability of inputs used to estimate such fair values.The hierarchy considers fair value amounts based on observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) to be more reliable and predictable than those based primarily on unobservable inputs (Level 3).At each balance sheet reporting date, we categorize our financial assets and liabilities using this hierarchy. Fair value contracts consist of derivative financial instruments and are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for, and we elect, cash flow hedge accounting. We had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during any current reporting periods. See Note 7 for further information. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates Bencap . We owned a 30% member interest in Bencap LLC ("Bencap"). Bencap provides medical insurance brokerage and medical claims auditing services to employers utilizing ERISA governed employee benefit plans. We accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting. Underlying the terms of the investment agreement, Bencap had the option to request borrowings from us of up to $1.5 million (on or after December 5, 2016 but before October 31, 2018) that we were required to provide or forfeit our 30% member interest. During 2016 , our management determined that we were unlikely to provide additional funding due to Bencap's lower than projected revenue growth and operating losses since investment inception. During 2016 , we recognized a net loss of $1.4 million to write-off our investment in Bencap during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, which included a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.7 million and pre-tax losses from the equity method investment of $0.5 million . In February 2017, Bencap requested additional funding of approximately $0.5 million . We declined the additional funding request and forfeited our 30% member interest in Bencap. At June30, 2017 , we have no further ownership interest in Bencap. We currently do not have any plans to pursue additional medical-related investments. VestaCare . We own an approximate 15% equity interest (less than 3% voting interest) in VestaCare, Inc., a California corporation ("VestaCare"). VestaCare provides an array of software as a service ("SaaS") electronic payment technologies to medical providers, payers and patients including VestaCare's most recent product offering, VestaPay . VestaPay allows medical care providers to structure fully automated and dynamically updating electronic payment plans for their patients. We account for this investment under the cost method of accounting. 7 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AREC . As a result of the voluntary bankruptcy filing in April 2017 and our loss of control of AREC, we deconsolidated AREC effective with the bankruptcy filing and we now record our investment in AREC under the cost method. See Note 3 for further information. Letter of Credit Facility We maintain a Credit and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank to provide up to a $60 million stand-by letter of credit facility used to support crude oil purchases within our crude oil marketing segment. This facility is collateralized by the eligible accounts receivable within the crude oil marketing segment. The issued stand-by letters of credit are canceled as the underlying purchase obligations are satisfied by cash payment when due. The letter of credit facility places certain restrictions on Gulfmark Energy, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary. Such restrictions include the maintenance of a combined 1.1 to 1.0 current ratio and the maintenance of positive net earnings excluding inventory valuation changes, as defined, among other restrictions. We are currently in compliance with all such financial covenants. No letter of credit amounts were outstanding at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The letter of credit facility expires on August 31, 2017, and we anticipate renewing the facility for another one-year term. Prepayments and Other Current Assets The components of prepayments and other current assets are as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands): Property and Equipment We capitalize expenditures for major renewals and betterments, and we expense expenditures for maintenance and repairs as incurred. We capitalize interest costs incurred in connection with major capital expenditures and amortize these costs over the lives of the related assets. When properties are retired or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization is removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings. We account for oil and gas exploration and development expenditures in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting. We capitalize direct costs of acquiring developed or undeveloped leasehold acreage, including lease bonus, brokerage and other fees. We initially capitalize exploratory drilling costs until the properties are evaluated and determined to be either productive or nonproductive. Such evaluations are made on a quarterly basis. If an exploratory well is determined to be nonproductive, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense. Costs incurred to drill and complete development wells, including dry holes, are capitalized. As of June30, 2017 , we had no unevaluated or suspended exploratory drilling costs. Effective in April 2017, our oil and gas subsidiary was deconsolidated and is now accounted for as a cost method investment, as a result of its bankruptcy filing (see Note 3). We calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties using the units-of-production method. The reserve base or denominator used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. For lease and well equipment, development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. The numerator for such calculations is actual production volumes for the period. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated average useful lives of three to twenty years. 8 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever there is evidence that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Any impairment recognized is permanent and may not be restored. Property and equipment is reviewed at the lowest level of indentifiable cash flows. Producing oil and gas properties are reviewed on a field-by-field basis. Fields with carrying values in excess of their estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are deemed impaired. For properties requiring impairment, the fair value is estimated based on an internal discounted cash flow model. Cash flows are developed based on estimated future production and prices are then discounted using a market based rate of return consistent with that used by us in evaluating cash flows for other assets of a similar nature. On a quarterly basis, our management evaluates the carrying value of non-producing oil and gas leasehold properties and may deem them impaired based on remaining lease term, area drilling activity and our plans for the property. This fair value measure depends highly on our assessment of the likelihood of continued exploration efforts in a given area. Therefore, such data inputs are categorized as "unobservable" or "Level 3" inputs (see Note 7). Impairment provisions included in our oil and gas segment operating losses were not material during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. Since we are no longer the operator of our oil and gas property interests, we do not maintain the underlying detail acreage data and we are dependent on the operator when determining which specific acreage will ultimately be drilled. However, the capitalized cost detail on a property-by-property basis is reviewed by management, and deemed impaired if development is not anticipated prior to lease expiration. Onshore leasehold periods are normally three years and may contain renewal options. Revenue Recognition Certain commodity purchase and sale contracts utilized by our crude oil marketing business qualify as derivative instruments with certain specifically identified contracts also designated as trading activity. From the time of contract origination, such trading activity contracts are marked-to-market and recorded on a net revenue basis in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Most crude oil purchase and sale contracts qualify and are designated as non-trading activities, and we consider such contracts as normal purchases and sales activity. For normal purchases and sales, our customers are invoiced monthly based upon contractually agreed upon terms with revenue recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer. Such sales are recorded on a gross basis in the financial statements because we take title, have risk of loss for the products, are the primary obligor for the purchase, establish the sale price independently with a third party and maintain credit risk associated with the sale of the product. Certain crude oil contracts may be with a single counterparty to provide for similar quantities of crude oil to be bought and sold at different locations. These contracts are entered into for a variety of reasons, including effecting the transportation of the commodity, to minimize credit exposure, and/or to meet the competitive demands of the customer. Such buy/sell arrangements are reflected on a net revenue basis in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Reporting such crude oil contracts on a gross revenue basis would increase our reported revenues as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands): Transportation segment customers are invoiced, and the related revenue is recognized as the service is provided. Oil and gas revenue from our interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and gas passes to the purchaser. 9 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Recent Accounting Developments Revenue Recognition . In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"). The new accounting standard, along with its related amendments, replaces the current rules-based U.S. GAAP governing revenue recognition with a principles-based approach. We plan to adopt the new standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach, which requires us to apply the new revenue standard to (i) all new revenue contracts entered into after January 1, 2018 and (ii) all existing revenue contracts as of January 1, 2018 through a cumulative adjustment to equity.In accordance with this approach, our consolidated revenues for periods prior to January 1, 2018 will not be revised. The core principle in the new guidance is that a company should recognize revenue in a manner that fairly depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration the company expects to receive for those goods or services.In order to apply this core principle, companies will apply the following five steps in determining the amount of revenues to recognize: (i) identify the contract; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Each of these steps involves management's judgment and an analysis of the contract's material terms and conditions. Our implementation activities related to ASC 606 are ongoing. We do not anticipate that there will be material differences in the amount or timing of revenues recognized following the new standard's adoption date. Although total consolidated revenues may not be materially impacted by the new guidance, we do anticipate significant changes to our disclosures based on the additional requirements prescribed by ASC 606. These new disclosures include information regarding the significant judgments used in evaluating when and how revenue is (or will be) recognized and data related to contract assets and liabilities. Additionally, we are currently evaluating our business processes, systems and controls to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of the recognition and disclosure requirements under the new revenue guidance. Leases . In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842, Leases ("ASC 842"), which requires substantially all leases (with the exception of leases with a term of one year or less) to be recorded on the balance sheet using a method referred to as the right-of-use ("ROU") asset approach. We plan to adopt the new standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method described within ASC 842. The new standard introduces two lease accounting models, which result in a lease being classified as either a "finance" or "operating" lease on the basis of whether the lessee effectively obtains control of the underlying asset during the lease term. A lease would be classified as a finance lease if it meets one of five classification criteria, four of which are generally consistent with current lease accounting guidance. By default, a lease that does not meet the criteria to be classified as a finance lease will be deemed an operating lease. Regardless of classification, the initial measurement of both lease types will result in the balance sheet recognition of a ROU asset representing a company's right to use the underlying asset for a specified period of time and a corresponding lease liability. The lease liability will be recognized at the present value of the future lease payments, and the ROU asset will equal the lease liability adjusted for any prepaid rent, lease incentives provided by the lessor, and any indirect costs. The subsequent measurement of each type of lease varies. Leases classified as a finance lease will be accounted for using the effective interest method. Under this approach, a lessee will amortize the ROU asset (generally on a straight-line basis in a manner similar to depreciation) and the discount on the lease liability (as a component of interest expense). Leases classified as an operating lease will result in the recognition of a single lease expense amount that is recorded on a straight-line basis (or another systematic basis, if more appropriate). We are in the process of reviewing our lease agreements in light of the new guidance. Although we are in the early stages of our ASC 842 implementation project, we anticipate that this new lease guidance will cause significant changes to the way leases are recorded, presented and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. 10 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 3. Subsidiary Bankruptcy and Deconsolidation Bankruptcy Filing and Deconsolidation As a result of AREC's bankruptcy filing in April 2017, AE has ceded its authority to the Bankruptcy Court, and AE management cannot carry on AREC activities in the ordinary course of business without Bankruptcy Court approval. AE manages the day-to-day operations of AREC, but does not have discretion to make significant capital or operating budgetary changes or decisions and purchase or sell significant assets, as AREC's material decisions are subject to review by the Bankruptcy Court. For these reasons, we have concluded that AE has lost control of AREC, and no longer has significant influence over AREC during the pendency of the bankruptcy. Therefore, we deconsolidated AREC effective with the filing of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2017. In order to deconsolidate AREC, the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of AREC were removed from our consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2017, and we recorded our investment in AREC at its estimated fair value of approximately $5.0 million . We determined the fair value of our investment based upon bids we received in the auction process and determined that the estimated fair value of our investment in AREC was expected to be lower than its net book value immediately prior to the deconsolidation. As a result, at June 30, 2017, we recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $1.6 million associated with the deconsolidation of AREC, which reflects the excess of the net assets of AREC over its estimated fair value based on the expected sales transaction price of approximately $5.0 million . Subsequent to the deconsolidation of AREC, we are accounting for our investment in AREC using the cost method of accounting because AE does not exercise significant influence over the operations of AREC due to the Chapter 11 filing. On August 1, 2017, a hearing was held before the Bankruptcy Court seeking approval of asset purchase agreements with two unaffiliated parties to purchase AREC's oil and gas assets for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $5.0 million . The Bankruptcy Court approved the asset purchase agreements, we are currently negotiating the assets purchase agreements. DIP Financing Related Party Relationship In connection with the bankruptcy filing, AREC entered into a Debtor in Possession Credit and Security Agreement with AE ("DIP Credit Agreement") dated as of April 25, 2017, in an aggregate amount of up to $1.25 million , of which the funds are to be used by AREC solely to fund operations through August 11, 2017. Loans under the DIP Credit Agreement accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.0% per annum and are due and payable upon the earlier of (a) twelve months after the petition date, (b) the closing of the sale of substantially all of AREC's assets, (c) the effective date of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization of AREC, and (d) the date that the DIP loan is accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default, as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement. At June 30, 2017, approximately $0.4 million was outstanding under the DIP Credit Agreement and was included in accounts receivable, related party on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. 11 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 4. Cash Deposits and Other Assets Components of cash deposits and other assets were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands): We have established certain deposits to support participation in our liability insurance program and remittance of state crude oil severance taxes and other state collateral deposits. Insurance collateral deposits are invested at the discretion of our insurance carrier and such investments primarily consist of intermediate term federal government bonds, corporate bonds and bonds backed by federal agencies. This fair value measure relies on inputs from quoted prices for similar assets and is thus categorized as a "Level 2" valuation in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 7 for further information. 12 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 5. Segment Reporting Our three reporting segments are (i) crude oil marketing, (ii) tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals and dry bulk, and (iii) oil and gas exploration and production. Our oil and gas exploration and production segment filed for bankruptcy in April 2017 (see Note 3), and as a result of the loss of control, was deconsolidated and is being accounted for under the cost method. AREC remained a reportable segment until its deconsolidation, effective April 30, 2017. Information concerning our various business activities is summarized as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands): 13 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Segment operating earnings reflect revenues net of operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization and are reconciled to earnings (losses) before income taxes, as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands): Identifiable assets by industry segment were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands): _________________ (1) At June 30, 2017, amount represents our cost method investment in this segment. Intersegment sales are insignificant and all sales occurred in the United States. Other identifiable assets are primarily corporate cash, corporate accounts receivable, investments and properties not identified with any specific segment of our business. Accounting policies for transactions between reportable segments are consistent with applicable accounting policies as disclosed herein. Note 6. Transactions with Affiliates The late Mr. K. S. Adams, Jr., former Chairman of the Board, and certain of his family partnerships and affiliates have participated as working interest owners with AREC. Mr. Adams and the affiliates participated on terms similar to those afforded other non-affiliated working interest owners. While these affiliates have generally maintained their existing property interest, they have not participated in any such transactions originating after the death of Mr. Adams in October 2013. In connection with the operation of certain oil and gas properties, we also charge such related parties for administrative overhead primarily as prescribed by the Council of Petroleum Accountants Society Bulletin 5. We also enter into certain transactions in the normal course of business with other affiliated entities including direct cost reimbursement for shared phone and administrative services. In addition, we lease our corporate office space from an affiliated entity. 14 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We utilize our former affiliate, Bencap, to administer certain of our employee medical benefit programs including a detail audit of individual medical claims. See Note 2 for further discussion. Bencap earns a fee from us for providing such services at a discounted amount from its standard charge to non-affiliates. In February 2017, Bencap requested additional funding of approximately $0.5 million from us. We declined the additional funding request and forfeited our 30% member interest in Bencap. At June 30, 2017, we have no further ownership interest in Bencap. Activities with affiliates were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands): ___________________ (1) Amount represents fees paid to Bencap through the forfeiture of our investment during the first quarter of 2017. As a result of the investment forfeiture, Bencap is no longer an affiliate. DIP Financing In connection with its voluntary bankruptcy filing, AREC entered into a DIP Credit Agreement with AE. At June 30, 2017, approximately $0.4 million was outstanding under the DIP Credit Agreement. We earned interest income of approximately $0.1 million under the DIP Credit Agreement through June 30, 2017. See Note 3 for further discussion. Note 7. Derivative Instruments and Fair Value Measurements Derivative Instruments Our crude oil marketing segment is involved in the purchase and sale of crude oil. We seek to profit by procuring the commodity as it is produced and then delivering the material to the end users or the intermediate use marketplace. As typical for the industry, such transactions are made pursuant to the terms of forward month commodity purchase and/or sale contracts. Some of these contracts meet the definition of a derivative instrument, and therefore, we account for such contracts at fair value, unless the normal purchase and sale exception is applicable. Such underlying contracts are standard for the industry and are the governing document for our crude oil marketing segment. None of our derivative instruments have been designated as hedging instruments. 15 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The estimated fair value of forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet were as follows at the date indicated (in thousands): As of June30, 2017 , our derivative valuations were comprised of eight commodity purchase and sale contracts. These contracts encompassed approximately 97 barrels per day of crude oil during July 2017 through October 2017, 65 barrels per day of crude oil during November 2017 through January 2018 and 145,000 barrels of crude oil during July 2017 through August 2017. Forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet were as follows at the date indicated (in thousands): As of December31, 2016 , our derivative valuations were comprised of two commodity purchase and sale contracts. These contracts encompassed approximately 65 barrels per day of diesel fuel during January through March 2017 and 145,000 barrels of crude oil during January 2017 through April 2017. We only enter into commodity contracts with creditworthy counterparties and evaluate our exposure to significant counterparties on an ongoing basis. As of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 , we were not holding nor have we posted any collateral to support our forward month fair value derivative activity. We are not subject to any credit-risk related trigger events. We have no other financial investment arrangements that would serve to offset our derivative contracts. 16 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Forward month commodity contracts (derivatives) reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements The following tables set forth, by level with the Level 1, 2 and 3 fair value hierarchy, the carrying values of our financial assets and liabilities at the dates indicated (in thousands): These assets and liabilities are measured on a recurring basis and are classified based on the lowest level of input used to estimate their fair value. Our assessment of the relative significance of such inputs requires judgments. When determining fair value measurements, we make credit valuation adjustments to reflect both our own nonperformance risk and our counterparty's nonperformance risk. When adjusting the fair value of derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we consider the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements. Credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as credit scores to evaluate the likelihood of default by us or our counterparties. As of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 , credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our fair value contracts. As a result, applicable fair value assets and liabilities are included in their entirety in the fair value hierarchy. 17 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements Certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. The following table presents categories of long-lived assets that were subject to non-recurring fair value measurements during thesix months ended June 30, 2017 (in thousands): ________________ (1) The estimated fair value is based on Bankruptcy Court approved bids for assets. See Note 3 for further information. Note 8. Supplemental Cash Flow Information Supplemental cash flows and non-cash transactions were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands): Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies Insurance Policies Under our automobile and workers' compensation insurance policies, we can either receive a return of premium paid or be assessed for additional premiums up to pre-established limits. Additionally, in certain instances the risk of insured losses is shared with a group of similarly situated entities. We have appropriately recognized estimated expenses and liabilities related to these policies for losses incurred but not reported to us or our insurance carrier as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands): 18 ADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We maintain a self-insurance program for managing employee medical claims. A liability for expected claims incurred but not reported is established on a monthly basis. As claims are paid, the liability is relieved. We also maintain third party insurance stop-loss coverage for annual aggregate medical claims exceeding $4.5 million . Medical accrual amounts were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands): Litigation AREC is named as a defendant in a number of Louisiana lawsuits involving alleged environmental contamination from prior drilling operations. Such suits typically allege improper disposal of oilfield wastes in earthen pits, with one matter involving allegations that drilling operations in 1986 contributed to the formation of a sinkhole in 2012 (the "Sinkhole Cases"). The Sinkhole Cases, while arising from a singular event, include a number of different lawsuits brought in Louisiana State Court and one consolidated action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition to the Sinkhole Cases, AREC is also currently involved in two other suits. These suits are styled LePetit Chateau Deluxe v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation dated March 2004 and Henning Management, LLC v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation dated November 2013. Each suit involves multiple industry defendants with substantially larger proportional interest in the properties. In the LePetit Chateau Deluxe matter, all the larger defendants have settled the case. The plaintiffs in each of these matters are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. While we do not believe that these claims will result in a material adverse effect on us, significant attorney fees may be incurred to address claims related to these suits. As of December31, 2016 , we had $0.5 million accrued of future legal costs for these matters. During May 2017, AREC was dismissed without prejudice as a party to the suit with Henning Management. Management also determined that the likelihood of future claims from other remaining litigation was remote. As such, we reversed the $0.5 million accrual for future legal settlements related to these matters. As of June30, 2017 , we had no remaining accruals for legal costs for these matters. From time to time as incidental to its operations, we may become involved in various lawsuits and/or disputes. Primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet, we are a party to motor vehicle accidents, worker compensation claims and other items of general liability as would be typical for the industry. We are presently unaware of any claims against us that are either outside the scope of insurance coverage or that may exceed the level of insurance coverage and could potentially represent a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 19 Item 2 .

Overview of Business Adams Resources & Energy, Inc. ("AE"), a Delaware corporation organized in 1973, and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the business of crude oil marketing, tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals and dry bulk, and oil and gas exploration and production. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to "we," "us," "our," the "Company" or "AE" are intended to mean the business and operations of Adams Resources & Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We operate and report in three business segments: (i) crude oil marketing, (ii) tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals and dry bulk, and (iii) oil and gas exploration and production. We expect to exit the oil and gas exploration and production business later this year. Recent Developments On April 21, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary, Adams Resources Exploration Corporation ("AREC"), filed a voluntary petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court") seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"), Case No. 17-10866 (KG). AREC continues to operate its business and manage its properties as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and order of the Bankruptcy Court. AE is the primary creditor in the Chapter 11 process. At June 30, 2017, we recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $1.6 million associated with the deconsolidation of AREC, which reflects the excess of the net assets of AREC over its estimated fair value based on an expected sales transaction price of approximately $5.0 million. 20 In connection with the bankruptcy filing, AREC entered into a DIP Credit Agreement with AE. At June 30, 2017, approximately $0.4 million was outstanding under the DIP Credit Agreement. See Note 3 in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Results of Operations Marketing Our crude oil marketing segment revenues, operating earnings and selected costs were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands): _________________________________ (1) Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year periods. Supplemental volume and price information was as follows for the periods indicated: _____________________________ (1) Reflects the volume purchased from third parties at the field level of operations. Crude oil marketing revenues increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 primarily as a result of an increase in the market price of crude oil. The increase in crude oil prices during 2017 has offset the decline in crude oil marketing volumes during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the same periods in 2016. Our marketing operating earnings were adversely affected by crude oil volume declines, inventory valuation changes as well as a narrowing of margins during the 2017 period. By the end of June 2017, we began to see an increase in volumes as activity in our marketing areas has increased in recent months. Driver commissions decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the same periods in 2016 as a result of the decrease in crude oil marketing volumes. Insurance costs decreased as a result of favorable driver safety performance during 2017 as compared to the same periods in 2016. Fuel costs decreased consistent with decreased marketing volumes during 2017 as compared to the same periods in 2016. Field Level Operating Earnings (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) Inventory valuations and forward commodity contract (derivatives or mark-to-market) valuations are two significant factors affecting comparative crude oil marketing segment operating earnings. As a purchaser and shipper of crude oil, we hold inventory in storage tanks and third-party pipelines. Inventory sales turnover occurs approximately every three days, but the quantity held in stock at the end of a given period is reasonably consistent. During periods of increasing crude oil prices, we recognize inventory liquidation gains while during periods of falling prices, we recognize inventory liquidation and valuation losses. Crude oil marketing operating earnings are also affected by the valuations of our forward month commodity contracts (derivative instruments). These non-cash valuations are calculated and recorded at each period end based on the underlying data existing as of such date. We generally enter into these derivative contracts as part of a pricing strategy based on crude oil purchases at the wellhead (field level). Only those contracts qualifying as derivative instruments are accorded fair value treatment while the companion contracts to purchase crude oil at the wellhead (field level) are not subject to fair value treatment. The valuation of derivative instruments at period end requires the recognition of "mark-to-market" gains and losses. The impact of inventory liquidations and derivative valuations on our marketing segment operating earnings is summarized in the following reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated (in thousands): ____________________________________ (1) The use of field level operating earnings is (a) unique to us, (b) not a substitute for a GAAP measure and (c) not comparable to any similar measures developed by industry participants. We utilize such data to evaluate the profitability of our operations. We held crude oil inventory at a weighted average composite price in barrels as follows at the dates indicated: Field level operating earnings and field level purchase volumes (see above table) depict our day-to-day operation of acquiring crude oil at the wellhead, transporting the product, and delivering the product to market sales point. Field level operating earnings decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the same periods in 2016 due to reduced purchase volumes and reduced unit margins. Historically, prices received for crude oil have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue. See "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors " in our 2016 Form 10-K. 22 Transportation Transportation segment revenues, earnings, depreciation and other costs were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands): __________________________ (1) Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year periods. Our revenue rate structure includes a component for fuel costs in which fuel cost fluctuations are largely passed through to the customer over time. Revenues net of fuel cost were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands): __________________________ (1) Revenues net of fuel is a non-GAAP financial measure and is utilized for internal analysis of the results of our transportation segment. Revenues net of fuel decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 primarily as a result of increased competition within the transportation segment. We began to see an increase in transportation activity by the end of June 2017, and we continue to work on our strategy of streamlining operations and diversifying offerings in the transportation segment. 23 Oil and Gas Oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings (losses) are primarily a function of crude oil and natural gas prices and volumes. As a result of the bankruptcy filing in April 2017 and our loss of control of AREC, we deconsolidated AREC effective with the bankruptcy filing and recorded our investment in AREC under the cost method. Our results for the 2017 periods are only through April 30, 2017, during the period in which AREC as consolidated. Revenues, operating earnings and depreciation and depletion for our oil and gas segment were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands): ________________________________ (1) Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year periods. Revenues from our oil and gas segment decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 primarily as a result of the deconsolidation of this segment effective with its bankruptcy filing in April 2017 as well as production declines offsetting commodity price increases. Volumes declined as a result of the deconsoliation of AREC in April 2017 (four months of volumes in 2017 versus six months of volumes in 2016). Depreciation and depletion expense is calculated on a units-of-production basis and is lower primarily due to a reduction in production volumes. Supplemental volume and price information was as follows for the periods indicated (volumes in thousands): ________________________________ (1) Volumes for the 2017 periods are only through April 30, 2017 as a result of the deconsolidation of this subsidiary due to its bankruptcy filing. General and administrative General and administrative expenses decreased $0.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to the reversal of certain legal accruals related to legal matters, partially offset by higher legal fees. 24 General and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged when comparing the six months ended June 30, 2017 with the six months ended June 30, 2016, with the reversal of certain legal accruals related to legal matters offset by higher legal fees. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates During the second quarter of 2017, we deconsolidated AREC effective with the bankruptcy filing on April 21, 2017 and recorded our investment in AREC under the cost method. Based upon bids received in the auction process (see Note 3 in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information), we determined that the fair value of our investment in AREC was expected to be lower than its net book value immediately prior to the deconsolidation. As a result, at June 30, 2017, we recorded a non-cash charge of $1.6 million related to the deconsolidation of AREC, which reflects the excess of the net assets of AREC over its estimated fair value based on the expected sales transaction price. Outlook We plan to operate our remaining business segments with internally generated cash flows during 2017, but intend to remain flexible as the focus will be on business development opportunities. During 2017, we plan to leverage our investment in the transportation segment's Houston terminal with the continued efforts to diversify service offerings, grow in new or existing areas with our crude oil marketing segment and complete the exit of the upstream oil and gas business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Our liquidity is from our cash balance and net cash provided by operating activities and is therefore dependent on the success of future operations. If our cash inflow subsides or turns negative, we will evaluate our investment plan and remain flexible. Our wholly owned subsidiary, AREC, filed for bankruptcy in April 2017. Over the past few years, we have de-emphasized our upstream operations and do not expect this Chapter 11 filing by AREC to have a material adverse impact on any of our core businesses. In connection with the bankruptcy filing, AREC entered into a DIP Credit Agreement with AE. At June 30, 2017, approximately $0.4 million was outstanding under the DIP Credit Agreement. We are the primary creditor in AREC's Chapter 11 process. As a result of the auction process, we expect to sell our interest in AREC for approximately $5.0 million. We expect to close on the sales transaction in the third quarter of 2017. As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had no bank debt or other forms of debenture obligations. Cash balances are maintained in order to meet the timing of day-to-day cash needs and such amounts and working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands): We maintain a stand-by letter of credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank to provide for the issuance of up to $60million in stand-by letters of credit for the benefit of suppliers of crude oil. Stand-by letters of credit are issued as needed and are canceled as the underlying purchase obligations are satisfied by cash payment when due. The issuance of stand-by letters of credit enables us to avoid posting cash collateral when procuring crude oil supply. 25 Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities Our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands): At various times each month, we make cash prepayments and/or early payments in advance of the normal due date to certain suppliers of crude oil within our marketing operations. Crude oil supply prepayments are recouped and advanced from month to month as the suppliers deliver product to us. In addition, in order to secure crude oil supply, we may also "early pay" our suppliers in advance of the normal payment due date of the twentieth of the month following the month of production. Such "early payments" reduce cash and accounts payable as of the balance sheet date. We also require certain customers to make similar early payments or to post cash collateral with us in order to support their purchases from us. Early payments and cash collateral received from customers increases cash and reduces accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date. Early payments were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands): We rely heavily on our ability to obtain open-line trade credit from our suppliers especially with respect to our crude oil marketing operations. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we elected to make several early payments in our crude oil marketing operations. Our cash balance increased by approximately $16 million as of June 30, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016 as the year end 2016 balance was slightly lower than normal as a result of these early payments made during the fourth quarter of 2016. Management believes current cash balances, together with expected cash generated from future operations, and the ease of financing truck and trailer additions through leasing arrangements (should the need arise) will be sufficient to meet short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We utilize cash from operations to make discretionary investments in our marketing, transportation and oil and gas exploration businesses. With the exception of commitments totaling approximately $4.5 million associated with storage tank terminal arrangements and office lease space, our future commitments and planned investments can be readily curtailed if operating cash flows contract. 26 Capital spending was as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands): We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share, or $0.9 million, during each of the first and second quarters of 2017 and 2016. The most significant item affecting future increases or decreases in liquidity is earnings from operations, and such earnings are dependent on the success of future operations. See "Part I, Item 1A.
