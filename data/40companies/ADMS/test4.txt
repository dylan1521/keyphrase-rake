NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  1.DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the "Company") is a pharmaceutical company that discovers and develops chrono-synchronous therapies to improve the daily lives of people affected by chronic neurologic disorders. The Company pioneered a platform to develop medicines for chronic neurologic disorders based upon an understanding of time-dependent biologic processes responsible for disease activity and drug response. The Company calls these medicines chrono-synchronous therapies. The Company's portfolio includes:  ADS-5102 : an amantadine therapy with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") accepted New Drug Application ("NDA") for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia ("LID") in patients with Parkinson's disease. LID is a form of dyskinesia (abnormality or impairment of voluntary movement) associated with levodopa, a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease. The NDA for ADS-5102 in LID has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") date, or deadline by which the FDA must review the NDA, of August 24, 2017, and, if approved, the Company plans to commercialize ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson's disease in 2017.  ADS-4101 : a lacosamide therapy in clinical development for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy. The active ingredient in ADS-4101 is lacosamide, an anti-epileptic previously approved by the FDA, which is currently marketed by UCB as VIMPAT  (lacosamide).  Namenda XR   (memantine hydrochloride) extended-release capsules and Namzaric  (memantine hydrochloride extended-release and donepezil hydrochloride) capsules: two commercially available drugs currently marketed by Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited ("Forest"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc (collectively, "Allergan") in the United States for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. The Company is eligible to receive royalties on net sales of Namenda XR  and Namzaric  beginning in June of 2018 and May of 2020, respectively. In January 2016, the Company completed a follow-on public offering of 2,875,000 shares of its common stock, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 375,000 shares of common stock, at an offering price of $23.00 per share. Proceeds from the follow-on public offering were approximately $61.8 million , net of underwriting discounts and offering-related transaction costs. The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November15, 2000. The Company's headquarters and operations are located in Emeryville, California. The Company has four insignificant subsidiaries. 2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that the Company believes are necessary for a fair presentation of the periods presented. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2016 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. These interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any other future period and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto for the year ended December31, 2016 , included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. 7 Use of Estimates The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, clinical trial accruals, fair value of assets and liabilities, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and relevant assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Liquidity and Financial Condition  To date, a substantial majority of the Company's resources have been dedicated to the research and development of its products.The Company has not generated any commercial revenue from the sale of its products, and does not anticipate the generation of any commercial product revenue until it receives the necessary regulatory approval to launch one of its products. Based upon the current status of, and plans for, its product development and commercialization, the Company believes that the existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $122.2 million as of March31, 2017 will be adequate to satisfy the Company's capital needs through at least the next twelve months from the issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. However, the process of developing and commercializing products requires significant research and development, preclinical testing and clinical trials, manufacturing arrangements, as well as regulatory approvals. These activities, together with the Company's general and administrative expenses, are expected to result in significant operating losses until the commercialization of the Company's products or license agreements generate sufficient revenue to offsetexpenses. While the Company had net income during 2014, 2013, and 2012, it has not generated any commercial revenue from sales of its products. Under its license agreement with Allergan, the Company received the final milestone payment in 2014, and is not entitled to receive any royalties for net sales of Namzaric  until mid-2020 and Namenda XR  until mid-2018. To achieve sustained profitability, the Company, alone or with others, must successfully develop its product candidates, obtain required regulatory approvals, and successfully manufacture and market its products. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when all four of the following criteria have been met: (i)persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii)delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii)the fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv)collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue under license arrangements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract. Determinations of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fees charged for deliverables and the collectability of those fees. Should changes in conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for any new or modified transactions, revenue recognized could be adversely affected. The Company generates revenue from collaboration and license agreements for the development and commercialization of products. Collaboration and license agreements may include non-refundable upfront license fees, partial or complete reimbursement of research and development costs, contingent consideration payments based on the achievement of defined objectives, and royalties on sales of commercialized products. The Company's performance obligations under the collaboration and license agreements may include the license or transfer of intellectual property rights, obligations to provide research and development services and related materials, and obligations to participate on certain development and/or commercialization committees with the partners. For revenue agreements with multiple-element arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each non-contingent element based on the relative-selling-price of each element in an arrangement. When applying the relative-selling-price method, the Company determines the selling price for each deliverable using the following estimation hierarchy: (i)vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value of the deliverable, if it exists, (ii)third-party evidence of selling price, if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, or (iii)the vendor's best estimate of selling price, if neither vendor-specific nor third-party evidence is available. Revenue allocated is then recognized when the four basic revenue recognition criteria, mentioned above, are met for each element. 8 The Company recognizes payments that are contingent upon achievement of a substantive milestone in their entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. Milestones are defined as events that can only be achieved based on the Company's performance and there is substantive uncertainty about whether the event will be achieved at the inception of the arrangement. Events that are contingent only on the passage of time or only on counterparty performance are not considered milestones subject to this guidance. Further, the amounts received must relate solely to prior performance, be reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the agreement and commensurate with the Company's performance to achieve the milestone after commencement of the agreement. Amounts related to research and development funding and full-time equivalents assigned to the license agreement are recognized as the related services or activities are performed, in accordance with the contract terms. Accounts Receivable  The Company's accounts receivable balance consists of amounts due from Allergan, in accordance with the contract terms of the license agreement, for research and development funding and full-time equivalents assigned to the Allergan license agreement, as well as for reimbursement of external costs, recorded as contra-expense, associated with supporting prosecution and litigation of intellectual property rights. Clinical Trial Accruals  The Company's clinical trial accruals are based on estimates of patient enrollment and related costs at clinical investigator sites as well as estimates for the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations ("CROs") that conduct and manage clinical trials on the Company's behalf. The Company estimates clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on its behalf. In accruing service fees, the Company obtains the reported level of patient enrollment at each site and estimates the time period over which services are to be performed and activity expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, the Company will adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made to third parties under these arrangements in advance of the receipt of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered. Research and Development  Research and development ("R&D") expenses include salaries and related compensation, contractor and consultant fees, external clinical trial expenses performed by CROs, licensing fees, acquired intellectual property with no alternative future use, and facility and administrative expense allocations. In addition, the Company funds R&D at research institutions under agreements that are generally cancelable at its option. Research costs typically consist of applied research and preclinical and toxicology work. Pharmaceutical manufacturing development costs consist of product formulation, chemical analysis, and the transfer and scale-up of manufacturing at facilities operated by the Company's contract manufacturers. Clinical development costs include the costs of Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials. These costs are a significant component of the Company's research and development expenses. The Company accrues costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations and other third parties based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study as provided by the CRO. These estimates are reviewed for reasonableness by the Company'sinternal clinical personnel, and the Company aims to match the accrual to actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities. The Company monitors patient enrollment levels and related activities using available information; however, if the Company underestimates activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time, the Company could be required to record significant additional R&D expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known. The Company charges all such costs to R&D expenses. Non-refundable advance payments are capitalized and expensed as the related goods are delivered or services are performed. Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents are options granted under the 9 Company's stock awards plans and are calculated under the treasury stock method. Common equivalent shares from unexercised stock options and unvested restricted stock units are excluded from the computation when there is a loss as their effect is anti-dilutive, or if the exercise price of such options is greater than the average market price of the stock for the period. The Company incurred net losses for all periods presented and there were no reconciling items for potentially dilutive securities. For the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 5,688,000 and 5,370,000 , respectively, shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Stock-Based Compensation  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation of stock options granted to employees and directors and for employee stock purchase plan shares by estimating the fair value of stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation of restricted stock units granted to employees based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock-based awards are recognized and amortized over the applicable vesting period. All stock options awarded to non-employees are accounted for at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, as calculated using the Black-Scholes model. Stock options granted to non-employees are subject to periodic revaluation at each reporting date as the underlying equity instruments vest. In order to estimate the value of share-based awards, the Company uses the Black-Scholes model, which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions. The most significant subjective assumptions are management's estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from any of these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company's results of operations could be materially impacted. Recent  Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The amendment in this ASU provides guidance on the revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The core principle of this update provides guidance to identify the performance obligations under the contract(s) with a customer and how to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. It further provides guidance to recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance. On July9, 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of this standard to 2018 for public companies, with an option that would permit companies to adopt the standard as early as the original effective date of 2017. Early adoption prior to the original effective date is not permitted. Since the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB has issued several amendments which clarify certain points, including ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , ASU 2016-11, Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting , ASU 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, and ASU 2016-20 , Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company plans to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and effect the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases . The authoritative guidance significantly amends the current accounting for leases. Under the new provisions, all lessees will report a right-of-use asset and a liability for the obligation to make payments for all leases with the exception of those leases with a term of 12 months or less.All other leases will fall into one of two categories: (i) a financing lease or (ii) an operating lease. Lessor accounting remains substantially unchanged with the exception that no leases entered into after the effective date will be classified as leveraged leases. For sale leaseback transactions, a sale will only be recognized if the criteria in the new revenue recognition standard are met. For public business entities, this guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods thereafter.Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 10 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses of Financial Instruments. The new guidance changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 3.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS In accordance with ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, the Company determines the fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy, which establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, as follows:   Level 1 inputs, which include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;   Level 2 inputs, which include observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. For available-for-sale securities, the Company reviews trading activity and pricing as of the measurement date. When sufficient quoted pricing for identical securities is not available, the Company uses market pricing and other observable market inputs for similar securities obtained from various third-party data providers. These inputs either represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or have been derived from observable market data; and   Level 3 inputs, which include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the underlying asset or liability. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation. The following table represents the fair value hierarchy for the Company's financial assets and liabilities which require fair value measurement on a recurring basis (in thousands):   Money market funds are highly liquid investments and are actively traded. The pricing information on these investment instruments are readily available and can be independently validated as of the measurement date. This approach results in the classification of these securities as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 11 Corporate debt and U.S. Treasury notes are measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs. The Company reviews trading activity and pricing for these investments as of each measurement date. When sufficient quoted pricing for identical securities is not available, the Company uses market pricing and other observable market inputs for similar securities obtained from various third party data providers. These inputs represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or these inputs have been derived from observable market data. This approach results in the classification of these securities as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers to or from Level 1 and Level 2 during the three months ended March31, 2017 . 4.INVESTMENTS  The Company's investments consist of corporate debt and U.S. Treasury notes classified as available-for-sale securities. The Company limits the amount of investment exposure as to institution, maturity, and investment type. To mitigate credit risk, the Company invests in investment grade corporate debt and United States Treasury notes. Such securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and shown separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are reclassified from other comprehensive loss to other income (expense) on the condensed consolidated statements of operations when incurred. The Company may pay a premium or receive a discount upon the purchase of available-for-sale securities. Interest earned and gains realized on available-for-sale securities and amortization of discounts received and accretion of premiums paid on the purchase of available-for-sale securities are included in investment income. The following table is a summary of amortized cost, unrealized gain and loss, and the fair value of available-for-sale securities as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 (in thousands): Short-term and long-term investments include accrued interest of $0.4 million and $0.1 million , respectively, as of March31, 2017 . Short-term and long-term investments includes accrued interest of $0.3 million and $0.1 million , respectively, as of December31, 2016 . The Company has not incurred any realized gains or losses on investments for the 12 three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 . Investments are classified as short-term or long-term depending on the underlying investment's maturity date. Long-term investments held by the Company have a maturity date range of greater than 12 months and a maximum of 14 months as of March31, 2017 . 5.LICENSE AGREEMENTS In November 2012, the Company granted Allergan an exclusive license, with right to sublicense, certain of the Company's intellectual property rights relating to human therapeutics containing memantine in the United States. In connection with these rights, Allergan markets and sells Namzaric  and Namenda XR  for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia related to Alzheimer's disease. Pursuant to the agreement, Allergan made an upfront payment of $65.0 million . The Company earned and received additional cash payments totaling $95.0 million upon achievement by Allergan of certain development and regulatory milestones. Under the agreement, external costs incurred related to the prosecution and litigation of intellectual property rights are reimbursable.For the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 , reimbursed expenses amounting to zero and $0.3 million , respectively, are reflected as a reduction to general andadministrative, net. In addition, the Company may earn tiered royalty payments based on future net sales of Namzaric  and Namenda XR  . The Company is entitled to receive royalties on net sales in the United States by Allergan, its affiliates, or any of its sublicensees of controlled-release versions of memantine products covered by the terms of the license agreement. Beginning in May 2020, the Company will be entitled to receive royalties in the low to mid-teens from Allergan for sales of Namzaric  in the United States. Beginning in June 2018, the Company will be entitled to receive royalties in the low to mid-single digits for sales of Namenda XR  in the United States. Allergan's obligation to pay royalties with respect to fixed-dose memantine-donepezil products, including Namzaric  , continues until the later of (i) 15 years after the commercial launch of the first fixed-dose memantine-donepezil product by Allergan in the United States or (ii) the expiration of the Orange Book listed patents for which Allergan obtained rights from the Company covering such product. Allergan's obligation to pay royalties with respect to Namenda XR  continues until the expiration of the Orange Book listed patents covering such products. However, Allergan's obligation to pay royalties for any product covered by the license is eliminated in any quarter where there is significant competition from generics. 6.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments The Company leases approximately 18,500 square feet of office space in Emeryville, California under an operating lease that expires April 30, 2020. The lease provides for periods of escalating rent. The total cash payments over the life of the lease are divided by the total number of months in the lease period and the average rent is charged to expense each month during the lease period. As of March31, 2017 , future minimum lease payments under the non-cancelable facility operating leasewere as follows (in thousands): Purchase Commitments  The Company enters into contracts in the normal course of business that include, among others, arrangements with CROs for clinical trials, vendors for pre-clinical research, and vendors for clinical supply manufacturing. These 13 contracts generally provide for termination upon notice, and therefore the Company believes that its obligations under these agreements are not material. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications. The Company's exposure under these agreements is unknown, because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been made. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. Indemnification  In accordance with the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, the Company has indemnification obligations to its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while they are serving in such capacity. There have been no claims to date, and the Company has a directors and officers liability insurance policy that may enable it to recover a portion of any amounts paid for future claims. Litigation  In November 2012, the Company granted Forest an exclusive license to certain of the Company's intellectual property rights relating to human therapeutics containing memantine in the United States. Under the terms of that license agreement, Forest has the right to enforce such intellectual property rights which are related to its right to market and sell Namzaric  and Namenda XR  for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia related to Alzheimer's disease. The Company has a right to participate in, but not control, such enforcement actions by Forest. As of the date of this filing, several companies have submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market generic versions of Namenda XR  , on which the Company is entitled to receive royalties from Forest beginning in June 2018. In the notices, these companies allege that the patents associated with Namenda XR  , some of which are owned by Forest or licensed by Forest from Merz Pharma GmbH & Co. KGaA, and others of which are owned by the Company and licensed by the Company exclusively to Forest in the United States, are invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed by the companies' manufacture, use, or sale of generic versions of Namenda XR  . The Company, Forest, Merz Pharma GmbH & Co. KGaA, and Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH (together Merz) filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for infringement of the relevant patents against all of these companies except one company for which the Company and Forest recently received that company's notice that its ANDA included one or more certifications pursuant to 21 U.S.C.   355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(iv) and are still evaluating the next steps. The Company and Forest will continue to enforce the patents associated with Namenda XR  . The Company and Forest have entered into a series of settlement agreements with all Namenda XR  ANDA filers, except for one recent ANDA filer and one defendant with respect to the certain patents subject to the Markman ruling described below. Entry dates for generic Namenda XR  are governed by the settlement agreements in that action. Subject to those agreements, the earliest date on which any of these agreements grants a license to market generic version of Namenda XR  is January 31, 2020 or in the alternative, an option to launch an authorized generic version of Namenda XR  beginning on January 31, 2021. In January 2016, the Delaware District Court issued a claim construction (Markman) ruling in the Namenda XR  litigation that includes findings of indefiniteness as to certain claim terms in the asserted patents licensed by the Company to Forest. On July 26, 2016, the District Court issued a final judgment of invalidity on those patents based upon the Markman ruling. The Company and Forest filed the notice of appeal of that final judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeal is ongoing. If the appeal is unsuccessful, generic entry of Namenda XR could occur prior to January 31, 2020. Additionally, as of the date of this filing, a number of companies have submitted ANDAs requesting permission to manufacture and market generic versions of Namzaric  , on which the Company is entitled to receive royalties from Forest beginning in May 2020. The Company and Forest have filed lawsuits alleging infringement of the relevant patents against Namzaric  ANDA filers, who are seeking to launch generic versions of Namzaric  , in the same court as heard the Namenda XR  litigation.As of the date of this filing, the Company and Forest have settled with all but one of the 14 ANDA filers, including all first filers on all the available dosage forms of Namzaric  , granting a license to market the first generic versions of Namzaric  on January 1, 2025 subject to the settlement agreements. For the one ANDA filer that the Company and Forest have not settled with, the Company and Forest recently received that ANDA filer's notice that its ANDA included one or more certifications pursuant to 21 U.S.C.   355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(iv) and are still evaluating the next steps. The Company and Forest will continue to enforce the patents associated with Namzaric  . From time to time, the Company may be party to legal proceedings, investigations, and claims in the ordinary course of its business. Other than the matters described above, the Company is not currently party to any material legal proceedings. 7.STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Common Stock The amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the Company to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock. Common stockholders are entitled to dividends as and when declared by the board of directors, subject to the rights of holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights as to dividends. There have been no dividends declared to date. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. Public Offering In January 2016, the Company completed a follow-on public offering of 2,875,000 shares of common stock, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 375,000 shares of common stock, at an offering price of $23.00 per share. Proceeds from the follow-on public offering were approximately $61.8 million , net of underwriting discounts and offering-related transaction costs. Shares reserved for Future Issuance Shares of Company's common stock reserved for future issuance are as follows: 8.STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Stock Compensation Plans In January 2017 , the common stock available for issuance under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") automatically increased by 4% of the total number of shares of the Company's capital stock outstanding on December31, 2016 , or 880,362 shares. In March 2016, the Company's board of directors approved the 2016 Inducement Plan (the "Inducement Plan") under which 450,000 shares of the Company's common stock were made available for issuance. In January 2017, an amendment to the Inducement Plan was approved to increase the number of shares available for issuance an additional 450,000 shares for a total of 900,000 shares. Employee Stock Purchase Plan In January 2017 , the common stock available for issuance under the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") automatically increased by 1% of the total number of shares of the Company's capital stock outstanding on December31, 2016 , or 220,090 shares. 15 Stock-Based CompensationExpense The following table reflects stock-based compensation expense recognized for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):  16 
ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our  condensed consolidated  financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section of this report entitled "Risk factors." Overview We are a pharmaceutical company thatdiscovers and develops chrono-synchronous therapies to improve the daily lives of people affected by chronic neurologic disorders. Approximately 36 million people in the United States suffer from conditions such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. Currently available medicines may lead to sub-optimal symptom control in these disorders. We pioneered a platform to develop medicines for chronic neurologic disorders based upon an understanding of time-dependent biologic processes responsible for disease activity and drug response. We call these medicines chrono-synchronous therapies. These therapies synchronize the temporal pattern of disease activity with the dynamics of drug profiles we invent without disrupting the brain's master clock, e.g. circadian rhythm. We believe the lives of patients with neurologic disorders are improved when these factors operate in unison. We identify and develop chrono-synchronous therapies for patients by listening, studying, and innovating. To that end, our aim is to enable substantial treatment effects among the existing landscape of medicines. Our portfolio includes:  ADS-5102 : an amantadine therapy with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") accepted New Drug Application ("NDA") for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia ("LID") in patients with Parkinson's disease. LID is a form of dyskinesia associated with levodopa, a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease. Over time, 90% of Parkinson's disease patients on levodopa therapy will develop alternating periods of OFF time (e.g. rigidity) and LID, as their disease progresses. LID is characterized by involuntary movements that are purposeless and unpredictable. The NDA for ADS-5102 in LID has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") date, or deadline by which the FDA must review the NDA, of August 24, 2017, and, if approved, we plan to commercialize ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson's disease in 2017. If approved, ADS-5102 will be the first and only medicine approved for the treatment of LID, and it will be the only Parkinson's disease medicine demonstrated to reduce both LID and the time when the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are present, referred to as "OFF time". In addition, we believe ADS-5102 has opportunities to provide symptomatic treatment of other hyper- and hypokinetic neurologic disorders, including but not limited to walking impairment in multiple sclerosis patients and other Parkinson's disease indications.  ADS-4101 : a lacosamide therapy in clinical development for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy. The active ingredient in ADS-4101 is lacosamide, an anti-epileptic previously approved by the FDA, which is currently marketed by UCB as VIMPAT  (lacosamide).  Namenda XR   (memantine hydrochloride) extended-release capsules and Namzaric  (memantine hydrochloride extended-release and donepezil hydrochloride) capsules: two commercially available drugs currently marketed by Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited ("Forest"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc (collectively, "Allergan"), in the United States for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. We are eligible to receive royalties on sales of Namenda XR  and Namzaric  beginning in June of 2018 and May of 2020, respectively. Our goal is to bring products to market, which are differentiated and distinguished by our platform insights, independently or in collaboration with partners. From prior experience, we appreciate the value that commercial strategic alliances can bring to patients and Adamas stakeholders. 17 In 2017, we are focused on commercializing ADS-5102, if approved, for the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson's disease. Based on our market research, we expect ADS-5102 to be well received by physicians, patients, and payers, as there are currently no approved therapeutic treatments for LID, which is an existing Parkinson's disease treatment gap. Our research also indicates that payers recognize the substantial unmet need of patients with LID and the potentially important value proposition of ADS-5102 in LID, as well as its secondary benefit in OFF time, when the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are present. Financial operations overview Summary Our revenue to date has been generated primarily from license, milestone, and development revenue pursuant to our license agreement with Allergan. We have not generated any commercial product revenue. As of March31, 2017 , we had an accumulated deficit of $138.2 million . Although we reported net income in each of the years ended December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, this was primarily due to the recognition of revenue pursuant to our license agreement with Allergan. There are no further milestone payments to be earned under our license agreement with Allergan. We incurred significant losses in the three months ended  March31, 2017 , in 2016, 2015, and prior to 2012, and expect to continue to incur significant losses as we advance our product candidates into later stages of development and, if approved, commercialization. We plan to commercialize ADS-5102 for LID, if approved, and potentially other wholly-owned product candidates by developing a commercial organization, including either our own sales force or a contract sales organization, targeting neurologists and movement disorder specialists in the United States, or possibly through partnership agreements with pharmaceutical companies. Consequently, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we approach a potential product commercialization of ADS-5102 for LID currently contemplated to be later in 2017. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we continue to advance our product candidates through clinical development. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development and commercialization, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of expenses incurred or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Under our agreement with Allergan, beginning in May2020, we are entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low to mid-teens for net sales of Namzaric  in the United States. In addition, we are also entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low to mid-single digits from Allergan for net sales of Namenda XR  in the United States beginning in June2018; however, we do not expect the Namenda XR  royalties will make a significant financial contribution to our business. Pursuant to the agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront license fee of $65.0million in 2012, which we recognized on a straight-line basis from November2012 to February2013. We also earned and received additional cash payments totaling $95.0 million upon achievement by Allergan of certain development and regulatory milestones, which we recognized in 2013 and 2014. Prior to our initial public offering of our common stock, or IPO, in April2014, we had raised an aggregate of approximately $87.2million through the sale of convertible preferred stock and $1.0 million through the exercise of preferred stock warrants. In 2014, we issued and sold 3,081,371 shares of common stock in our IPO and received net proceeds of approximately $42.6 million, which included partial exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares and after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. In connection with the completion of our IPO, all convertible preferred stock converted into common stock. In June2015, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement, pursuant to which we were able to issue and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering value of up to $25.0 million , which was terminated in November 2016. During the term of the agreement, we issued 509,741 shares of common stock and raised net proceeds of $9.7 million . In January 2016, we raised $61.8 million from the sale of 2,875,000 shares of common stock in a follow-on public offering. As of March31, 2017 , we had cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities of $122.2 million . Revenue We have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales to date. Our revenue to date has been generated primarily from non-refundable upfront license payments, milestone payments, reimbursements for research and development expenses and full-time equivalents assigned under our license agreement with Allergan, and to a lesser degree reimbursement for research and development expenses from NIH grants and government contracts. We do not 18 expect to recognize any further milestone payments under our license agreement with Allergan, and we expect reimbursements for full-time equivalents assigned to the license agreement to be inconsequential in future periods. Beginning in May2020, we will be entitled to receive royalties in the low to mid-teens from Allergan for net sales of Namzaric  in the United States, and in June2018 we will be entitled to receive royalties in the low to mid-single digits for net sales of Namenda XR  in the United States; however, we do not expect the Namenda XR royalties will make a significant financial contribution to our business. We were also awarded a continuation of an NIH grant for $1.0 million in August2014 that terminated in July 2016, which we administered, but conducted through subcontractors. Research and development expenses Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research, such as the discovery and development of our wholly-owned product candidates and, to a lesser degree, the development of product candidates pursuant to our agreement with Allergan. We recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expenses consist of:   fees paid to clinical investigators, clinical trial sites, consultants, and vendors, including contract research organizations, or CROs, in conjunction with implementing, conducting, and monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating clinical trial data, including all related fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening fees, laboratory work, and statistical compilation and analysis;   expenses related to production of clinical supplies, including fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs;   expenses related to compliance with regulatory requirements;   other consulting fees paid to third parties; and   employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): The program-specific expenses summarized in the table above include costs directly attributable to our product candidates. Other research and development expenses include costs for early stage programs and costs not allocated to a specific program. We allocate research and development salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, and indirect costs to our product candidates on a program-specific basis, and we include these costs in the program-specific expenses. We begin to track and report program-specific expenses for early stage programs once they have been nominated and selected for further development and clinical-stage work has commenced. The largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities, including the clinical development of our product candidates. We anticipate incurring significant research and development expenses as we continue to support: the FDA's review of ADS-5102 for LID; clinical trials for ADS-5102 in indications beyond LID, including but not limited to walking impairment in multiple sclerosis patients and other Parkinson's disease indications earlier in the Parkinson's disease treatment journey; ADS-4101 for treatment of epilepsy; and potentially additional clinical-stage programs in more indications or for future product candidates. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain FDA approval is costly and time consuming. We consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long-term success. The actual probability of success for each product candidate and clinical program may be affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, the quality of the product candidate, early clinical data, investment in the program, competition, 19 manufacturing capability, and commercial viability. Furthermore, in the past we have entered into licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize our product candidates, and we may enter into additional licensing arrangements or collaborations in the future. In situations in which third parties have control over the clinical development of a product candidate, the estimated completion dates are largely under the control of such third parties and not under our control. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates, if any, will be subject to future licensing or collaboration arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. General and administrative expenses, net General and administrative expenses, net, consist primarily of personnel and related benefit costs, facilities, professional services, insurance, and public company related expenses, as well as increasingly the costs associated with establishing commercial capabilities in support of the potential commercialization of ADS-5102 for LID, reduced to a small degree by reimbursement from Allergan for external costs related to supporting prosecution and litigation of intellectual property rights under our license agreement. We anticipate our general and administrative expenses will increase significantly as we continue to establish our commercial capabilities and support our potential commercial-stage programs. If ADS-5102 is approved by the FDA, we plan to market and sell through our own sales force or through a contract sales organization, targeting neurologists and movement disorder specialists in the United States, or possibly through collaboration and license agreements with pharmaceutical companies. Interest and other income (expense), net Interest and other income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest received on our investments. Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We have discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no significant and material changes in our critical accounting policies during the three months ended March31, 2017 , as compared to those disclosed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2016 . Results of operations Comparison of  the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016  The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except percentages): 20 Revenue Revenue for the three months ended March31, 2017 was zero , compared to $0.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Revenue for the period in 2016 was primarily related to reimbursement of certain expenses as provided for in our license agreement with Allergan, as well as from government contracts. Research and development expenses Research and development expenses decreased by $0.4 million , or 6% to $7.1 million for the three months ended March31, 2017 from $7.5 million for the three months ended March31, 2016 . The decrease in research and development expenses was mainly attributable to costs associated with the clinical development of ADS-5102, due to the conclusion of two Phase 3 clinical trials assessing ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID, in addition to costs associated with the ongoing open-label safety study which decreased slightly from the prior quarter.The decrease was offset in part by increased efforts related to pre-commercial manufacturing activities in preparation for the commercialization of ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID, if approved, in addition to increased expenses related to clinical work associated with ADS-4101 for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy. Included in research and development expenses was stock-based compensation expense, which was $0.8 million compared to $0.7 million for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. General and administrative expenses, net General and administrative expenses, net, increased by $2.5 million , or 38% , to $9.1 million for the three months ended March31, 2017 from $6.6 million for the three months ended March31, 2016 . The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased costs associated with establishing commercial capabilities in anticipation of the commercialization of ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID, pending regulatory approval, including an increase in headcount-related expenses and commercial activities. General and administrative expenses also included stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million compared to $1.9 million for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Interest and other income, net Interest and other income, net, was essentially unchanged at $0.2 million for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 . Net interest income is primarily due to interest income earned on investments. Liquidity, capital resources and plan of operation We have funded our operations primarily through $160.0 million of payments received pursuant to our license agreement with Allergan, $88.2 million sales of convertible preferred stock and warrants, and $114.1 million pursuant to sales of our common stock. In April 2014, we completed our IPO and raised net proceeds of $42.6 million, including the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares. In June2015, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement, pursuant to which we were able to, from time to time, issue and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering value of up to $25.0 million, which was terminated in November 2016. During the term of the agreement we issued 509,741 shares of common stock and raised net proceeds of $9.7 million. On January 6, 2016, we completed a follow-on public offering of 2,875,000 shares of common stock, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 375,000 shares of common stock, at an offering price of $23.00 per share. Proceeds from the follow-on public offering were approximately $61.8 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering-related transaction costs. We have not generated any revenue from the sale of products. We incurred losses and generated negative cash flows from operations since inception through the year ended December31, 2011. Although we recognized a profit and positive cash flow in 2014, 2013, and 2012 as a result of payments received pursuant to our license agreement with Allergan, we received our final milestone payment from Allergan in December2014.We do not currently receive any royalties from Allergan, nor do we have other license agreements or collaborations from which we might expect milestone or royalty revenue. Consequently, we expect to continue to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future. Our principal sources of liquidity were our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, which totaled $122.2 million as of March31, 2017 , compared to $135.9 million at December31, 2016 . We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements, including operations related to the continued development and potential commercialization of 21 ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID, for at least the next 12 months. However, it is possible that we will not achieve the progress that we expect, because the actual costs and timing of drug development, particularly clinical studies, and regulatory approvals are difficult to predict, subject to substantial risks and delays, and often vary depending on the particular indication and development strategy. Moreover, the costs associated with commercializing drugs are high and market acceptance is uncertain. We expect to continue significant spending in connection with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, particularly for ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID, as well as other indications. In order to continue these activities, we may decide to raise additional funds through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, royalty financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, asset sales, and other marketing and distribution arrangements. Sufficient additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available in the future, we may need to delay, reduce the scope of, or put on hold our clinical studies, research and development programs, or commercialization efforts. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands): Net cash used in operating activities was $13.9 million for the three months ended March31, 2017 compared to $12.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Net loss of $16.0 million for the three months ended March31, 2017 included net non-cash adjustments of $3.4 million , which consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $2.9 million . Net loss of $13.8 million for the three months ended March31, 2016 included non-cash adjustments of $2.9 million , primarily related to $2.6 million in stock-based compensation. The primary use of cash for the three months ended March31, 2017 was to fund activities in support of the NDA and pre-commercial activities in preparation for the commercialization for ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID, if approved. Net cash provided by investing activities was $10.4 million for the three months ended March31, 2017 , compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $15.6 million for the same period in the prior year. Net cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended March31, 2017 was a result of $10.8 million in net maturities of available-for-sale securities, offset by $0.4 million in purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended March31, 2016 was a result of $16.1 million in maturities of available-for-sale securities, offset by $0.5 million in purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities was $0.7 million for the three months ended March31, 2017 , compared to $62.2 million for the three months ended March31, 2016 . In the period ended March31, 2017 , we received cash proceeds of $0.7 million related to the exercise of stock options. In the three months ended March31, 2016 , we received $61.8 million, inclusive of $0.2 million of offering costs recorded in accounts payable, related to the sale of common stock under a follow-on public offering, coupled with $0.2 million related to the exercise of stock options. Off-balance sheet arrangements Since our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities, or variable interest entities. Contractual obligations Our future contractual obligations at March31, 2017 , were not materially different than at December31, 2016 . 22
