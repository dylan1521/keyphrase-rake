NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    (unaudited)        1.DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS        Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the "Company") is a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics targeting chronic disorders of the central nervous systems ("CNS"). The Company seeks to achieve this by enhancing the pharmacokinetic profiles of approved drugs to create novel therapeutics for use alone and in fixed-dose combination products. The Company is currently developing two wholly-owned product candidates. The first product candidate is ADS-5102 (amantadine hydrochloride) extended-release capsules for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia ("LID") associated with the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The Company has obtained an orphan designation for ADS-5102 in that indication. Also, the Company is exploring the utility of ADS-5102 for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis. The second product candidate is ADS-4101, an extended-release version of an FDA-approved single-agent compound for the treatment of epilepsy (partial onset seizures).        In addition, the Company contributed to the development of  two medicines , which have been exclusively licensed to Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited ("Forest Laboratories" or "Forest"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc: Namzaric  (memantine hydrochloride extended-release and donepezil hydrochloride) capsules; and Namenda XR  (memantine hydrochloride) extended-release capsules.         In January 2016, the Company completed a follow-on public offering of 2,875,000 shares of its common stock, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 375,000 shares of common stock, at an offering price of $23.00 per share. Proceeds from the follow-on public offering were approximately $61.8 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering-related transaction costs.        The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November15, 2000. The Company's headquarters and operations are located in Emeryville, California. The Company has four insignificant subsidiaries.        2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Basis of Presentation            The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that the Company believes are necessary for a fair presentation of the periods presented. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. These interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any other future period and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.        Liquidity and Financial Condition        To date, nearly all of the Company's resources have been dedicated to the research and development of its products .  T he Company has not generated any commercial revenue from the sale of its products , and does not anticipate the generation of any commercial product revenue until it receives the necessary regulatory approval to launch one of its products.         7                 Based upon the current status of, and plans for, its product development, the Company believes that the existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $158.0 million as of June 30, 2016 will be adequate to satisfy the Company's capital needs through at least the next twelve months. However, the process of developing and commercializing products requires significant research and development, preclinical testing and clinical trials, manufacturing arrangements, as well as regulatory approvals. These activities, together with the Company's general and administrative expenses, are expected to result in significant operating losses until the commercialization of the Company's products or license agreements generate sufficient revenue to offset  expenses. While the Company had net income during 2014 and 2013, it has not generated any commercial revenue from sales of its products. Under its license agreement with Forest, the Company received the final milestone payment in 2014, and is not entitled to receive any royalties for sales of Namzaric until mid-2020 and Namenda XR until mid-2018. To achieve sustained profitability, the Company, alone or with others, must successfully develop its product candidates, obtain required regulatory approvals, and successfully manufacture and market its products.        Use of Estimates            The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, clinical trial accruals, fair value of assets and liabilities, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and relevant assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates.        Forward Stock Split        In March2014, the Board of Directors of the Company and stockholders approved a forward stock split of the Company's common and preferred stock. As a result, common and preferred stock, stock options and warrants to purchase common and preferred stock were adjusted in the ratio of 2 :1, effective March24, 2014. All common and preferred shares and per share amounts presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements for all periods have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 2 -for-1 forward stock split. No fractional shares were issued.        Revenue Recognition        The Company recognizes revenue when all four of the following criteria have been met: (i)persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii)delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii)the fee is fixed or determinable and (iv)collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue under license arrangements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract. Determinations of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fees charged for deliverables and the collectability of those fees. Should changes in conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for any new or modified transactions, revenue recognized could be adversely affected.        The Company generates revenue from collaboration and license agreements for the development and commercialization of products. Collaboration and license agreements may include non-refundable upfront license fees, partial or complete reimbursement of research and development costs, contingent consideration payments based on the achievement of defined objectives , and royalties on sales of commercialized products. The Company's performance obligations under the collaboration and license agreements may include the license or transfer of intellectual property rights, obligations to provide research and development services and related materials , and obligations to participate on certain development and/or commercialization committees with the partners.         8                 For revenue agreements with multiple-element arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each non-contingent element based on the relative-selling-price of each element in an arrangement. When applying the relative-selling-price method, the Company determines the selling price for each deliverable using the following estimation hierarchy: (i)vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value of the deliverable, if it exists, (ii)third-party evidence of selling price, if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available or (iii) the vendor's best estimate of selling price, if neither vendor-specific nor third-party evidence is available. Revenue allocated is then recognized when the four basic revenue recognition criteria, mentioned above, are met for each element .        The Company recognizes payments that are contingent upon achievement of a substantive milestone in their entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. Milestones are defined as events that can only be achieved based on the Company's performance and there is substantive uncertainty about whether the event will be achieved at the inception of the arrangement. Events that are contingent only on the passage of time or only on counterparty performance are not considered milestones subject to this guidance. Further, the amounts received must relate solely to prior performance, be reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the agreement and commensurate with the Company's performance to achieve the milestone after commencement of the agreement.        Amounts related to research and development funding and full-time equivalents assigned to the license agreement are recognized as the related services or activities are performed, in accordance with the contract terms.        Clinical Trial Accruals        The Company's clinical trial accruals are based on estimates of patient enrollment and related costs at clinical investigator sites as well as estimates for the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations ("CROs") that conduct and manage clinical trials on the Company's behalf.        The Company estimates clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on its behalf. In accruing service fees, the Company obtains the reported level of patient enrollment at each site and estimates the time period over which services will be performed and activity expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, the Company will adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made to third parties under these arrangements in advance of the receipt of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered.        Research and Development        Research and development ("R&D") expenses include salaries and related compensation, contractor and consultant fees, external clinical trial expenses performed by contract research organizations ("CRO"), licensing fees, acquired intellectual property with no alternative future use, and facility and administrative expense allocations. In addition, the Company funds R&D at research institutions under agreements that are generally cancelable at its option. Research costs typically consist of applied research and preclinical and toxicology work. Pharmaceutical manufacturing development costs consist of product formulation, chemical analysis, and the transfer and scale-up of manufacturing at the Company's contract manufacturers. Clinical development costs include the costs of Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials. These costs are a significant component of the Company's research and development expenses.        The Company accrues costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations and other third parties based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study as provided by the CRO. These estimates are reviewed for reasonableness by the Company's  internal clinical personnel, and the Company aims to match the accrual to actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities. The Company monitors patient enrollment levels and related activities using available information; however, if      9             the Company underestimates activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time, the Company could be required to record significant additional R&D expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known. The Company charges all such costs to R&D expenses. Non-refundable advance payments are capitalized and expensed as the related goods are delivered or services are performed.        Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share        Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents are options granted under the Company's stock awards plans and are calculated under the treasury stock method. Common equivalent shares from unexercised stock options and unvested restricted stock units are excluded from the computation when there is a loss as their effect is anti-dilutive, or if the exercise price of such options is greater than the average market price of the stock for the period. The Company incurred net losses for all periods presented and there were no reconciling items for potentially dilutive securities. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, approximately 5,714,000 and 5,542,000 , respectively, shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, approximately 1,496,000 and 1,798,000 , respectively, shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.         Stock-Based Compensation        The Company accounts for stock-based compensation of stock options granted to employees and directors and for employee stock purchase plan shares by estimating the fair value of stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation of restricted stock units granted to employees based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock-based awards are recognized and amortized over the applicable vesting period. All stock options awarded to non-employees are accounted for at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, as calculated using the Black-Scholes model. Stock options granted to non-employees are subject to periodic revaluation at each reporting date as the underlying equity instruments vest.        In order to estimate the value of share-based awards, the Company uses the Black-Scholes model, which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions. The most significant subjective assumptions are management's estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from any of these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company's results of operations could be materially impacted.        Recent Accounting Pronouncements        In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The amendment in this ASU provides guidance on the revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The core principle of this update provides guidance to identify the performance obligations under the contract(s) with a customer and how to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. It further provides guidance to recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance. On July9, 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of this standard to 2018 for public companies, with an option that would permit companies to adopt the standard as early as the original effective date of 2017. Early adoption prior to the original effective date is not permitted. Since the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB has issued several amendments which clarify certain points, including ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting      10             Revenue Gross versus Net) , ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , ASU 2016-11, Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting , and ASU 201-16, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients .  The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect s of the standard s on its consolidated financial statements.         In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . This ASU provides guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a Company's ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods ending after December15, 2016, and for interim periods within annual periods beginning after December15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The Company is evaluating the impact the revised guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements .     In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . Under ASU 2015-17, a reporting entity is required to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. Current guidance requiring the offsetting of deferred tax assets and liabilities of a tax-paying component of an entity and presentation as a single noncurrent amount is not affected. This ASU is effective for public business entities issuing financial statements for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. Entities may apply the update prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities and taxes, or retrospectively for all periods presented. The effects of this update on the Company's consolidated financial statements are not expected to be material.        In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases . The authoritative guidance significantly amends the current accounting for leases. Under the new provisions, all lessees will report a right-of-use asset and a liability for the obligation to make payments for all leases with the exception of those leases with a term of 12 months or less.All other leases will fall into one of two categories: (i) a financing lease or (ii) an operating lease. Lessor accounting remains substantially unchanged with the exception that no leases entered into after the effective date will be classified as leveraged leases. For sale leaseback transactions, a sale will only be recognized if the criteria in the new revenue recognition standard are met. For public business entities, this guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods thereafter.Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.        In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation .The new guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.            3.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS        In accordance with ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, the Company determines the fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy, which establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, as follows:               Level 1 inputs , which include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;     11                      Level 2 inputs , which include observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. For available-for-sale securities, the Company reviews trading activity and pricing as of the measurement date. When sufficient quoted pricing for identical securities is not available, the Company uses market pricing and other observable market inputs for similar securities obtained from various third-party data providers. These inputs either represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or have been derived from observable market data; and          Level 3 inputs , which include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the underlying asset or liability. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies , or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.       The following table represents the fair value hierarchy for the Company's financial assets and liabilities which require fair value measurement on a recurring basis (in thousands):                      Money market funds are highly liquid investments and are actively traded. The pricing information on these investment instruments are readily available and can be independently validated as of the measurement date. This approach results in the classification of these securities as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.        Corporate debt and U.S. Treasury notes are measured at fair value using L evel 2 inputs. The Company reviews trading activity and pricing for these investments as of each measurement date. When sufficient quoted pricing for identical securities is not available, the Company uses market pricing and other observable market inputs for similar securities obtained from various third party data providers. These inputs represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or these inputs have been derived from observable market data. This approach results in the classification of these securities as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.        There were no  transfers to or from Level 1 and Level 2 during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.        4.INVESTMENTS        The Company's investments consist of corporate debt and U.S. Treasury notes classified as available-for-sale securities.             12             The Company limits the amount of investment exposure as to institution, maturity, and investment type. To mitigate credit risk, the Company invests in investment grade corporate debt and United States Treasury notes. Such securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and shown separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are reclassified from other comprehensive loss to other income (expense) on the condensed consolidated statements of operations when incurred. The Company may pay a premium or receive a discount upon the purchase of available-for-sale securities. Interest earned and gains realized on available-for-sale securities and amortization of discounts received and accretion of premiums paid on the purchase of available-for-sale securities are included in investment income.        The following table is a summary of amortized cost, unrealized gain and loss, and the fair value of available-for-sale securities as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):                      Short -term and long-term investments include s accrued interest of  $0 .2 million and $4,000 respectively, as of June 30, 2016. Short-term and long-term investments includes accrued interest of $0.4 million and $36,000 , respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The Company has not incurred any realized gains or losses on investments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Investments are classified as short-term or long-term depending on the underlying investment's maturity date. Long-term investments held by the Company have a maturity date range of greater than 12 months and a maximum of 14 months as of June 30, 2016.        5. License Agreements        In November 2012, the Company granted Forest an exclusive license, with right to sublicense, certain of the Company's intellectual property rights relating to human therapeutics containing memantine in the United States. In connection with these rights, Forest markets and sells Namzaric and Namenda XR for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia related to Alzheimer's disease. Pursuant to the agreement, Forest made an upfront payment of $65.0 million. The Company earned and received additional cash payments totaling $95.0 million upon achievement by Forest of certain development and regulatory milestones. Under the agreement, external costs incurred related to the      13             prosecution and litigation of intellectual property rights are reimbursable. For the  six months ended June 30, 2016 , reimbursed expenses amounting to $1 .2 million are reflected as a reduction to general andadministrative, net.        The Company is entitled to receive royalties on net sales in the United States by Forest, its affiliates, or any of its sublicensees of controlled-release versions of memantine products covered by the terms of the license agreement. Beginning in May 2020, the Company will be entitled to receive royalties in the low to mid-teens from Forest for sales of Namzaric in the United States . Beginning in June 2018, the Company will be entitled to receive royalties in the low to mid-single digits for sales of Namenda XR in the United States. Forest's obligation to pay royalties with respect to fixed-dose memantine-donepezil products, including Namzaric, continues until the later of (i) 15 years after the commercial launch of the first fixed-dose memantine-donepezil product by Forest in the United States or (ii) the expiration of the Orange Book listed patents for which Forest obtained rights from the Company covering such product. Forest's obligation to pay royalties with respect to Namenda XR continues until the expiration of the Orange Book listed patents covering such products. However, Forest's obligation to pay royalties for any product covered by the license is eliminated in any quarter where there is significant competition from generics.        6.WARRANTS TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK         In conjunction with various financings between 2002 and 2012, the Company issued warrants to purchase 758,994 shares of convertible preferred stock and 127,780 shares of common stock. The relative fair value of these warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes model and was amortized to interest expense over the term of each loan, unless subsequently modified.          Immediately prior to the completion of the Company's IPO in 2014, 206,162 of the warrants to purchase common stock were either exercised for cash or automatically net exercised for a total issuance of 199,837 shares of common stock, pursuant to the terms of the warrants. In July 2015, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 7,116 shares of common stock were exercised in a cashless exercise, resulting in the issuance of 3,484 shares of common stock. As of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no warrants to purchase common stock outstanding.                7.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES        Lease Commitments        The Company leases approximately 18,500 square feet of office space in Emeryville, California under an operating lease that expires April 30, 2020. The lease provides for periods of escalating rent. The total cash payments over the life of the lease are divided by the total number of months in the lease period and the average rent is charged to expense each mon th during the lease period.        As of June 30, 2016, future minimum lease payments under the non-cancelable facility operating lease  were as follows (in thousands):                  14             Contingencies        In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications. The Company's exposure under these agreements is unknown, because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been made. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.        Indemnification        In accordance with the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, the Company has indemnification obligations to its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while they are serving in such capacity. There have been no claims to date, and the Company has a directors and officers liability insurance policy that may enable it to recover a portion of any amounts paid for future claims.        Litigation        In November 2012, the Company granted Forest an exclusive license to certain of the Company's intellectual property rights relating to human therapeutics containing memantine in the United States. Under the terms of that license agreement, Forest has the right to enforce such intellectual property rights which are related to its right to market and sell Namzaric and Namenda XR for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia related to Alzheimer's disease. The Company has a right to participate in, but not control, such enforcement actions by Forest.        As of the date of this filing, several companies have submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market generic versions of Namenda XR, on which the Company is entitled to receive royalties from Forest beginning in June 2018. In the notices, these companies allege that the patents associated with Namenda XR, some of which are owned by Forest or licensed by Forest from Merz Pharma GmbH & Co. KGaA, and others of which are owned by the Company and licensed by the Company exclusively to Forest in the United States, are invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed by the companies' manufacture, use, or sale of generic versions of Namenda XR. The Company, Forest, Merz Pharma GmbH & Co. KGaA, and Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH (together Merz) filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for infringement of the relevant patents against all of these companies. The parties are collectively seeking judgment that (i) the defendants have infringed the patents at issue, (ii) the effective date of any approval of the defendants' ANDAs shall not be earlier than the expiration date of the last to expire of the relevant patents, including any extensions or exclusivities, (iii) the defendants be enjoined from commercially manufacturing, using, offering for sale, or selling in the United States, or importing into the United States, any products that infringe or induce or contribute to the infringement of the patents at issue prior to the expiration date of the last to expire of the patents, including extensions and exclusivities, and (iv) the Company, Forest, and Merz be awarded monetary relief, in addition to any attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses relating to the actions.        The Company and Forest have entered into a series of settlement agreements with the Namenda XR ANDA filers, except for one defendant with respect to the certain patents subject to the Markman ruling described below . Entry dates for generic Namenda XR are governed by the settlement agreements in that action. Subject to those agreements, t he earliest date on which any of these agreements grants a license to market generic version of Namenda XR is January 31, 2020 or in the alternative, an option to launch an authorized generic version of Namenda XR beginning on January 31, 2021.        In January 2016, the Delaware District Court issued a claim construction (Markman) ruling in the Namenda XR litigation that includes findings of indefiniteness as to certain claim terms in the asserted patents licensed by the Company to Forest . On July 26 , 2016, the District Court issued a final judgment of invalidity on those patents based      15             upon the Markman ruling. The Company and Forest plan to appeal that final judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .        Additionally, as of the date of this filing, four companies have submitted ANDAs requesting permission to manufacture and market generic versions of Namzaric, on which the Company is entitled to receive royalties from Forest beginning in May 2020. The Company and Forest have begun to file lawsuits alleging infringement of the relevant patents against Namzaric ANDA filers , who are seeking to launch generic versions of Namzaric, in the same court as heard the Namenda XR litigation . As of the date of this filing, the Company and Forest have settled with two defendant s , granting a license to market generic version s of Namzaric in 2029 , although that date may not apply in any future settlements . The Markman hearing for these lawsuits is scheduled for November 2016 and the trial is scheduled for October 2017.        Because the Namzaric enforcement actions were filed within the requisite 45-day period provided in the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, there are stays preventing FDA approval of the ANDAs involved in both litigations for 30 months or until a court decision adverse to the patents. The 30-month stays for the Namzaric ANDAs will expire beginning in January 2018.        From time to time, the Company may be party to legal proceedings, investigations, and claims in the ordinary course of its business. Other than the matters described above, the Company is not presently a party to any material legal proceedings.            8.STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY        Common Stock        The amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the Company to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock. Common stockholders are entitled to dividends as and when declared by the board of directors, subject to the rights of holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights as to dividends. There have been no dividends declared to date. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote.        The Company has classified payments received for all unvested shares of common stock issued upon the early exercise of stock options as employee deposits (a liability) as these options are not considered to be substantively exercised until vested. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, zero and 3,000 shares of common stock, respectively, from early exercised options were unvested.        Controlled Equity Offering        On June 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement ("Sales Agreement"), with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. ("Cantor"), as sales agent, pursuant to which the Company may, at its discretion, issue and sell common stock from time to time with a value of up to a maximum of $25.0 million in an at-the-market offering. All sales of shares have been made pursuant to a shelf registration statement that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on June 1, 2015. Cantor has acted as sole sales agent for any sales made under the Sales Agreement for a 3% commission on gross proceeds.The common stock has been sold at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, and, as a result, prices have varied . Unless otherwise terminated earlier, the Sales Agreement continues to be in effect until all shares available under the Sales Agreement have been sold. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, there were no additional shares sold under the Sales Agreement. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had sold a total of 509,741 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement at an average price of $20.04 for net proceeds of $9.7 million.             16             Public Offering        On January 6, 2016, the Company completed a follow-on public offering of 2,875,000 shares of common stock, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 375,000 shares of common stock, at an offering price of $23.00 per share. Proceeds from the follow-on public offering were approximately $61.8 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering-related transaction costs.        Shares reserved for Future Issuance        Shares of Company's common stock reserved for future issuance are as follows:                     9.STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION        Stock Compensation Plans        In 2014, the Company's board of directors adopted, and in March 2014 the Company's stockholders approved, the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan"), which became effective on the completion of the IPO. The number of shares of the Company's common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2014 Plan will automatically increase on the first day of each fiscal year for a period of up to 10 years, commencing on the first day of the fiscal year following 2014, in an amount equal to 4% of the total number of shares of the Company's capital stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding fiscal year, or a lesser number of shares as determined by the Company's board of directors. For 2016, the common stock available for issuance under the 2014 Plan increased by 739,708 shares of common stock.        In March 2016, the Company's board of directors approved the 2016 Inducement Plan (the "Inducement Plan") under which 450,000 shares of the Company's common stock were made available for issuance. Options granted under the Inducement Plan may have terms of up to ten years. Consistent with the 2014 Plan, options granted generally vest over four years and vest at a rate of 25% upon the first anniversary of the issuance date and 1/48th per month thereafter. Restricted stock units granted vest at a rate of 25% per year over four years. The Inducement Plan was adopted by the board of directors without stockholder approval pursuant to Rule 5635(c)(4) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules.             17             The stock option and related activity under all of the Company's stock compensation plans is summarized as follows:             The restricted stock unit and related activity under the Company's stock compensation plans is summarized as follows:             Employee Stock Purchase Plan    In February 2014, the Company's board of directors adopted and, in March 2014, the Company's stockholders approved, the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), which became effective on the completion of the Company's IPO. Beginning January 1, 2015 and continuing through and including January 1, 2024, the amount of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP will increase annually on that date by the lesser of (i) one percent (1%) of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on such December 31, (ii) 520,000 shares of common stock, or (iii) a number of shares as determined by the board of directors prior to the beginning of each year, which shall be the lesser of (i) or (ii) above. For 2016, the common stock available for issuance under the ESPP increased by 184,927 shares of common stock.             18             Stock-Based Compensation        The following table reflects stock-based compensation expense recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (in thousands):             As of June 30, 2016, there was total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options of approximately $23.4 million. This cost is expected to be recognized over a period of 2.7 years . As of June 30, 2016, there was total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSU's of approximately $2.6 million. This cost is expected to be recognized over a period of 3.8 years.                    19             
ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
       You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section of this report entitled "Risk factors."        Overview        We are a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics targeting chronic disorders of the central nervous system ("CNS"). We seek to achieve this by enhancing the pharmacokinetic profiles of approved drugs to create novel therapeutics for use alone and in fixed-dose combination products. Our business strategy is twofold. We intend to develop and commercialize our wholly-owned products. In addition, we may form partnerships with companies that have an already established CNS market presence.        Our therapeutic programs address the following indications : levodopa-induced dyskinesia ("LID") associated with Parkinson's disease ("PD"), walking impairment in multiple sclerosis ("MS"), epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease .        Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes a variety of symptoms, such as tremors, rigidity, slowed movements , and postural instability. The most commonly prescribed treatments for PD are levodopa-based therapies. With these medicines, patients initially receive relief from symptoms of PD for much of the day. This period of relief is known as ON time. As the effects of levodopa wear off, the symptoms of PD return. This is known as OFF time. PD impacts over 800,000 people in the United States, while motor complications affect about 400,000 of these patients , and LID occurs in about 150,000 patients. LID can occur at the onset of levodopa initiation; it eventually occurs in approximately 90 percent of patients who have had PD for 10 years. There are no medicines approved in the United States for the treatment of LID .         We have substantially completed a clinical development program with ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID, including a positive Phase 2/3 study, two positive Phase 3 trials and a fully-enrolled and ongoing open-label safety study. Results from both Phase 3 studies demonstrated a statistically significant improvement for patients who received ADS-5102 versus placebo as assessed by the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale. In both Phase 3 studies, a statistically significant increase in ON time without troublesome LID was observed, as was a statistically significant decrease in OFF time versus placebo , a key secondary endpoint .  The types of adverse events ("AEs") reported with ADS-5102 were consistent with the known safety profile of amantadine, and the safety results were consistent across trials. In 2016, we plan to submit our first New Drug Application ("NDA") for ADS-5102 (amantadine hydrochloride ) extended-release capsules for the treatment of LID.        We are also developing ADS-5102 for the treatment of walking impairment in patients with MS, another CNS disorder , afflicting approximately 275,000 Americans. According to a 2013 survey of MS in America, approximately 75 percent of individuals with MS experience clinically significant walking impairment .        In June 2016, we reported positive data from our Phase 2 study of ADS-5102 for the treatment of walking impairment in MS. A key walking assessment was the timed 25-foot walk test, a well-established outcome measure. At four weeks, a statistically significant placebo-adjusted improvement in walking speed was seen in the patients on ADS-5102. The types of AEs reported with ADS-5102 were consistent with the known safety profile of amantadine.              20              We are also developing  another molecule, ADS-4101, for the treatment of partial onset seizures in epilepsy . There are approximately 2.2 million Americans living with epilepsy, a disease where seizure control is difficult to achieve. ADS-410 1 is an enhanced version of an approved anti-epileptic and is expected to enter clinical testing in 2016.    In 2012, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited ("Forest Laboratories" or "Forest"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc .  T wo commercially available medicines have resulted from the partnership : Namzaric  (memantine hydrochloride extended-release and donepezil hydrochloride) capsules and Namenda XR  (memantine hydrochloride) extended-release capsules, launched in May2015 and June2013, respectively , for an indication relating to Alzheimer's disease. We expect to begin receiving royalties on net sales of Namenda XR in 2018 and Namzaric in 2020 .    Financial operations overview    Summary    Our revenue to date has been generated primarily from license, milestone, and development revenue pursuant to our license agreement with Forest. We have not generated any commercial product revenue. As of June 30, 2016 , we had an accumulated deficit of $92.9 million . Although we reported net income in each of the years ended December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, this was primarily due to the recognition of revenue pursuant to our license agreement with Forest. There are no further milestone payments to be earned under our license agreement with Forest. We cannot assure you that we will receive additional license revenue in the future. We incurred significant losses in the first half of 2016, in 2015, and prior to 2012 , and expect to incur significant and increasing losses in the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates into later stages of development and, if approved, commercialization.        We expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we continue to advance our product candidates through clinical development. In addition, we plan to commercialize ADS-5102, if approved, and potentially other wholly-owned product candidates by developing a commercial organization, including a sales force targeting neurologists and movement disorder specialists in the United States, and possibly through distribution agreements and license agreements with CNS-focused pharmaceutical companies. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development and commercialization , we are unable to predict the timing or amount of expenses incurred or when, or if, we will be able to achieve sustained profitability.        Under our agreement with Forest, beginning in May2020, we are entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low to mid-teens for sales of Namzaric in the United States. In addition, we are also entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low to mid-single digits from Forest for sales of Namenda XR in the United States beginning in June2018 ; however, we do not expect the Namenda XR royalties will make a significant financial contribution to our business. Pursuant to the agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront license fee of $65.0million in 2012, which we recognized on a straight-line basis from November2012 to February2013. We also earned and received additional cash payments totaling $95.0 million upon achievement by Forest of certain development and regulatory milestones, which we recognized in 2013 and 2014.        Prior to our initial public offering of our common stock, or IPO, in April2014, we had raised an aggregate of approximately $87.2million through the sale of convertible preferred stock and $1.0 million through the exercise of preferred stock warrants. In 2014, we issued and sold 3,081,371 shares of common stock in our IPO and received net proceeds of approximately $42.6 million, which included partial exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares and after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. In connection with the completion of our IPO, all convertible preferred stock converted into common stock. On June1, 2015, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement, pursuant to which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering value of up to $25.0 million. As of June 30, 2016 , we had issued 509,741 shares of common stock and raised net proceeds of $9.7 million under the Sales Agreement. In January 2016, we raised $61.8 million from the sale of 2,875,000 shares of common stock in a follow-on public offering.         21                 As of June 30, 2016 , we had cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities of $158.0 million.        Revenue        We have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales to date. Our revenue to date has been generated primarily from non-refundable upfront license payments, milestone payments, reimbursements for research and development expenses and full-time equivalents assigned under our license agreement with Forest, and to a lesser degree reimbursement for research and development expenses from NIH grants and government contracts. We do not expect to recognize any further milestone payments under our license agreement with Forest, while reimbursements for full-time equivalents assigned to the license agreement are expected to remain at modest levels in future periods. Beginning in May2020, we will be entitled to receive royalties in the low to mid-teens from Forest for sales of Namzaric in the United States and in June2018, we will be entitled to receive royalties in the low to mid-single digits for sales of Namenda XR in the United States. We were also awarded a continuation of an NIH grant for $1.0 million in August2014, which we will administer, but conduct through subcontractors.        Research and development expenses        Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research, such as the discovery and development of our wholly-owned product candidates, as well as the development of product candidates pursuant to our agreement with Forest. We recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred.        Research and development expenses consist of:               fees paid to clinical investigators, clinical trial sites, consultants, and vendors, including clinical research organizations, or CROs, in conjunction with implementing, conducting, and monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating clinical trial data, including all related fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening fees, laboratory work, and statistical compilation and analysis;              expenses related to production of clinical supplies, including fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs;              expenses related to compliance with regulatory requirements;              other consulting fees paid to third parties; and              employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation.       The following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):                  22             The program-specific expenses summarized in the table above include costs directly attributable to our product candidates. Other research and development expenses include costs not allocated to a specific program. We allocate research and development salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, and indirect costs to our product candidates on a program-specific basis, and we include these costs in the program-specific expenses. We have reallocated certain other research and development expenses to program-specific expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 in order to consistently classify our product candidate expenses between periods.        The largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities, including the clinical development of our product candidates. We anticipate incur ring significant research and development expenses as we continue our clinical trials for ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID and walking impairment associated with MS, ADS-4101 for treatment of epilepsy, and potentially initiate additional clinical-stage programs in more indications or for future product candidates. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain FDA approval is costly and time consuming. We consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long-term success. The actual probability of success for each product candidate and clinical program may be affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to the quality of the product candidate, early clinical data, investment in the program, competition, manufacturing capability, and commercial viability. Furthermore, in the past we have entered into licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize our product candidates, and we may enter into additional licensing arrangements or collaborations in the future. In situations in which third parties have control over the clinical development of a product candidate, the estimated completion dates are largely under the control of such third parties and not under our control. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates, if any, will be subject to future licensing or collaboration arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates.        General and administrative expenses, net        General and administrative expenses, net consist primarily of personnel and related benefit costs, facilities, professional services, insurance, and public company related expenses, reduced by reimbursement from Forest for external costs related to supporting prosecution and litigation of intellectual property rights under our license agreement. We anticipate our general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to support our clinical and potentially commercial-stage programs. If ADS-5102 is approved by the FDA, we plan to market and sell through our own sales force targeting neurologists and movement disorder specialists in the United States, which will further increase general and administrative expenses , and possibly through distribution agreements and license agreements with CNS-focused pharmaceutical companies .        Interest and other income (expense), net        Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest received on our investments.        Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates        Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We have discussed the development, selection , and disclosure      23             of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no significant and material changes in our critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2016 , as compared to those disclosed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 .        Results of operations        Comparison of the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015         The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except percentages):             Revenue        Revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, compared to $0.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. Revenue for both periods in 2016 and 2015 was primarily related to reimbursement of certain expenses as provided for in our license agreement with Forest, as well as from government contracts.        Research and development expenses        Research and development expenses increased by $0.5 million, or 6% to $9.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 . There were increased expenses to support the preparation of the new drug application for ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID , in addition expenses related to preclinical work associated with ADS-4101 for the treatment of epilepsy (partial onset seizures ) . The increase was offset by a decrease in research and development expenses attributed to the conclusion of two P hase 3 clinical trials for ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID.  Included in research and development expenses was stock-based compensation expense, which was unchanged at $0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 , compared to the same period in the prior year.         Research and development expenses increased by $0.5 million , or 3% to $16.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016  from $16.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 . We were engaged in increased  effort s to support the preparation of the new drug application for ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID , in addition expenses related to preclinical work associated with ADS-4101 for the treatment of epilepsy (partial onset seiz u r e s) in the first six months of 2016 as compared to the prior year . The increase was offset by a decrease in research and development expenses attributed to the concl usion of two P hase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of LID. Included in research and development expenses was stock-based compensation expense, which was $1.4 million compared to $1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively .             24             General and administrative expenses, net        General and administrative expenses, net, increased by $2.2 million, or 38% , to $8.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $5.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 . The increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increase d costs associated with establishing commercial capabilities in anticipation of the commercial launch of ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID, pending regulatory approval , including an increase in headcount-related expenses. We anticipate general and administrative expenses will increase through the remaining quarters of 2016, reflecting increased investment in pre-commercial activities. General and administrative expenses also included stock-based compensation expense of $1.9 million compared to $1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.        General and administrative expenses, net, increased by $3.9 million, or 37% , to $14.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $10.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 . The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to in creased costs associated with establishing commercial capabilities in anticipation of the commercial launch of ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID, pending regulatory approval, including an increase in headcount-related expenses. General and administrative expenses also included stock-based compensation expense of $3.8 million compared to $3.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.        Interest and other income, net        Interest and other income, net, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.2 million  and $0.3 million, respectively, compared to $0.1 and $0.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 . Net interest income is primarily due to interest income earned on investments.        Liquidity, capital resources and plan of operation        We have funded our operations primarily through $160.0 million of payments received pursuant to our license agreement with Forest, $88.2 million sales of convertible preferred stock and warrants, and $114.1 million pursuant to sales of our common stock. In April 2014, we completed our IPO and raised net proceeds of $42.6 million, including the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares. On June1, 2015, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., pursuant to which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering value of up to $25.0 million. As of June 30, 2016 , we had issued 509,741 shares of common stock and raised net proceeds of $9.7 million under the Sales Agreement. On January 6, 2016, we completed a follow-on public offering of 2,875,000 shares of common stock, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 375,000 shares of common stock, at an offering price of $23.00 per share. Proceeds from the follow-on public offering were approximately $61.8 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering-related transaction costs.        We have not generated any revenue from the sale of products. We incurred losses and generated negative cash flows from operations since inception through the year ended December31, 2011. Although we recognized a profit and positive cash flow in 2014, 2013, and 2012 as a result of payments received pursuant to our license agreement with Forest, we received our final milestone payment from Forest in December2014 .  W e do not currently receive any royalties from Forest, nor do we have other license agreements or collaborations from which we might expect milestone or royalty revenue. Consequently, we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future. Our principal sources of liquidity were our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, which totaled $158.0 million as of June 30, 2016 .        We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements, including operations related to the continued development of ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID, for at least the next 12 months. However, it is possible that we will not achieve the progress that we expect, because the actual costs and timing of drug development, particularly clinical studies, and regulatory approvals are difficult to      25             predict, subject to substantial risks and delays, and often vary depending on the particular indication and development strategy.        We expect to continue significant spending in connection with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, particularly for ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID, as well as other indications. In order to continue these activities, we may decide to raise additional funds through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, asset sales, and other marketing and distribution arrangements . Sufficient additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available in the future, we may need to delay, reduce the scope of, or put on hold our clinical studies, research and development programs, or commercialization efforts.        The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):             Net cash used in operating activities was $24.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $24.0 million for the same period in the prior year. Net loss of $30.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 included net non-cash adjustments of $5.9 million, which consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of $5.2 million.
