Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)   1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business  A10 Networks, Inc. (together with our subsidiaries, the "Company", "we", "our" or "us") was incorporated in California in 2004 and reincorporated in Delaware in March 2014. We are headquartered in San Jose, California and have wholly-owned subsidiaries throughout the world including Asia and Europe.

Basis of Presentation  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of A10 Networks, Inc., and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain notes or other financial information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP can be condensed or omitted. These financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as our annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our financial information. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December31, 2016 or for any other interim period or for any other future year. The balance sheet as of December31, 2015 has been derived from audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December31, 2015 , which are included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 1, 2016.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Those estimates and assumptions affect revenue recognition and deferred revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, sales return reserve, valuation of inventory, fair value of marketable securities, contingencies and litigation, acquisition purchase price allocations, and determination of fair value of stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements; therefore, actual results could differ from management's estimates.  6 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Marketable securities  We classify our investments in debt and equity securities as available-for-sale and record these investments at fair value. Investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents, while all other investments are classified as current assets based on their availability for use in current operations. Unrealized gains or losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method, and are reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Realized gains or losses and charges for other-than-temporary declines in value, if any, on marketable securities are reported in interest income and other income (expense), net as incurred.  We regularly review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indicators of possible impairment. Investments are considered impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. If the cost of an individual investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, we will record an impairment charge and establish a new cost basis in the investment.  Goodwill  Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized for accounting purposes. We review goodwill for possible impairment annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying amount may not be recoverable. For annual goodwill impairment test in all periods to date, we operate under one reporting unit and the fair value of our reporting unit has been determined by our enterprise value. When assessing goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not (i.e.greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required. Examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than the carrying amount include macro-economic conditions such as (i) a significant adverse change in customer demand or a severe deterioration in the entity's operating environment and market conditions; (ii) entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or (iii) other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or there will be a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.  If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. The first step requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with our carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than our carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit, and the second step of the impairment test is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. Under the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.  Intangible Assets  Intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology, patent and acquired customer relationships resulting from acquisitions. Intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from five to ten years.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  We periodically evaluate whether changes have occurred that would render our long-lived assets not recoverable. If such circumstances arise, we use an estimate of the undiscounted value of expected future operating cash flows to determine whether the long-lived assets are impaired. If the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, the resulting impairment charge to be recorded is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over the fair value of such assets, with the fair value generally determined based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows. 7   There have been no other changes to the significant accounting policies described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2016, that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.  Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in high-credit quality financial instruments maintained with banks and financial institutions. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are financially sound and, accordingly, are subject to minimal credit risk. In some instances, deposits held with banks and financial institutions may be in excess of insured limits provided on such deposits.  Our accounts receivable are unsecured and represent amounts due to us based on contractual obligations of our customers. We mitigate credit risk in respect to accounts receivable by performing periodic credit evaluations of our customers to assess the probability of accounts receivable collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction experience with the customer, evaluation of their credit history, limiting the credit extended and review of the invoicing terms of the contract. We generally do not require our customers to provide collateral to support accounts receivable.  Significant customers, including distribution channel partners and direct customers, are those which represent more than 10% of our total revenue for each period presented or our gross accounts receivable balance as of each respective balance sheet date. Revenue from our significant customers as a percentage of our total revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:   * represents less than 10% of total revenue  As of June30, 2016 , one distribution channel partner (Customer A) accounted for 13% of our total gross accounts receivable. As of December31, 2015 , no customer accounted for 10% or more of our total gross accounts receivable.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (" FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, Leases  (Topic 842). This new accounting standard primarily requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets but record expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and the timing of adoption.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid in capital pools. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee's shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and the timing of adoption.  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which provides new guidance on the recognition of revenue and states that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised 8 goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The original effective date of this accounting standard was annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date , which deferred the effective date of the new accounting standard. This updated standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018.  In March and April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) and ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. These accounting updates provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to ASC No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . ASU No. 2016-08 and ASU No. 2016-10 must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, ASU No. 2016-08 and ASU No. 2016-10 on our financial statements and method of adoption.  There have been no other recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the six months ended June 30, 2016 , as compared to the recent accounting pronouncements described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 1, 2016, that are of significance or potential significance to us.  2. Marketable Securities and Fair Value Measurements  Marketable Securities  As of June30, 2016 , the estimated fair value of our marketable securities, classified as available for sale, are as follows (in thousands):   For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 , realized gains were immaterial. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 , we did not reclassify any amount to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains or losses. We did not have any marketable securities as of December 31, 2015.  The following table summarizes the contractual maturities of our marketable securities as of June30, 2016 (in thousands):   All available-for-sale securities have been classified as current, based on management's ability to use the funds in current operations.  9 Marketable securities in an unrealized loss position as of June30, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands):   As of June30, 2016 , no marketable securities were in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than twelve months. We do not intend to sell any of these investments, and it is not more likely than not, that we would be required to sell these investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. As a result, there is no other-than-temporary impairment for these marketable securities as of June30, 2016 .  Fair Value Measurements  Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Our cash equivalents, which include money market funds, are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Marketable Securities are comprised of Certificates of Deposit, Corporate Securities, Commercial Paper and Asset-backed securities and we measure the fair value at the measurement date using the three-tier fair value hierarchy as described below. Accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment.  Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:  Level I -Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;  Our Level I assets consist of highly liquid money market funds that are included in cash and cash equivalents.  Level II -Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities;  Our Level II assets consist of Certificates of Deposit, Corporate Securities, Commercial Paper and Asset-backed securities.  Level III-Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.  We did not have any Level III assets or liabilities as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 . 10  The following table sets forth the fair value of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on a recurring basis, by level, within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):   3. Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations Components  Inventory  Components of inventory as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 are shown below (in thousands):   Property and Equipment, net  Components of property and equipment, net as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 are shown below (in thousands):   Depreciation and amortization on our property and equipment for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.8 million and $2.2 million . Depreciation and amortization on our property and equipment for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3.7 million and $4.7 million .  11  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Activity related to goodwill for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands):   Purchased intangible assets, net consisted of the following (in thousands):   Total future amortization expense for purchased intangible assets that have finite lives, based on our existing intangible assets and their current estimated useful lives as of June 30, 2016, is as follows (in thousands):   Accrued Liabilities  Accrued liabilities as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 consists of the following (in thousands):    12 Deferred Revenue  Deferred revenue as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 consists of the following (in thousands):     4. Credit Facility  In September 2013, we entered into a credit agreement with Royal Bank of Canada, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. as lenders. The credit agreement provides a three -year, $35.0 million , revolving credit facility, which includes a maximum $10.0 million letter of credit facility. We are required to pay quarterly facility fees of 0.45% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility. We had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 . The revolving credit facility expires on September 30, 2016.  At our option, the revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum based on either (i) an alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.50% depending on our total leverage ratio, or (ii) the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, based on one, two, three or six month interest periods plus a margin ranging from 2.75% to 3.50% depending on our total leverage ratio. The alternate base rate is equal to the greatest of (i) the Royal Bank of Canada's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus a margin equal to 0.50% and (iii) the Eurodollar rate for a one month interest period plus a margin equal to 1.00% .  Our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a security interest on substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. The credit agreement contains customary financial and non-financial covenants, which are described in Note 4, Credit Facility of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2016. We were in compliance with all financial and nonfinancial covenants under the revolving credit facility as of June30, 2016 .  5. Commitments and Contingencies  Legal Proceedings  From time to time, we may be party or subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to intellectual property matters. Some of these proceedings involve claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, we have not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, if any, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or amounts cannot be reasonably estimated.  On January 29, 2015, the Company, the members of our Board of Directors, our Chief Financial Officer, and the underwriters of our March 21, 2014 initial public offering ("IPO") were named as defendants in a putative class action lawsuit alleging violations of the federal Securities Act of 1933 filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, captioned City of Warren Police and Fire Retirement System v. A10 Networks, Inc., et al., 1-15-CV-276207. Several substantially identical lawsuits were subsequently filed in the same court, bringing the same claims against the same defendants, captioned Arkansas Teacher Retirement System v. A10 Networks, Inc., et al., 1-15-CV-278575 (filed March 25, 2015) and Kaveny v. A10 Networks, Inc., et al., 1-15-CV-279006 (filed April 6, 2015). On May 29, 2015, the aforementioned putative class actions were consolidated under the caption In re A10 Networks, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, 1-15-CV-276207.  On April 6, 2016, all parties entered into a memorandum of understanding reflecting an agreement in principle to settle all claims against all defendants asserted in the action and providing that we will make a payment of $0.8 million , net of 13 the expected proceeds of insurance policies.The parties subsequently executed a stipulation of settlement, dated June 30, 2016, and filed a motion with the Court seeking preliminary approval of the settlement, which is scheduled to be heard on September 9, 2016. The settlement releases all claims asserted against all defendants and includes the dismissal of all claims against all defendants without any liability or wrongdoing attributed to them. The settlement remains subject to stockholder notice, court approval and other customary conditions.  On June 24, 2015, our directors and certain of our officers were named as defendants in a putative derivative lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, captioned Hornung v. Chen, et al. , 1-15-CV-282286 (the "Derivative Action"). We were also named as a nominal defendant.The complaint seeks to allege breaches of fiduciary duties and other related claims, arising out of allegations that our officers and directors caused us to infringe patents and intellectual property, improperly approved the settlement of prior litigation, failed to adopt and implement effective internal controls, and caused us to issue false and misleading statements in connection with our IPO. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other equitable relief.On May 24, 2016, all parties entered into a memorandum of understanding reflecting an agreement in principle to settle all claims against all defendants asserted in the action, which provides that we implement certain corporate governance measures following final settlement approval. The settlement releases all claims asserted against all defendants and includes the dismissal of all claims against all defendants without any liability or wrongdoing attributed to them. The settlement remains subject to execution of a formal settlement agreement, court approval and other customary conditions.  Lease Obligations and Other Commitments  We lease various operating spaces in the United States, Asia, and Europe under non-cancelable operating lease arrangements that expire on various dates through February 2020. These arrangements require us to pay certain operating expenses, such as taxes, repairs, and insurance and contain renewal and escalation clauses. We recognize rent expense under these arrangements on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  We have entered into agreements with some of our customers and channel partners that contain indemnification provisions in the event of claims alleging that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. Other guarantees or indemnification arrangements include guarantees of product and service performance and standby letters of credit for lease facilities and corporate credit cards. We have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification and guarantee provisions and our guarantees and indemnification arrangements have not had any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements to date.  6. Appcito Acquisition  On June 23, 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Appcito, Inc. ("Appcito"), a privately held company engaged in providing a unified set of services for applications deployed on cloud infrastructure with facilities located in Santa Clara, California and Bangalore, India. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Appcito. This acquisition enhances our position as a comprehensive secure application services leader, and it represents a strategic step in our vision to help our customers become more secure and agile as they bridge traditional and cloud application environments.  The total purchase consideration was $6.5 million . The fair value of the total purchase consideration was $6.3 million , which consisted of $5.0 million in cash consideration, less a holdback of $0.7 million to cover any indemnification claims within the next twelve months, and 227,404 unregistered shares of our common stock with an aggregated fair value of $1.3 million . We allocated the total purchase consideration to the net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date.  The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired (in thousands):  14 Developed technology is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of five years . Goodwill of $1.2 million was recognized as part of this acquisition is attributable primarily to the expected synergies and other benefits from this acquisition including adding to our existing momentum around providing secure application service solutions that meet several key demands like application analytics, visibility, and centralized control. The acquisition is expected to introduce secure application service offerings that span traditional data centers, private clouds, public clouds, and hybrid clouds.  We incurred approximately $0.2 million in legal, accounting and other professional fees related to this acquisition, all of which were expensed during the three months ended June 30, 2016.  We do not consider the acquisition of Appcito to be material to our results of operations or financial position, and therefore, we are not presenting pro-forma financial information of combined operations.  This acquisition was taxable for income tax purposes, and the acquired assets have been recorded at fair value for both book and income tax purposes. Therefore, no deferred taxes have been recorded. The goodwill of $1.2 million and the $0.2 million of acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over 15 years for income tax purposes.  7. Equity Award Plans  Equity Incentive Plans  2014 Equity Incentive Plan  Our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") was adopted by our Board of Directors and approved by our stockholders in March 2014. The 2014 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and consultants. In addition, effective as of June10,2015, our Board of Directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, an amendment and restatement of our 2014Plan, which increased the number of shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan by the number of shares available from the 2008 Plan that were canceled or otherwise forfeited or repurchased by us after March20,2014. A maximum of 8,310,566 shares may become available from the 2008 Plan for issuance under the 2014 Plan.  As of December31, 2015 , we had 3,364,304 shares available for future grant. Annually, the shares authorized for the Plan will increase by the least of (i) 8,000,000 shares, (ii) 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock on the last day of our immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii)such other amount as determined by our Board of Directors. On January1, 2016, the number of shares in the 2014 Plan was increased by 4,851,535 shares, which consisted of 3,211,211 shares, representing 5% of the prior year end's common stock outstanding and 1,640,324 shares for awards under our 2008 Plan that have been canceled, forfeited or repurchased by us between March 21, 2014 and December 31, 2015.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016 , we granted 672,000 stock options and 3,604,561 stock awards under the 2014 Plan to our employees, directors and consultants. As of June30, 2016 , we had 4,553,483 shares available for future grant, excluding shares eligible to be added from the 2008 Plan as a result of awards that have been canceled, forfeited or repurchased by us after December 31, 2015.  As of June30, 2016 , 189,016 shares of our common stock were eligible to be added to the 2014 Plan share reserve which represents awards under our 2008 Plan that have been canceled, forfeited or repurchased by us during the six months ended June 30, 2016 .  2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  The 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "2014 Purchase Plan") was adopted by our Board of Directors and approved by our stockholders in March 2014.  As of December31, 2015 , we had 542,030 shares available for future purchase. Under the provisions of the 2014 Purchase Plan, on the first day of each fiscal year, starting with January1, 2015, the number of shares in the reserve will increase by the lesser of (i) 3,500,000 shares, (ii) 1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii)such other amount as determined by our Board of Directors or other committee administering the 2014 Purchase Plan. On January 1, 2016, the common shares reserved for future purchase was increased by 642,242 shares in accordance with the provisions of the 2014 Purchase Plan. In June 2016, our Board of Directors adopted, and our stockholders approved an amendment to our 2014 Purchase Plan which removed the automatic annual share increase and increased the number of shares available for issuance under the 2014 Purchase Plan by 4,000,000 shares. 15  The participants of the Purchase Plan purchased 552,554 shares during the first six months of 2016, and as of June30, 2016 , we had 631,718 shares available for future purchase, excluding the 4,000,000 shares added to the 2014 Purchase Plan in June 2016.  Stock-based Compensation  Stock-based compensation is based on the estimated fair value of awards, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognized over the requisite service period. The following is a summary of stock-based compensation for stock-based awards granted under the 2014 Plan, the 2008 Plan, and employee stock purchases under the 2014 Purchase Plan recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):  __________________________________________ (1) Our 2014 Purchase Plan generally provides twenty-four month offering periods which consist of four six-month purchase periods. We record periodic stock-based compensation expense based on estimated contributions determined at the beginning of each offering period and record purchase adjustments for the difference between the estimated and actual contributions at the end of each purchase period. For the purchase period ended on May 20, 2016, the actual contributions were significantly lower than the estimated contributions due to lower stock price which caused more employees to reach the maximum purchase contribution limit and therefore resulted in negative stock-based compensation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.  As of June30, 2016 , we had $33.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options, unvested stock awards and 2014 Purchase Plan purchases. This unamortized stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.  Determination of Fair Value  We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of stock options and stock purchases and generally recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  The determination of the fair value on the date of grant is affected by the estimated underlying common stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends.  The fair value of the stock options and employee stock purchases were determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and assumptions discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine.    Expected Term . We estimate the expected life of options based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post-vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option. The expected term for the 2014 Purchase Plan is based on the term of the purchase period.  16   Risk-Free Interest Rate . The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected terms of stock options and shares to be issued under the 2014 Purchase Plan.    Expected Volatility . Due to the limited trading history of our own common stock, we determined the share price volatility factor based on a combination of the historical volatility of our own common stock and the historical volatility of our peer group.    Dividend Rate . The expected dividend was assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to do so.  The grant date fair value of RSUs that have time or performance based vesting conditions contingent upon meeting financial and operational targets are equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date.  We estimate the grant date fair value of RSUs that have market based vesting conditions using the Monte Carlo simulation method.  Stock Option Activity  The following table summarizes our stock option activity and related information as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 (in thousands, except for years and per share amounts):  __________________________________________ (1) Common shares granted under the 2008 Plan and canceled after March 20, 2014, are reallocated to the 2014Plan's share reserve as they become available for issuance under the 2014Plan. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, 189,016 shares related to canceled stock options were eligible to be reallocated to the 2014 Plan share reserve.  As of June30, 2016 , the aggregate intrinsic value represents the excess of the closing price of our common stock of $6.47 over the exercise price of the outstanding in-the-money options.  The following table provides information pertaining to our stock options for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except weighted-average fair values):   17 The estimated grant-date fair value of our stock options issued to employees was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, based on the following assumptions:   Stock Award Activity  We have granted time-based stock awards ("RSUs") to our employees, directors and consultants and performance-based stock awards ("PSUs") and market performance-based stock awards ("MSUs") to certain company executives.  A summary of stock award activities, including RSUs, PSUs and MSUs during the six months ended June 30, 2016 , is as follows (in thousands, except years and per share amounts):   During the six months ended June 30, 2016 , we granted 547,000 PSUs with performance-based conditions contingent upon meeting certain financial and operational targets. These PSUs are also subject to service condition vesting requirements with 25% of the eligible PSUs scheduled to vest on each of the first, second, third and fourth year anniversary of the PSU grant date, subject to continued service by the award holder.  We granted MSUs covering 540,000 shares and 40,000 shares of our common stock to certain company executives during 2014 and 2015, all of which were outstanding as of June30, 2016 . These MSUs will vest if the closing price of our common stock remains above certain predetermined target prices for 20 consecutive trading days within a 4 -year period following the award's grant date, subject to continued service by the award holder.  The aggregate intrinsic value is the amount that would have been received by the unit holders had all RSUs been vested and released on June30, 2016 . This amount will fluctuate based on the fair market value of our stock. As of June 30, 2016, the aggregated intrinsic value for RSUs, MSUs and PSUs was $41.1 million with a weighted-average remaining service period of 2.8 years.  18 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  The fair value of the option component of the 2014 Purchase Plan awards was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:   8. Net Loss Per Share  The following table sets forth the computation of our basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share data):   The following weighted-average outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because including them would have been antidilutive (in thousands):    9. Income Taxes  We recorded income tax expense of $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 , which primarily consisted of foreign taxes. We recorded income tax expense of $0.3 million for each of the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 , which primarily consisted of foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their respective tax bases using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. 19  We believe it is more likely than not that our federal and state net deferred tax assets will not be fully realized. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. A valuation allowance is recorded for loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. and certain foreign net deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2016. We will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net federal, state and certain foreign deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support recoverability of our deferred tax assets.  We had $2.9 million and $2.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 . We do not anticipate a material change to our unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months. Unrecognized tax benefits may change during the next twelve months for items that arise in the ordinary course of business.  Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as part of our income tax provision in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. All tax years remain open and are subject to future examinations by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are not under examination in any jurisdiction.  10. Segment Information  Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenue by geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Accordingly, we have a single reportable segment and operating segment structure.  The following table represents revenue by geographic areas based on customers' location, as determined by their ship to addresses (in thousands):   No other geographic regions comprised 10% or greater of our revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 .  Geographical information relating to our long-lived assets which include property and equipment, net and intangible assets, net as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 was as follows (in thousands):   11. Related-Party Transactions  An affiliate of one of our significant stockholders is also acting as a reseller of our products. On May 27, 2015, the significant stockholder reduced its ownership of our common stock, and ceased to be a related party. During the three and six 20 months ended June 30, 2015 , we recognized $1.6 million and $3.0 million of revenue from this reseller while it was a related party.  21

Overview  We are a leading provider of application networking and network security technologies. Our solutions enable enterprises, service providers, Web giants and government organizations to accelerate, secure and optimize the performance of their data center applications and secure their users, applications and infrastructure from internet, web and network threats at scale. Our products are built on our Advanced Core Operating System ("ACOS") platform of advanced network technologies, which is designed to enable our products to deliver substantially greater performance and security relative to prior generation application networking products. Our software based ACOS architecture also provides the flexibility that enables us to expand our business to offer additional products to solve a growing array of networking and security challenges arising from increased Internet cloud and mobile computing.  We currently offer four software based advanced application networking and network security solutions to address end-customer needs, including Application Delivery Controllers ("ADC") to optimize web and back-office application performance, Carrier Grade Network Address Translation ("CGN") to provide network address and protocol translation services for service provider networks, Threat Protection System ("TPS") for network-wide multi-vector DDoS security protection, and Convergent Firewall ("CFW") for protecting data centers and mobile infrastructure, improving web security, and encrypting site-to-site communications. Our solutions are cloud-ready and available in a variety of form factors as optimized hardware appliances, in the cloud as software, and as virtual appliances.  We derive revenue from sales of products and related support services. Products revenue is generated primarily by sales of hardware appliances with perpetual licenses to our embedded software solutions. We also derive revenue from licenses to, or subscription services for, software-only versions of our solutions. We generate services revenue primarily from sales of maintenance and support contracts. Our end-customers predominantly purchase maintenance and support in conjunction with purchases of our products. In addition, we also derive revenues from the sale of professional services.  We sell our products globally to service providers and enterprises that depend on data center applications and networks to generate revenue and manage operations efficiently. Our end-customers operate in a variety of industries, including telecommunications, technology, industrial, retail, financial, education and government. Since inception, our customer base has grown rapidly. As of June30, 2016 , we had sold products to approximately 5,000 customers across 79 countries.  We sell substantially all of our solutions through our high-touch sales organization as well as distribution channel partners, including distributors, value added resellers and system integrators, and fulfill nearly all orders globally through such partners. We believe this sales approach allows us to obtain the benefits of channel distribution, such as expanding our market coverage, while still maintaining face-to-face relationships with our end-customers. We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware products to original design manufacturers. We perform quality assurance and testing at our San Jose, Taiwan and Japan distribution centers, as well as at our manufacturers' locations.  During the first half of 2016, 55% of our total revenue was generated from the United States, 20% from Japan, and 25% from other geographical regions. During the first half of 2015, 55% of our total revenue was generated from the United States, 17% from Japan, and 28% from other geographical regions. Our enterprise customers accounted for 58% and 57% of our total revenue during the first half of 2016 and 2015. Our service provider customers accounted for 42% and 43% of our total revenue during the first half of 2016 and 2015.  As a result of the nature of our target market and the current stage of our development, a substantial portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of large end-customers, including service providers, in any period. Purchases from our ten largest end-customers accounted for approximately 35% of our total revenue in each of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Sales to these large end-customers have typically been characterized by large but irregular purchases with long sales cycles. The timing of these purchases and the delivery of the purchased products are difficult to predict. As a consequence, any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases, by or deliveries to, our largest end customers could materially impact our revenue and operating results in any quarterly period. This may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and make them difficult to predict.  As of June30, 2016 , we had $28.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $85.1 million of marketable securities. Cash provided by operating activities was $19.3 million in the first half of 2016 compared to $3.5 million of cash provided by operating activities in the same period of 2015. 23  We intend to continue to invest for long-term growth. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in our product development efforts to deliver new products and additional features in our current products to address customer needs. In addition, we expect to continue to expand our global sales and marketing organizations, expand our distribution channel partner programs and increase awareness of our solutions on a global basis. Additionally we will be investing in general and administrative resources to meet the requirements to operate as a public company. Our investments in growth in these areas may affect our short-term profitability.  Results of Operations  The following table provides a summary of our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 as derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I. Financial Information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (in thousands, except for percentages).    24        25 Revenue  Our products revenue primarily consists of revenue from sales of our hardware appliances upon which our software is installed. Such software includes our ACOS software platform plus one of our ADC, CGN, TPS or CFW solutions. Purchase of a hardware appliance includes a perpetual license to the included software. We recognize products revenue at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. As a percentage of revenue, our products revenue may vary from quarter to quarter based on, among other things, the timing of orders and delivery of products, cyclicality and seasonality, changes in currency exchange rates and the impact of significant transactions with unique terms and conditions.  We generate services revenue from sales of post contract support, or PCS, which is bundled with sales of products and professional services. We offer tiered PCS services under renewable, fee-based PCS contracts, primarily including technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts, and software upgrades on a when-and-if-released basis. We recognize services revenue ratably over the term of the PCS contract, which is typically one year, but can be up to five years.  A summary of our total revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands, except for percentages):     Total revenue increased by $9.6 million , or 20% , in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was comprised of a $5.5 million increase in products revenue and a $4.1 million increase in services revenue. Revenue from enterprise and service provider customers increased 16% and 26%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015.  26 Total revenue increased by $19.4 million , or 21% , in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015. This increase was comprised of an $11.3 million increase in products revenue and an $8.1 million increase in services revenue. Revenue from enterprise and service provider customers increased 22% and 20%, respectively, in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015.  Products revenue increased by $5.5 million , or 16% , and $11.3 million , or 18% , in the second quarter and the first half of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. These increases were primarily attributable to revenue increases from the United States, Japan and Asia Pacific, excluding Japan partially offset by lower products revenue from EMEA.  Services revenue increased by $4.1 million , or 29% , and $8.1 million , or 29% ,in the second quarter and the first half of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. These increases were primarily attributable to the increase in PCS sales in connection with our increasing installed customer base as well as increases in our professional services revenue. Over 95% of our end-customers purchase one of our maintenance service products when purchasing our hardware products. During the first half of 2016, services revenue recognized from our installed base with contracts existing prior to 2016 grew by 29% as compared to the first half of 2015 services revenue from our installed base with contracts existing prior to 2015.  During the second quarter of 2016, $31.3 million , or 55% , of total revenue was generated from the United States, which represents a 14% increase compared to the second quarter of 2015. During the first half of 2016, $60.9 million , or 55% , of total revenue was generated from the United States, which represents a 21% growth compared to the first half of 2015. These increases were primarily attributable to an overall increase in products revenue as well as higher PCS sales in connection with our increased installed customer base.  During the second quarter of 2016, $11.0 million , or 19% , of total revenue was generated from Japan, which represents a 66% increase compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher products revenue from enterprise customers and to a less extent an increase in PCS sales in connection with the increased customer base. During the first half of 2016, $21.8 million , or 19% , of total revenue was generated from Japan, which represents a 41% increase compared to the first half of 2015. This increase was primarily due to an overall increase in products revenue as well as higher PCS sales in connection with our increased installed customer base. In addition, total revenue from Japan during the second quarter and the first half of 2016 was increased by $0.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively, due to favorable currency exchange rates between the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar compared to the same periods in 2015.  Total revenues from Asia Pacific regions, excluding Japan, increased by $2.2 million , or 40% and $4.3 million , or 43% in the second quarter and the first half of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. These increases were primarily due to significant increase in products revenue resulting from our efforts to continue expanding our presence in these regions as well as higher PCS sales in connection with our increased installed customer base.  Total revenue from EMEA decreased by $1.0 million , or 14% , and $2.1 million or 16% , in the second quarter and the first half of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. These decreases were primarily attributable to decreases in products revenue resulting from reduced sales and weakness in the EMEA market overall partially offset by an increase in services revenue.   Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin  Cost of revenue  Cost of products revenue is primarily comprised of cost of third-party manufacturing services and cost of component inventory for the hardware component of our products. Cost of products revenue also includes warehouse personnel costs, shipping costs, inventory write-downs, certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs, and expenses associated with logistics and quality control.  Cost of services revenue is primarily comprised of personnel costs for our technical support, training and professional service teams. Cost of services revenue also includes the costs of inventory used to provide hardware replacements to end- customers under PCS contracts and certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs. 27  A summary of our cost of revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands, except for percentages):    Gross Margin  Gross margin may vary and be unpredictable from period to period due to a variety of factors. These may include the mix of revenue from each of our regions, the mix of our products sold within a period, discounts provided to customers, inventory write-downs and international currency exchange rates.  Our sales are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, however, in Japan they are denominated in Japanese yen. Changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen will therefore affect our revenue and gross margin. Any of the factors noted above can generate either a positive or negative impact on gross margin as compared to another period.  A summary of gross profit and gross margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands, except for gross margins and percentages):    28 Products gross margin decreased by 1.6% and 1.2% in the second quarter and first half of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to changes in product and geographic mix and an increase in inventory reserves.  Services gross margins increased by 2.0% and 1.8% in the second quarter and the first half of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily as a result of growth in services revenue partially offset by the impact of increases in cost of services. During the first half of 2016, services revenue recognized from our installed base with contracts existing prior to 2016 grew by 29% compared to the first half of 2015 for services revenue recognized from our installed base with contracts existing prior to 2015. The increase in cost of services was primarily due to increases in personnel related costs and professional services costs as a result of our investment to expand our service and support group in anticipation of future growth in our installed base.  Operating Expenses  Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative and litigation expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs which consist of wages, benefits, bonuses, and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation and travel expenses. We expect personnel costs to increase in absolute dollars as we hire new employees to continue to grow our business.  A summary of our operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands, except for percentages):    Sales and Marketing  Sales and marketing expenses are our largest functional category of total operating expenses. These expenses primarily consist of personnel costs related to our employees engaged in sales and marketing activities. Sales and marketing expenses also include the cost of marketing programs, trade shows, consulting services, promotional materials, demonstration equipment, depreciation and certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs.  Sales and marketing expenses increased by $1.8 million , or 7% , in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily attributable to a $2.0 million increase in personnel related costs and a $0.6 million increase in company meeting expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in professional services costs due to lower contractors and recruiting costs and a $0.3 million decrease in depreciation expense as a result of fully depreciated assets. The increase in personnel related costs was primarily attributable to increased salaries, benefits and sales commissions in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation due to a favorable expense adjustment related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "2014 Purchase Plan"). 29  Sales and marketing expenses increased by $4.1 million , or 8% , in the first half of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily attributable to a $4.8 million increase in personnel related costs and a $0.8 million increase in company meeting expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in professional services costs due to lower contractors and recruiting costs and a $0.7 million decrease in depreciation expense as a result of fully depreciated assets. The increase in personnel related costs was primarily attributable to increased salaries, benefits and sales commissions in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015.  We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organization and as we increase our sales presence in existing countries and expand into new countries.  Research and Development  Research and development efforts are focused on new product development and on developing additional functionality for our existing products. These expenses consist of personnel costs, and to a lesser extent, prototype materials, depreciation and certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs. We expense research and development costs as incurred.  Research and development expense increased by $0.8 million , or 6% , in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million increase in personnel related costs. The increase in personnel related costs in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in research and development headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation due to a favorable expense adjustment related to our 2014 Purchase Plan.  Research and development expense increased by $1.3 million , or 5% , in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to a $1.4 million increase in personnel related costs. The increase in personnel related costs in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in research and development headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation due to a favorable expense adjustment related to our 2014 Purchase Plan.  We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to develop new products and enhance our existing products.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, professional fees and office costs. General and administrative personnel costs include executive, finance, human resources, information technology, facility and legal (excluding litigation) related expenses. Professional fees consist primarily of fees for outside accounting, tax, legal, recruiting and other administrative services.  General and administrative expenses increased by $1.5 million , or 27% , in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to a $0.9 million increase in personnel related costs, a $0.7 million increase in bad debt expense and a $0.5 million increase in sales and use tax expense, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in professional services fees.  The increase in personnel related costs in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 was primarily a result of increased salaries and benefits. The decrease in professional services fees was primarily due to a decrease in contractor and consultant headcount in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 and a decrease in legal fees. In the second quarter of 2015, we completed several state sales tax registration processes and adjustments resulting from our reassessment of previously accrued sales and use tax liabilities which resulted in significantly lower sales and used tax for the period.  General and administrative expenses increased by $0.7 million , or 5% , in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to a $1.7 million increase in personnel related costs and a $0.6 million increase in sales and use tax expense due to the above mentioned factors, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in professional services fees.  30 The increase in personnel related costs in the first half of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily a result of higher headcount and increased salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation.  We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in the future.  Litigation and Settlement Expense  Litigation and settlement expense is comprised of legal expenses incurred related to litigation and, if applicable, charges for litigation reserves. Litigation expenses consist of professional fees incurred in defending ourselves against litigation matters and are expensed as incurred when professional services are provided. The litigation reserve, if any, consists of accruals we make related to estimated losses in pending legal proceedings. Litigation reserves, if any, are adjusted as we change our estimates or make payments in damages or settlements.  Litigation and settlement expense decreased by $0.8 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily attributable to less litigation related activity following the settlement of the class action lawsuit in the first quarter of 2016, and the settlement of the derivative lawsuit in the second quarter of 2016.  Litigation expense increased by $0.5 million in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, primarily attributable to litigation activity leading up and relating to the settlement of the class action and derivative lawsuits in the first half of 2016.  Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net  Interest income and other income (expense), net, increased by $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily consisting of a $1.1 million increase in foreign exchange gains and a $0.1 million increase in interest income. Interest income and other income (expense), net, increased by $1.4 million in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, primarily consisting of a $1.2 million increase in foreign exchange gains and a $0.3 million increase in interest income. The increase in foreign exchange gains was primarily due to the impact of favorable currency exchange rates of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar during the second quarter and the first half of 2016. The higher interest income was primarily attributable to increases in our cash, cash equivalents and our investment in marketable securities.  Provision for Income Taxes  We recorded income tax expense of $0.1 million and $0.2 million , respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 , which primarily consisted of foreign taxes. We recorded income tax expense of $0.3 million for each of the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 , which primarily consisted of foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their respective tax bases using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse.  We currently maintain a valuation allowance on federal and state deferred tax assets, and we will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of June30, 2016 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $28.6 million , including $3.2 million held outside the United States in our foreign subsidiaries, and $85.1 million of marketable securities. We currently do not have any plans to repatriate our earnings from our foreign operations. As of June30, 2016 , we had working capital of $84.8 million , accumulated deficit of $236.3 million and total stockholders' equity of $79.0 million .  As of June30, 2016 , our contractual obligations consist of capital leases, operating leases, purchase commitments, and other contractual obligations. There have been no material changes to these obligations outside the ordinary course of business during the six months ended June30, 2016 compared to the contractual obligations disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as described in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2016.  31 We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth and anticipate our investment will continue to increase in absolute dollars. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other available financial resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  In addition, as described in Note 5. Commitments and Contingencies in the condensed consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are currently, or may be from time to time be, involved in ongoing litigation. Any adverse settlements or judgments in any litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash balances and cash flows in the period in which such events occur.  Credit Agreement  In September 2013, we entered into a credit agreement with Royal Bank of Canada, acting as administrative agent and lender, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. as lenders. The credit agreement provides a three-year $35.0 million revolving credit facility, which includes a maximum $10.0 million letter of credit facility. The revolving credit facility expires on September 30, 2016. As of June30, 2016 , we had no outstanding balance on our credit facility and were in compliance with our covenants.  Statements of Cash Flows  The following table summarizes our cash flow related activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  Our cash provided by operating activities is driven primarily by sales of our products, management of working capital investments and, to a lesser extent, by up-front payments from end-customers under PCS contracts. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses, costs related to our facilities and litigation expenses. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on personnel and sales and marketing activities, our working capital requirements, and litigation expenses.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016 , cash provided by operating activities was $19.3 million , consisting of a net loss of $14.5 million , non-cash charges of $13.2 million and a $20.5 million cash increase resulting from changes in net operating assets and liabilities. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of $8.5 million in stock-based compensation expense, $3.7 million in depreciation and amortization expenses and $1.1 million in other non-cash items. The changes in our net operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to a $17.5 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $3.0 million increase in deferred revenue and a $2.8 million decrease in inventory, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a $0.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.  The decrease in accounts receivable in the first half of 2016 was primarily due to improved cash collections. The increase in deferred revenue was due to increase in PCS sales in connection with our increasing installed customer base. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was largely due to the timing of vendor invoice payments.  During the six months ended June 30, 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 million , consisting of a net loss of $23.7 million ; non-cash charges of $13.6 million and a $13.6 million cash increase resulting from changes in net 32 operating assets and liabilities. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily $8.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $4.7 million in depreciation and amortization. The changes in our net operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to an $8.6 million increase in deferred revenue, a $7.7 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $1.9 million decrease in inventory, partially offset by a $4.7 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  The increase in deferred revenue was due to timing of billings of support contracts and the increase in PCS sales in connection with our increasing installed customer base. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to improved cash collection in 2015 and the timing of billing as a higher portion of the December 31, 2014 outstanding accounts receivable were billed during the latter part of the quarter compared to the June 30, 2015 outstanding accounts receivable. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to increased consumption of existing inventory. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily attributable to a decrease in accrued compensation costs largely due to the payment of accrued commissions and bonuses and the timing of vendor invoice payments.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  During the six months ended June 30, 2016 , cash used in investing activities was $92.0 million , primarily consisting of $85.1 million of net purchases in marketable securities, $4.4 million payment for the acquisition of Appcito Inc. and $2.6 million for purchases of property and equipment.  During the six months ended June 30, 2015, cash used in investing activities was $1.8 million , primarily for purchases of property and equipment.  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $3.3 million and $2.6 million , respectively, primarily consisting of proceeds from common stock issuance under our equity incentive plans, net of repurchases of common stock.  Contractual Obligations  In September 2013, we entered into a credit agreement with Royal Bank of Canada, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. as lenders. The credit agreement provides a three-year $35.0 million revolving credit facility, which includes a maximum $10.0 million letter of credit facility. We have no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility as of June30, 2016 .  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of June30, 2016 , we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.  Goodwill  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. We review goodwill for possible impairment annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Triggering events that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or a severe deterioration in our operating environment and market conditions. These changes could affect the value of goodwill or a significant decrease in expected cash flows. We perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit 33 is less than our carrying amount. If we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than our carrying amount, we perform a two-step impairment test. The first step requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with our carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than our carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the second step of the impairment test is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. Under the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology, patent and acquired customer relationships resulting from acquisitions. Intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which ranges from five to ten years.  We review long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Triggering events that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to estimated results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends. We determine the recoverability of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the assets fair market value.  There were no other significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2016.
