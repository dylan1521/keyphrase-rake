AND SUBSIDIARIES Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) (in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) See notes to consolidated financial statements. 2 AV HOMES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands) (unaudited) See notes to consolidated financial statements. 3 AV HOMES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) March31, 2016 Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AV Homes, Inc. and all subsidiaries, partnerships and other entities in which AV Homes, Inc. ("AV Homes," "we," "us," "our," or "the Company") has a controlling interest. Our investments in unconsolidated entities in which we have less than a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method.The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules andregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for complete financial statements. These statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of AV Homes as of March31, 2016 and for all periods presented. These statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in AV Homes' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2015. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Beginning with our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the selling, general and administrative expenses related to homebuilding previously included in Homebuilding expenses have been combined with corporate general and administrative expenses and reclassified into a separate new line item called "Selling, general and administrative expenses" to enhance the visibility to our core homebuilding operations and conform with standard industry presentation.The selling, general and administrative expenses reclassified include commissions, other selling expenses and overhead incurred at the divisional level. For the quarter ended March 31, 2015, selling, general and administrative costs of $9.7 million that were previously presented in Homebuilding expenses are now included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, in accordance with adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest , our debt issuance costs are now presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability.This guidance was applied retrospectively and had the effect of reducing our Prepaid expenses and other assets and Senior notes, net balances in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2015, unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $5.9 million were previously presented in Prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and are now included as a reduction to Senior notes, net. Use of Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.As of March31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were invested primarily in money market accounts that invest primarily in U.S. government securities.Due to the short maturity period of the cash equivalents, the carrying amount of these instruments approximates their fair values. Our cash items that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage include deposits of $1.3 million and $26.9 million as of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015, respectively. The balance as of December 31, 2015 was comprised primarily of $25.6 million on deposit as an interest reserve to comply with the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility (defined below). As of February 2016, the Company had achieved compliance with the interest coverage ratio covenant and the restriction on the interest reserve was released. Land and Other Inventories and Homebuilding Cost of Revenues Land and other inventories include expenditures for land acquisition, land development, home construction, construction costs for homeowners association amenities, and direct and allocated indirect costs, including interest cost 4 capitalized until development and construction are substantially completed. These costs are assigned to components of land and other inventories based on specific identification, relative sales value, or area allocation methods. Land and other inventories are stated at cost unless the asset is determined to be impaired, in which case the asset is written to its fair value, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification("ASC") 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ("ASC 360"). Homebuilding cost of revenues is comprised of direct and allocated costs, including estimated future costs for the limited warranty we provide on our homes. Land acquisition, land development and other common costs are generally allocated on a relative sales value or area allocation basis to the homes or lots within the applicable community or land parcel. Land acquisition and land development costs include related interest and real estate taxes. We evaluate our land and other inventories for impairment on a quarterly basis in accordance with ASC 360 to reflect market conditions, including a market by market consideration of supply of new and resale homes for sale, level of foreclosure activity and competition. For assets held and used, if indicators are present, we perform an impairment test in which the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If such cash flows are less than the asset's carrying value, the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value. Generally, fair value is determined by discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the asset and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in the determination of fair value would vary, depending on the state of development. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of the estimated future cash flows are based on expectations of future operations and economic conditions and certain factors described below. Changes to these assumptions could significantly affect the estimates of future cash flows, which could affect the potential for future impairments. Due to the uncertainties of the estimation process, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. During the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015, our impairment assessments resulted in $0.2 million and $0.0 million of impairment charges, respectively, and are included in homebuilding cost of revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. Receivables Receivables primarily consist of amounts in transit or due from title companies for house closings and mortgage notes receivable from the sale of land. Property and Equipment, net Property and equipment, net are stated at cost and depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets: land improvements 10 to 25 years; buildings and improvements 8 to 39years; and machinery, equipment and fixtures 3 to 7 years.Maintenance and operating expenses of equipment utilized in the development of land are capitalized to land inventory.Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Property and equipment, net includes certain amenities such as club facilities on properties owned by us. These amenities include expenditures for land acquisition, land development, construction, and direct and allocated costs, including interest cost incurred during development and construction. Each reporting period, we review our property and equipment for indicators of impairment in accordance with ASC 360. For our amenities, which are located within our housing communities, indicators of potential impairment are similar to those of our housing communities (described above), as these factors may impact our ability to generate revenues at our amenities or cause construction costs to increase. In addition, we factor in the collectability and potential delinquency of the membership dues for our amenities.For the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015, we did not identify indicators of impairment for property and equipment. Assets Held for Sale We classify assets held for sale in accordance with the criteria set forth in ASC 360. We continue to opportunistically sell non-core commercial and industrial assets, as well as scattered lot positions and land assets that are 5 in excess of our needed supply in a given market. Under this plan, assets that meet the criteria above are classified as held for sale. During the three months ended March31, 2015, we changed our plans to sell assets that were previously classified as held for sale, or the assets no longer met the held-for-sale criteria, resulting in a reclassification of $4.1million of land positions to land and other inventories. There was no change in the carrying value in these assets due to this reclassification. Investments in Partnerships and LLCs When we are either deemed to hold the controlling interest in a voting interest entity or deemed to be the primary beneficiary of avariable interest entity("VIE"), we are required to consolidate the investment. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb the majority of losses of the VIE or the right to receive the majority of benefits from the VIE. Investments where we don't hold the controlling interest and we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method. Factors considered when determining if we hold the controlling interest in a voting interest entity include who holds the general partnership or managing member interests, which partner or member makes the day-to-day decisions regarding the operations of the entity, and whether or not the other partners or members have substantive participating rights. With respect to VIEs, our variable interests may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets and/or (3) loans provided by us to the investor. We examine specific criteria and use judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partner(s), sufficiency of equity to conduct the operations of the entity, voting rights, involvement in decisions significantly impacting the entity's economic performance, level of economic disproportionality between us and the other partner(s) and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs. We have investments in unconsolidated entities, including joint ventures, with independent third parties. The equity method of accounting is used for unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses of these entities. We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures ("ASC 323"). If we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Any such losses are recorded to equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. During the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015, we did not identify indicators of impairment for our investments in unconsolidated entities. Business Acquisitions When acquiring a business, we allocate the purchase price of real estate to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values.In making estimates of fair values for this purpose, we use a number of sources, including independent appraisals and information obtained about each property as a result our pre-acquisition due diligence and its marketing and housing activities. Goodwill Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net fair value amounts that were assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. There were no indicators of impairment during the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015. 6 Homebuilding Revenue Recognition In accordance with ASC 360, homebuilding revenue and related profit from the sales of housing units are recognized when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In addition, revenues from land sales are recognized in full at closing, provided the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate, any financing is considered collectible and there is no significant continuing involvement. Sales Incentives When sales incentives involve a discount on the selling price of the home, we record the discount as a reduction of revenue at the time of house closing. If the sales incentive requires us to provide a free product or service to the customer, the cost of the free product or service is recorded as homebuilding cost of revenues at the time of house closing. This includes the cost related to optional upgrades and seller-paid financing costs, closing costs, homeowners' association fees, or merchandise. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs, sales commissions and closing costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Warranty Costs Warranty reserves for houses are established to cover estimated costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims to be incurred subsequent to the closing of a house.Reserves are determined based on historical data and other relevant factors.We have, and require our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, workers compensation, and other business insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy limits. We may have recourse against subcontractors for certain claims relating to workmanship and materials.Warranty reserves are included in accrued and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. During the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015, changes in the warranty reserve consisted of the following (in thousands): Income Taxes Income taxes have been provided for using the asset and liability method under ASC 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740").The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes where deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income.In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required.Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required. ASC 740 requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a "more likely than not" standard. The realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. We established a valuation allowance against our 7 deferred tax assets in 2009 and regularly analyze all available positive and negative evidence in determining the continuing need for a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets. This evaluation considers, among other factors, historical operating results, our three-year cumulative profit or loss position, forecasts of future profitability, and the duration of statutory carryforward periods. We earned a profit before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015, and pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2016 was slightly positive. Additionally, we have seen significant increases in community count, new orders, and backlog. If homebuilding industry conditions and our business remain stable and additional positive evidence develops, we believe there could be sufficient positive evidence to support a conclusion that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize all or some portion of our deferred tax asset, which would allow us to significantly reduce the valuation allowance at some point during 2016. During the three months ended March31, 2016, we recognized a decrease of $0.6 million in the valuation allowance.As of March31, 2016, our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $123.9 million. Any interest or penalties assessed have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results.In the event we are assessed any interest or penalties in the future, we plan to include them in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as income tax expense. Share-Based Compensation On June 3, 2015, shareholders approved and we adopted the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2015 Plan"), which replaced the Amended and Restated 1997 Incentive and Capital Accumulation Plan (2011 Restatement), as amended (the "Incentive Plan"). Each of the Incentive Plan and 2015 Plan provide for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, performance awards, and stock units to officers, employees and directors of AV Homes.The exercise prices of stock options granted under the Incentive Plan or the 2015 Plan may not be less than the stock exchange closing price of our common stock on the date of grant.Stock option awards under the Incentive Plan and 2015 Plan generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. As of March31, 2016, an aggregate of 590,483 shares of our common stock, subject to certain adjustments, were reserved for issuance under the Incentive Plan, relating to outstanding options and restricted stock units previously awarded prior to the adoption of the 2015 Plan and currently outstanding under the Incentive Plan. There were approximately 442,264 shares available for grant as of March31, 2016 under the 2015 Plan and 24,698 shares reserved for issuance relating to restricted stock units previously awarded and currently outstanding under the 2015 Plan. Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to AV Homes stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of AV Homes.The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three months ended March31, 2016 did not assume the effect of employee stock options or the 6.00% Notes because the effects were antidilutive. The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three months ended March31, 2015 did not assume the effect of outstanding restricted stock, restricted stock units, employee stock options, the 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes or the 7.50% Senior Convertible Exchange Notes because the effects were antidilutive. 8 The following table represents a reconciliation of the net income (loss) and weighted average shares outstanding for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Comprehensive Income (Loss) Net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) are the same for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 will require organizations that lease assets - referred to as "lessees" - to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Under ASU 2016-02, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current GAAP. In addition, disclosures of leasing activities are to be expanded to include qualitative along with specific quantitative information. For public entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements , which clarifies the treatment of debt issuance costs from line-of-credit arrangements after adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 ("ASU 2015-15"). ASU 2015-15 clarifies that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. We have applied the provisions of ASU 2015-15 to the capitalized deferred financing costs related to our Senior Secured Credit Facility. In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ("ASU 2015-02"). ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We have applied the provisions of ASU 2015-02 and there was no material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 9 In August 2014, the FASBissued Accounting Standards UpdateNo. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of UncertaintiesAbout an entity's AbilitytoContinueas aGoingConcern ("ASU 2014-15"), which requires management to perform annual assessments on whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within oneyear of the datethefinancialstatements are issued andtoproviderelateddisclosures, if required. Theamendments inASU2014-15 are effectivefor the annual periodending after December 15,2016. Early adoption is permitted. Wedonotexpectthe adoptionofASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on our financial statements. Note 2 - Business Acquisitions Bonterra Builders Acquisition On July 1, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Bonterra Builders, LLC ("Bonterra Builders") for approximately $99.8 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. Part of the aggregate consideration includes a $6.0 million estimated earn-out. The actual amount of the earn-out may be more or less than the $6.0 million target amount based on the performance of the Bonterra Builders business through the end of 2016. A portion of the aggregate consideration equal to $0.8 million was held back by us at the closing as security for Bonterra Builder's indemnification and other potential obligations under the purchase agreement. Bonterra Builders acquires raw and developed land, develops raw land and constructs single-family homes in the Charlotte, North Carolina area. With approximately 1,700 lots owned or controlled at the time of acquisition, Bonterra Builders significantly enhances our position in a key growth market. The results of Bonterra Builders operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date of July 1, 2015. We have completed our preliminary analysis of our business combination accounting as of March31, 2016. We have not completed our final review of certain other assets and liabilities. Final determinations of the values of other assets acquired and liabilities assumed may result in adjustments to the values presented above and a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. As such, we have not completed the assignment of goodwill to reporting units at this time. Note 3 - Land and Other Inventories Land and other inventories consist of the following (in thousands): We capitalize interest to inventories during the period of development in accordance with ASC 835, Interest ("ASC 835"). Homebuilding interest capitalized to cost of inventory is included in cost of sales as related units or lots are sold. To the extent our homebuilding debt exceeds our qualified assets, as defined in ASC 835, we expense a portion of interest incurred. Qualified homebuilding assets consist of land, lots and homes that are under development or construction, excluding finished unsold homes or finished models. The following table represents interest incurred, interest capitalized, and interest expense for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 10 Note 4 - Investments in Unconsolidated Entities We participate in entities with equity interests ranging from 20% to 58% for the purpose of acquiring and/or developing land. We determine the method for accounting for our investment at inception or upon a reconsideration event. We share in the profits and losses of unconsolidated entities generally in accordance with our ownership interests. We and our equity partners typically make initial and ongoing capital contributions to these unconsolidated entities on a pro rata basis. The obligation to make capital contributions is governed by each unconsolidated entity's respective operating agreement or other governing documents. We made contributions totaling $0.0 million and $2.1million to our unconsolidated entities during the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The balance of our investments in unconsolidated entities was $1.2 million as of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015. In May 2012, we entered into an agreement with JEN Arizona 4, LLC to form a limited liability company, EM646, LLC ("EM 646").We hold a 58% interest in the venture, which was organized for the purpose of acquiring, entitling, developing, and distributing specific sections of real property located in Mesa, Arizona.The property was originally acquired in November 2012 and in April 2015 the final distribution of developed land to the partners was completed at cost. As of March31, 2016, EM 646 was financed by partner equity and does not have third-party debt. In addition, we have not provided any guarantees to the entity or our equity partner. The assets of our investee can only be used to settle obligations of the investee. Note 5 Senior Notes Our Senior Notes are summarized as follows (in thousands): We made interest payments of $12.8 million and $12.3 million for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015. 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes and 7.50% Senior Exchange Convertible Notes due 2016 On February 4, 2011, we completed an underwritten public offering for $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2016 (the "7.50% Notes"). The maturity date of the 7.50% Notes was February15,2016. The 7.50% Notes were governed by the Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture, each dated February 4, 2011, between us and the trustee named therein. Interest on the 7.50% Notes was payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year. In July 2012, we entered into exchange agreements under which we retired $44.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes, in exchange for the issuance of $44.5 million in aggregate principal of new 7.50% Senior Exchange Convertible Notes due 2016 ("7.50% Exchange Notes"). The maturity date of the 7.50% Exchange Notes was February15,2016. The 7.50% Exchange Notes are governed by the Indenture dated February 4, 2011 and the Second Supplemental Indenture dated July 25, 2012 between us and the trustee named therein. Interest on the 7.50% Exchange Notes was payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing February 15, 2013. In connection with the issuance of the 6.00% Notes (defined below), $20.5 million of 7.50% Exchange Notes and $8.7 million of 7.50% Notes were repurchased on June 23, 2015. On July 20, 2015, the remaining 7.50% Exchange 11 Notes were redeemed, pursuant to our option to redeem such notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. On February 16, 2016, the remaining 7.50% Notes were repaid at maturity. 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 On June 30, 2014, we completed an underwritten offering for $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "8.50% Notes"). The 8.50% Notes mature on July 1, 2019, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Interest on the 8.50% Notes is 8.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2015. The 8.50% Notes will be redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after July 1, 2016, at certain redemption prices, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Certain of our subsidiaries are guarantors of the 8.50% Senior Notes. All of the subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned by us, and all of the guarantees are full, unconditional, and joint and several. We have no independent assets or operations and our subsidiaries, other than the subsidiary guarantors, are minor. 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 On June23, 2015, we completed a private offering of $80.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 (the "6.00% Notes"). The proceeds of the 6.00% Notes were used to (i) repurchase 7.50% Exchange Notes and 7.50% Notes, and (ii) pay approximately $1.5 million of accrued interest (in respect of the notes being exchanged or repurchased) and premium (in respect of the notes being repurchased). The 6.00% Notes will mature on July1, 2020, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The 6.00% Notes are governed by the Indenture dated February4, 2011 and the Third Supplemental Indenture dated June 23, 2015 between us and the trustee named therein. The 6.00% Notes bear regular cash interest on the principal amount of each note, payable semi-annually in arrears on January1 and July1 of each year, beginning on January1, 2016. The 6.00% Notes were issued pursuant a series of separate, privately negotiated note purchase agreements (the "Note Purchase Agreements") entered into on June17, 2015 by us and certain qualified institutional buyers. TPG Aviator, L.P. ("TPG"), purchased $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.00% Notes for $20.0million in cash and waived its rights to purchase additional 6.00% Notes, resulting in a fully diluted beneficial ownership of approximately 43.8% of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of our Related Person Transaction Policy, the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved the terms of the 6.00% Notes and TPG's purchase of 6.00% Notes. Senior Secured Credit Facility On April 7, 2014 we entered into a $65.0 million senior secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, a lender and a letter of credit issuer, which became effective on June 6, 2014 (the "Senior Secured Credit Facility"). The other original lenders and letter of credit issuers include Royal Bank of Canada and Credit Suisse AG. Later in 2014, we increased the senior secured credit facility by $40.0 million with the addition of Citibank, N.A., and Deutsche Bank, A.G., as additional lenders. The Senior Secured Credit Facility includes revolving credit and letter of credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $105.0 million, with an "accordion" feature that allows us, with the consent of the lenders, to increase the aggregate amount to $175.0 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also includes a swing line loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $30.0million. As of March31, 2016, we had sufficient qualified assets in the borrowing base to cover the full $105.0 million capacity and had $35.0 million borrowings outstanding. Note 6 - Estimated Development Liability The estimated development liability consists primarily of utilities improvements in Rio Rico and Poinciana for more than 8,000 home sites previously sold, in most cases prior to 1980. The estimated development liability is reduced by actual expenditures and is evaluated and adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect management's estimate of potential costs.In addition, we obtainthird-party engineer evaluations on an annual basis and adjust this liability to reflect changes in the estimated costs. Cash expenditures associated with these obligations were $0.0million and $0.1million during the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Future increases or decreases of costs for 12 construction, material and labor, as well as other land development and utilities infrastructure costs, may have a significant effect on the estimated development liability. The balance of the estimated development liability was $32.5million and $32.6million as of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015, respectively. Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies Legal We are involved in litigation from time to time, primarily arising in the normal course of our business. These cases are in various procedural stages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these legal and regulatory matters, we generally cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the pending matters, the related timing, or the eventual loss. While the outcome of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Surety Bonds Surety bonds, issued by third-party entities, are used primarily to guarantee our performance to construct improvements in our various communities.As of March31, 2016, we had outstanding surety bonds of approximately $27.7 million. The amount of outstanding surety bonds could fluctuate depending on the level of development activity. We do not believe that it is likely any of these outstanding surety bonds will be drawn upon. Note 8 - Segment Information Our operating segments are defined as a component of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make operating decisions. We have identified our chief operating decision maker as our Chief Executive Officer. Our reportable segments are as follows: Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas. 13 The following table summarizes our information for reportable segments for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 (inthousands): Note 9 - Fair Value Disclosures ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820") provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, expands disclosures about fair value measurements, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The accounting standards require that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Fair value determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 14 Level 2: Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, by correlation or other means. Level 3: Fair value determined using significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flows, or similar techniques. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, and accounts payable and the Senior Secured Credit Facility approximates the fair value due to their short-term nature. Certain assets are required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying amounts and fair values of our financial liabilities as of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands): In estimating the fair value of financial liabilities, we used the following methods and assumptions: 7.50% Notes, 8.50% Senior Notes, and 6.00% Notes As of March 31, 2016 and December31, 2015, the fair value of the 7.50% Notes, the 8.50% Notes and the 6.00% Notes is estimated, based on quoted or estimated market prices.These fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Contingent consideration ("earn-out") This was first recognized as part of the purchase price paid for the Royal Oak and Bonterra Builders acquisitions in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For the fair value as of December 31, 2015, v aluation models were used to value the earn-outs by simulating earnings, applying the terms of the earn-out in each simulated path, determining the average payment in each year across all the trials of the simulation, and calculating the sum of the present values of the payments in each year. The primary inputs and key assumptions include estimated future earnings, probabilities of achievement, earnings volatility, and the discount rate. 15 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview We are engaged in the business of homebuilding and community development in Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas. We also engage to a limited degree in other real estate activities, such as the operation of amenities and the sale of land for third-party development. We manage our business through three reportable segments: Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas. For the three months ended March31, 2016, we derived 56% of our revenues from Florida, 17% of our revenues from Arizona, and 27% of our revenues from the Carolinas. Our primary business is the development of land and the construction and sale of homes for people of all ages, including active adults (55 years and older). Our current homebuilding sales activities include locations in Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas, with additional communities in the pipeline for each state. Within each geographical segment, we build both active adult communities, which are restricted to homeowners that are age 55 and older, and primary residential communities, which are open to all ages. This geographic and product segment diversification helps mitigate our overall business risks. We also opportunistically sell existing non-core commercial and industrial assets, as well as scattered lot positions and land assets, that are in excess of our needed supply in a given market. As of March 31, 2016, our current selling community count included 60 locations, 26 in Florida, nine in Arizona, and 25 in the Carolinas, with additional communities in the pipeline for each area.Our current count of communities with closings included 58 locations, 26 in Florida, eight in Arizona, and 24 in the Carolinas. Solivita and Vitalia, our active adult communities in Central Florida; CantaMia and Encore in Arizona; and Creekside at Bethpage in Raleigh, North Carolina currently serve as our flagship communities in the active adult market.These communities broaden our geographic footprint and product offering, and should provide us with market participation in the longer term growth of demand from the wave of Baby Boomers entering their retirement years. We continue to invest in the primary residential market to create a more diversified portfolio that mitigates cyclical impact over time.Through homebuilder acquisitions and by acquiring new land and lot positions, we have and continue to expand within our existing markets in Central Florida, Charlotte, Raleigh, Jacksonville and the greater Phoenix area. Replacement lot positions require new acquisitions of developed lots or platted or unplatted undeveloped land, or we may decide to develop current land holdings, depending on market conditions within the submarket of these assets. Our business is significantly influenced by a number of factors that affect our revenues, costs and capital expenditures. In managing our business and the influence of these factors, we track several key operating metrics described below. Key Operating Metrics Contracts signed . Net contracts signed for a given period represents the number of contracts we have entered into with home buyers for the purchase and sale of homes, less the number of contracts that were cancelled in the same period. We consider a home sales contract cancelled when the customer terminates the contract. Home starts . Home starts is the number of new homes on which we have started construction in a given period. Home starts are monitored by management in order to minimize the time between contract signing and closing. Closings . Closings represents the number of home sales closed in the period. We recognize revenue equal to the sales price of a home when the sales are closed and title passes to the purchasers. Backlog . Backlog is the number of homes we are building that are under contract for sale that have not closed as of the end of the period being presented. The dollar value of backlog is the revenue anticipated to be realized at closing equal to the purchase price provided in the applicable contract. Backlog is an important indicator of home closings and homebuilding revenues in future periods. 16 Average sales price . Average sales price represents total revenue for a given period divided by the number of closings for such period. Seasonality Our quarterly operating results generally fluctuate by season. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in the winter and spring months, although new order activity is also highly dependent on the number of actively selling communities and the timing of new community openings and closings as well as other market factors. We may experience higher liquidity demands during the first half of the calendar year as we incur the costs associated with new construction resulting from the increased sales volume. If, due to construction delays or other reasons, we are unable to deliver our expected number of homes in the second half of the calendar year, our full year results of operations may be adversely affected. Results of Operations The following table provides a comparison of certain financial data related to our operations for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 17 Data from closings for the Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas segments for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): First Quarter 2016 Highlights During the first quarter of 2016, we continued to execute our strategic and operational business plan through (i) the continued deployment of existing capital into land and lot acquisitions, (ii) the development of existing land and lot positions, in addition to the construction of homes for sale, (iii) the increase in the number of homes sold and closed, and (iv) the profitable sale of non-core asset positions. Three Months Ended March31, 2016 and 2015 Consolidated Results Overall revenue increased by $65.3 million or 110.9% to $124.1 million during the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the three months ended March31, 2015. This increase was comprised of homebuilding revenue, which increased by $67.9 million or 127.2% compared to the same period of 2015, partially offset by a decrease in land sales revenue of $2.6 million. The increase in homebuilding revenue was driven by a 100.9% increase in units closed and a 13.2% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. The decrease in land sales is primarily due to non-recurring sales of non-core assets in Florida in 2015. Land sales are highly variable from quarter to quarter and large fluctuations may occur. The gain on land sales during the three months ended March31, 2016 was $0.1 million compared to $2.4 million during the same period in 2015. Homebuilding Operations Homebuilding revenue, which is revenue from home closings, increased $67.9 million or 127.2% to $121.2million for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a 100.9% increase in units closed and a 13.2% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. In the Florida segment, homebuilding revenue increased $24.1 million or 57.6% for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 driven by a 48.5% increase in units closed due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from 20 to 26. In the Arizona segment, revenues increased $11.8 million or 118.8% for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 driven by a 107.7% increase in units closed due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from six to eight, including the addition of Encore at Eastmark, our new active adult community.In the Carolinas segment, revenues increased by $32.0 million for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the 2015 due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from four to 24, primarily as a result of the Bonterra Builders acquisition. Additionally, the average selling prices increased 6.0%, 5.5% and 13.7% for the Florida, Arizona and Carolinas segments, respectively. Gross margin from combined home closings increased by 190 basis points to 18.3% from 16.4% for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Gross margin from the Florida segment increased by 400 basis points to 21.4% from 17.4% for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 18 2015, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives favorably impacting our construction costs and selective price increases. Gross margin from the Arizona segment increased by 130 basis points to 14.4% from 13.1% for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to the addition of higher margin communities and selective price increases driving improvements in margins. Gross margin from the Carolinas segment increased by 440 basis points to 14.9% from 10.5% for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of Bonterra Builders. Capitalized interest included in cost of sales for the Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas segments was $1.5 million, $0.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for the three months ended March31, 2016 and was $0.9 million, $0.3 million and $0.0 million, respectively, for the same period in 2015. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 13.4% for the three months ended March31, 2016 from 18.2% for the same period in 2015 as we were able to continue to leverage the cost base over our increased revenues, primarily driven by the Bonterra Builders acquisition. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Florida segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue for the Florida segment was 13.9% for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to 15.7% for the three months ended March31, 2015. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Arizona segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue for the Arizona segment improved to 14.0% for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to 23.4% for the three months ended March31, 2015 primarily due to the cost leverage achieved from the doubling of revenue from last year. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Carolinas segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue for the Carolinas segment improved to 12.1% for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to 53.1% for the three months ended March31, 2015 due to the significant increase in revenue primarily from the acquisition of Bonterra Builders. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased by $0.4 million to $4.1 million for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, corporate general and administrative expenses improved to 3.3% for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to 6.2% for the same period in 2015. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was driven by the significant increase in revenue, while containing our costs. Interest expense decreased to $1.3 million for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to $3.3million in the same period in 2015. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to an increase in capitalized interest due to an expansion of inventory under development in 2016 as compared to 2015. Interest costs incurred, prior to capitalization, also increased to $6.9 million for the first three months of 2016 from $6.7 million in the same period of 2015 due to the amount outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility during 2016. Net income for the three months ended March31, 2016 was $0.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $5.0 million or ($0.23) per diluted share for the three months ended March31, 2015.The increase in net income for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to (i) the higher volume of closings and increases in average selling price, driving leverage in our cost base, and (ii) improved gross margins, partially offset by a decrease of $2.4 million in land sale gains. 19 Data from contracts signed for the Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas segments for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): The total number of net housing contracts signed during the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased by 197 or 40.6%. The dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $79.4million or 60.8% over the same period. The increase in units and value were driven by improvements in all segments. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Florida segment during the three months ended March31, 2016 increased by 17 or 4.7%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $10.1 million or 10.6%, due to an increase in the number of selling communities from 22 to 26. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Arizona segment during the three months ended March31, 2016 increased by 20 or 18.5%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $8.7 million or 28.5%, due to an increase in the number of selling communities from eight to nine and higher volume from existing communities that were newly opened last year. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Carolinas segment during the three months ended March31, 2016 increased by 160, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $60.6 million, due to an increase in the number of selling communities from six to 25, primarily as a result of the Bonterra Builders acquisition. The overall increase reflects an increase in the number of selling communities from 36 to 60 as well as higher average selling prices. The cancellation rate for the three months ended March31, 2016 increased to 14.8% from 13.7% three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015. The cancellation rate in the Florida segment remained steady at 14.4% for three months ended March 31, 2016. The cancellation rate in the Arizona segment increased to 24.3% for three months ended March 31, 2016 from 10.0% for three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily attributable to lot transfers within existing communities. The cancellation rate in the Carolinas segment for three months ended March 31, 2016 was 7.0% compared to 26.3% for three months ended March 31, 2015 due to the addition of Bonterra Builders communities, which focus on move-up buyers who typically have a lower cancellation rate. Backlog for the Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas segments as of March31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): 20 The backlog of housing contracts as of March31, 2016 compared to March31, 2015 increased by 450 or 74.6%, and the dollar value of backlog increased by $170.1 million or 103.2% over the same period. The increase in units of backlog was driven by increased sales due to higher community counts in all segments, as well as increases in the average price per unit sold due to price increases and the sales mix of product sold. The backlog of housing contracts in the Florida segment as of March31, 2016 compared to March31, 2015 increased by 78 or 16.7%, and the dollar value increased by $31.0 million or 24.7% over the same period, driven by the increase in selling communities from 22 to 26. The backlog of housing contracts in the Arizona segment as of March31, 2016 compared to March31, 2015 increased by 159 or 131.4%, and the dollar value increased by $55.7 million or 161.6% over the same period, driven by an increase in the number of selling communities from eight to nine, higher volume from existing communities that were newly opened last year, and a 13% increase in average selling price.The backlog of housing contracts in the Carolinas segment as of March31, 2016 compared to March31, 2015 increased by 213 and the dollar value increased by $83.4 million over the same period, driven by the increase in selling communities from six to 25, primarily as a result of the Bonterra Builders acquisition. As of March31, 2016, our inventory of unsold (speculative) homes, both completed and under construction, was 341 units, as compared to 254 units as of March31, 2015. As of March31, 2016, approximately 36% of unsold homes were completed compared to approximately 43% as of March31, 2015. The increase in speculative homes is consistent with the growth in the number of communities. The following is a breakdown of our land holdings as of March31, 2016 and December 31, 2015: (1) Estimated lots are based on historical densities for our land. New projects may ultimately be developed into more or less than the number of lots stated. In addition to the lots presented in the table above, we also have approximately 1,700 acres of commercial and industrial land, approximately 5,600 acres of unplatted scattered mixed-use land, and 690 platted scattered lots. Income Taxes Income taxes have been provided for using the asset and liability method under ASC 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740").The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes where deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income.In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required.Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. 21 We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required. ASC 740 requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a "more likely than not" standard. The realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. We established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in 2009 and regularly analyze all available positive and negative evidence in determining the continuing need for a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets. This evaluation considers, among other factors, historical operating results, our three-year cumulative profit or loss position, forecasts of future profitability, and the duration of statutory carryforward periods. We earned a profit before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015, and pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2016 was slightly positive. Additionally, we have seen significant increases in community count, new orders, and backlog. If homebuilding industry conditions and our business remain stable and additional positive evidence develops, we believe there could be sufficient positive evidence to support a conclusion that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize all or some portion of our deferred tax asset, which would allow us to significantly reduce the valuation allowance at some point during 2016. During the three months ended March31, 2016, we recognized a decrease of $0.6 million in the valuation allowance.As of March31, 2016, our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $123.9 million. Any interest or penalties assessed have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results.In the event we are assessed any interest or penalties in the future, we plan to include them in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as income tax expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary business activities are capital intensive in nature. Significant capital resources are required to finance planned active adult and primary residential communities, homebuilding construction in process, community infrastructure, selling expenses, new projects and working capital needs, including funding of debt service requirements, operating deficits and the carrying costs of land. Cash Flows As of March31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $15.6 million compared to $46.9 million as of December31, 2015.As of March31, 2016, total consolidated indebtedness was $315.0 million compared to $326.8 million as of December31, 2015. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of March31, 2016 is primarily due to the purchase and development of land and the increase in homes under construction due to higher sales and the redemption of the 7.50% Notes. Additionally, as of March31, 2016, we had $1.3 million in restricted cash as compared to $26.9 million in restricted cash as of December31, 2015 which was comprised primarily of cash on deposit as an interest reserve to comply with the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015. Our operating cash flows fluctuate relative to the status of development within existing communities, expenditures for land, new developments and other real estate activities, sales of various homebuilding product lines within those communities and other developments and to fund operating deficits. For the three months ended March31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $19.2 million. The operating cash outflow was primarily due to the increase in land and other inventories of $47.4 million and decrease in accrued liabilities of $7.6 million.Using the proceeds from our 8.50% Notes issued in June 2014 and our 6.00% Notes issued in June 2015, we purchased land and lots, including through the acquisition of the Bonterra Builders business, for the expansion of all our homebuilding segments and increased the number of homes under construction commensurate with the increase in our home sales.These outflows were partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $25.7 million related to the release of the interest reserve requirement for our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.3 million primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities was $11.8 million, primarily due to the repayment of the 7.50% Notes at maturity , partially offset by a draw of $35.0 million on the Senior Secured Credit Facility during the first quarter of 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $46.5 million. The operating cash outflow was primarily due to the net loss of $5.0 million, the increase in land and other inventories of $39.2 million, and an increase in restricted cash of $4.4 million related to a covenant requirement in our Senior Secured 22 Credit Facility. Using the proceeds from our 8.50% Notes issued in June 2014, we purchased land and lots for the expansion of all our homebuilding segments and increased the number of homes under construction commensurate with the increase in our home sales. These outflows were partially offset by cash inflow of $4.2 million from increased customer deposits. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $2.4 million primarily due to investments in a joint venture in our Arizona segment. Net cash used in financing activities was $0.1 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Performance bonds, issued by third-party entities, are used primarily to guarantee our performance to construct improvements in our various communities.As of March31, 2016, we had outstanding performance bonds of approximately $27.7 million. The amount of outstanding performance bonds could fluctuate depending on the level of development activity. We do not believe that it is likely any of these outstanding performance bonds will be drawn upon. Other Assuming that no significant adverse changes occur in our business, we anticipate the aggregate cash on hand, cash flow generated through homebuilding and related operations, and the Senior Secured Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business for the next 12 months.

("AV Homes," "we," "us," "our," or "the Company") has a controlling interest. Our investments in unconsolidated entities in which we have less than a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method.The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules andregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for complete financial statements. These statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of AV Homes as of June30, 2016 and for all periods presented. These statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in AV Homes' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2015. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Beginning with our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the selling, general and administrative expenses related to homebuilding previously included in Homebuilding expenses have been combined with corporate general and administrative expenses and reclassified into a separate new line item called "Selling, general and administrative expenses" to enhance the visibility to our core homebuilding operations and conform with standard industry presentation. The selling, general and administrative expenses reclassified include commissions, other selling expenses and overhead incurred at the divisional level. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, selling, general and administrative costs of $11.6 million and $21.4 million, respectively, were previously presented in Homebuilding expenses are now included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, in accordance with adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest , our debt issuance costs are now presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability. This guidance was applied retrospectively and had the effect of reducing our prepaid expenses and other assets and senior notes, net balances in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2015, unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $5.9 million were previously presented in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and are now included as a reduction to senior notes, net. Use of Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of June30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were primarily available funds on deposit at financial institutions.Due to the short maturity period of the cash equivalents, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximates their fair values. Our cash items that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage include deposits of $1.1 million and $26.9 million as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015, respectively. The balance as of December 31, 2015 was comprised primarily of $25.6 million on deposit as a reserve to comply with a covenant in our Senior Secured Credit Facility (defined below). As of June 30, 2016, the Company was above the specified thresholds requiring the reserve. Land and Other Inventories and Homebuilding Cost of Revenues Land and other inventories include expenditures for land acquisition, land development, home construction, construction costs for homeowners association amenities, and direct and allocated indirect costs, including interest cost capitalized until development and construction are substantially completed. These costs are assigned to components of land and other inventories based on specific identification, relative sales value, or area allocation methods. Land and other inventories are stated at cost unless the asset is determined to be impaired, in which case the asset is written to its fair value, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ("ASC 360"). 4 Homebuilding cost of revenues is comprised of direct and allocated costs, including estimated future costs for the limited warranty we provide on our homes. Land acquisition, land development and other common costs are generally allocated on a relative sales value or area allocation basis to the homes or lots within the applicable community or land parcel. Land acquisition and land development costs include related interest and real estate taxes. We evaluate our land and other inventories for impairment on a quarterly basis in accordance with ASC 360 to reflect market conditions, including a market-by-market consideration of supply of new and resale homes for sale, level of foreclosure activity and competition. For assets held and used, if indicators are present, we perform an impairment test in which the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If such cash flows are less than the asset's carrying value, the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value. Generally, fair value is determined by discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the asset and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in the determination of fair value would vary, depending on the state of development. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of the estimated future cash flows are based on expectations of future operations and economic conditions and certain factors described below. Changes to these assumptions could significantly affect the estimates of future cash flows, which could affect the potential for future impairments. Due to the uncertainties of the estimation process, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. During the three and six months ended June30, 2016, our impairment assessments resulted in less than $0.1 million and $0.2 million of impairment charges, respectively, and are included in homebuilding cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, our impairment assessments resulted in no impairment charges. Receivables Receivables primarily consist of amounts in transit or due from title companies for house closings. Property and Equipment, net Property and equipment, net are stated at cost and depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets: land improvements 10 to 25 years; buildings and improvements 8 to 39years; and machinery, equipment and fixtures 3 to 7 years.Expenses for equipment utilized in the development of land are capitalized to land inventory while ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Property and equipment, net includes certain amenities such as club facilities on properties owned by us. These amenities include expenditures for land acquisition, land development, construction, and direct and allocated costs, including interest cost incurred during development and construction. Each reporting period, we review our property and equipment for indicators of impairment in accordance with ASC 360. For our amenities, which are located within our housing communities, indicators of impairment are similar to those of our housing communities (described above), as these factors may impact our ability to generate revenues at our amenities or cause construction costs to increase. In addition, we factor in the collectability and potential delinquency of the membership dues for our amenities. For the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015, we did not identify indicators of impairment for property and equipment. Assets Held for Sale We classify assets held for sale in accordance with the criteria set forth in ASC 360. We continue to opportunistically sell non-core commercial and industrial assets, as well as scattered lot positions and land assets that are in excess of our needed supply in a given market. Investments in Partnerships and LLCs When we are either deemed to hold the controlling interest in a voting interest entity or deemed to be the primary beneficiary of avariable interest entity("VIE"), we are required to consolidate the investment. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb the majority of losses of the VIE or the right to receive the majority of benefits from the VIE. Investments where we don't hold the controlling interest and we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method. Factors considered when determining if we hold the controlling interest in a voting interest entity include who holds the general partnership or managing member interests, which partner or member makes the day-to-day decisions regarding the 5 operations of the entity, and whether or not the other partners or members have substantive participating rights. With respect to VIEs, our variable interests may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets and/or (3) loans provided by us to the investor. We examine specific criteria and use judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partner(s), sufficiency of equity to conduct the operations of the entity, voting rights, involvement in decisions significantly impacting the entity's economic performance, level of economic disproportionality between us and the other partner(s) and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs. We have investments in unconsolidated entities, including joint ventures, with independent third parties. The equity method of accounting is used for unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses of these entities. We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures ("ASC 323"). If we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Any such losses are recorded to equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. During the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015, we did not identify indicators of impairment for our investments in unconsolidated entities. Business Acquisitions When acquiring a business, we allocate the purchase price of real estate to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values. In making estimates of fair values for this purpose, we use a number of sources, including independent appraisals and information obtained about each property as a result our pre-acquisition due diligence and its marketing and housing activities. Goodwill Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net fair value amounts that were assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. There were no indicators of impairment during the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015. Homebuilding Revenue Recognition In accordance with ASC 360, homebuilding revenue and related profit from the sales of housing units are recognized when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In addition, revenues from land sales are recognized in full at closing, provided the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate, any financing is considered collectible and there is no significant continuing involvement. Sales Incentives When sales incentives involve a discount on the selling price of the home, we record the discount as a reduction of revenue at the time of house closing. If the sales incentive requires us to provide a free product or service to the customer, the cost of the free product or service is recorded as homebuilding cost of revenues at the time of house closing. This includes the cost related to optional upgrades and seller-paid financing costs, closing costs, homeowners' association fees, or merchandise. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs, sales commissions and closing costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Warranty Costs Warranty reserves for houses are established to cover estimated costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims to be incurred subsequent to the closing of a house. Reserves are determined based on historical data and other relevant factors. We have, and require our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, workers' compensation, and other business insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy limits. We may have recourse against 6 subcontractors for certain claims relating to workmanship and materials. Warranty reserves are included in accrued and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. During the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015, changes in the warranty reserve consisted of the following (in thousands): Income Taxes Our income tax benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $110.1million and $110.0million, respectively, compared to income tax expense of $0.0 million for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. The income tax benefit in the current year periods is due primarily to a $112.9 million reduction of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the current quarter. Our effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors, the most significant of which is the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets. Due to the impact of the changes in the valuation allowance, our effective tax rates in 2016 and 2015 are not correlated to the amount of our income or loss before income taxes. Income taxes have been provided for using the asset and liability method under ASC 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"). The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes where deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is "more likely than not" that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required. ASC 740 requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a "more likely than not" standard. The realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. We established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets beginning in 2009 and regularly analyzed all available positive and negative evidence in determining the continuing need for a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets. This evaluation considered, among other factors, historical operating results, our three-year cumulative profit or loss position, forecasts of future profitability, and the duration of statutory carryforward periods. From 2007 to 2014, we generated significant deferred tax assets primarily from asset impairments and reduced operational profitability. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had net deferred tax assets of $121.2 million and $124.5 million, respectively. The December 31, 2015 net deferred tax asset was offset by a valuation allowance of $124.5 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we evaluated both positive and negative evidence and determined it was "more likely than not" that our federal deferred tax assets and our state deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, we reversed $112.9 million of valuation allowance during the three months ended June 30, 2016. This reversal is reflected in our income tax benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. When a change in valuation allowance is recognized in an interim period, a portion of the valuation allowance to be reversed must be allocated to the remaining interim periods. Our income tax benefit for June 30, 2016 includes $2.7 million of this reversal. The remaining valuation allowance of $11.0 million is expected to be reversed over the third and fourth quarters of 2016. The principal positive evidence that led to the reversal of the valuation allowance during this quarter includes the following: Achievement and sustained growth of our three-year cumulative pre-tax profit. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we emerged from our three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position, producing a nominal cumulative pre-tax profit. This cumulative pre-tax profit increased to $20.1 million by the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Pre-tax income in six of the last eight quarters, including four consecutive quarters of pre-tax income through June 30, 2016. Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we reported pre-tax income 7 consistently through the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The pre-tax income in the four consecutive quarter period totaled $30.0 million. Significant pre-tax income through 2016 . The pre-tax income reported for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 of $0.9 million and $7.3 million, respectively, and the increased backlog of sold homes that are expected to close in the second half of 2016 supports the expected increased level of profitability for the full year. Continued improvements in 2016 over recent years in other key operating metrics, including revenue growth and selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A") margin, with relatively consistent gross margins. Homebuilding revenue has increased from $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $499 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenue has decreased from 30.9% to 16.0% in that same time period, while gross margins have remained between 18% and 20%. In addition, SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenue has decreased to 15.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Evidence that conditions in the U.S. economy, and specifically the U.S. housing industry, continue to be favorable and our belief that conditions will continue to be favorable over the long-term. The pace of construction remains higher than a year ago as the real estate sector increasingly reflects the stronger job market. Approved building permits for new residential construction continue to rise in 2016. Any interest or penalties assessed have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results. In the event we are assessed any interest or penalties in the future, we plan to include them in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as income tax expense. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we made income tax payments of $0.6 million and $0.0 million, respectively. Share-Based Compensation On June 3, 2015, shareholders approved and we adopted the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2015 Plan"), which replaced the Amended and Restated 1997 Incentive and Capital Accumulation Plan (2011 Restatement), as amended (the "Incentive Plan"). Each of the Incentive Plan and 2015 Plan provide for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, performance awards, and stock units to officers, employees and directors of AV Homes. The exercise prices of stock options granted under the Incentive Plan or the 2015 Plan may not be less than the stock exchange closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock option awards under the Incentive Plan and 2015 Plan generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. As of June30, 2016, an aggregate of 590,483 shares of our common stock, subject to certain adjustments, were reserved for issuance under the Incentive Plan, relating to outstanding options and restricted stock units previously awarded prior to the adoption of the 2015 Plan and currently outstanding under the Incentive Plan. Additionally, there were an aggregate of 418,068 shares available for grant as of June30, 2016 under the 2015 Plan and 49,760 shares reserved for issuance relating to restricted stock units previously awarded and currently outstanding under the 2015 Plan. Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of AV Homes. The computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 did not assume the effect of employee stock options because the effects were antidilutive. The computation of diluted loss per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 did not assume the effect of restricted stock, restricted stock units, employee stock options, or convertible notes because the effects were antidilutive. 8 The following table represents a reconciliation of the net income (loss) and weighted average shares outstanding for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Comprehensive Income (Loss) Net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) are the same for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015 because we do not have components of comprehensive income. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 will require organizations that lease assets - referred to as "lessees" - to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Under ASU 2016-02, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current GAAP. In addition, disclosures of leasing activities are to be expanded to include qualitative along with specific quantitative information. For public entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements , which clarifies the treatment of debt issuance costs from line-of-credit arrangements after adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 ("ASU 2015-15"). ASU 2015-15 clarifies that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. We have applied the provisions of ASU 2015-15 to the capitalized deferred financing costs related to our Senior Secured Credit Facility. In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ("ASU 2015-02"). ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We have applied the provisions of ASU 2015-02 and there was no material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2014, the FASBissued Accounting Standards UpdateNo. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of UncertaintiesAbout an entity's AbilitytoContinueas aGoingConcern ("ASU 2014-15"), which requires management to perform annual assessments on whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within oneyear of the datethefinancialstatements are issued andtoproviderelateddisclosures, if required. Theamendments inASU2014-15 are effectivefor the annual periodending after December 15,2016. Early adoption is permitted. Wedonotexpectthe adoptionofASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 9 In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , which delayed the effective date by one year. As a result, the standard is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018 and allows for full retrospective or modified retrospective methods of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. Note 2 - Business Acquisitions Bonterra Builders Acquisition On July 1, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Bonterra Builders, LLC ("Bonterra Builders") for approximately $99.8 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. Part of the aggregate consideration includes a $6.0 million estimated earn-out. The actual amount of the earn-out may be more or less than the $6.0 million target amount based on the performance of the Bonterra Builders business through the end of 2016, of which $3.3 million has been paid as of June 30, 2016. A portion of the aggregate consideration equal to $0.8 million was held back by us at the closing as security for Bonterra Builder's indemnification and other potential obligations under the purchase agreement. Bonterra Builders acquires raw and developed land, develops raw land and constructs single-family homes in the Charlotte, North Carolina area. With approximately 1,700 lots owned or controlled at the time of acquisition, Bonterra Builders significantly enhances our position in a key growth market. The results of Bonterra Builders operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date of July 1, 2015. The Bonterra Builders acquisition was accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"). We recorded the acquired assets and liabilities at their estimated fair value. We determined the estimated fair values with the assistance of appraisals or valuations performed by independent third-party specialists, discounted cash flow analyses, quoted market prices where available, and estimates by management. To the extent the consideration transferred exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired in this transaction, such excess was assigned to goodwill. Note 3 - Land and Other Inventories Land and other inventories consist of the following (in thousands): We capitalize interest to inventories during the period of development in accordance with ASC 835, Interest ("ASC 835"). Homebuilding interest capitalized to cost of inventory is included in cost of sales as related units or lots are sold. To the extent our homebuilding debt exceeds our qualified assets, as defined in ASC 835, we expense a portion of interest incurred. Qualified homebuilding assets consist of land, lots and homes that are under development or construction, excluding finished unsold homes or finished models. The following table represents interest incurred, interest capitalized, and interest expense for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 10 Note 4 - Investments in Unconsolidated Entities We participate in entities with equity interests ranging from 20% to 58% for the purpose of acquiring and/or developing land. We determine the method for accounting for our investment at inception or upon a reconsideration event. We share in the profits and losses of unconsolidated entities generally in accordance with our ownership interests. We and our equity partners typically make initial and ongoing capital contributions to these unconsolidated entities on a pro rata basis. The obligation to make capital contributions is governed by each unconsolidated entity's respective operating agreement or other governing documents. We made contributions totaling less than $0.1 million to our unconsolidated entities during the three and six months ended June30, 2016. We made contributions totaling $0.8 million and $2.9million to our unconsolidated entities during the three and six months ended June30, 2015, respectively. The balance of our investments in unconsolidated entities was $1.2 million as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015. In May 2012, we entered into an agreement with JEN Arizona 4, LLC to form a limited liability company, EM646, LLC ("EM 646"). We hold a 58% interest in the venture, which was organized for the purpose of acquiring, entitling, developing, and distributing specific sections of real property located in Mesa, Arizona. The property was originally acquired in November 2012 and in April 2015 the final distribution of developed land to the partners was completed at cost. As of June30, 2016, EM 646 was financed by partner equity and does not have third-party debt. In addition, we have not provided any guarantees to the entity or our equity partner. The assets of our investee can only be used to settle obligations of the investee. Note 5 Senior Notes Our Senior Notes are summarized as follows (in thousands): We made interest payments of $0.0 million and $12.8 million for the three and six months ended June30, 2016, respectively. We made interest payments of $9.7 million and $22.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015. 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes and 7.50% Senior Exchange Convertible Notes due 2016 On February 4, 2011, we completed an underwritten public offering for $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2016 (the "7.50% Notes"). The maturity date of the 7.50% Notes was February15,2016. The 7.50% Notes were governed by the Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture, each dated February 4, 2011, between us and the trustee named therein. Interest on the 7.50% Notes was payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year. In July 2012, we entered into exchange agreements under which we retired $44.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes, in exchange for the issuance of $44.5 million in aggregate principal of new 7.50% Senior Exchange Convertible Notes due 2016 ("7.50% Exchange Notes"). The maturity date of the 7.50% Exchange Notes was February15,2016. The 7.50% Exchange Notes are governed by the Indenture dated February 4, 2011 and the Second Supplemental Indenture dated July 25, 2012 between us and the trustee named therein. Interest on the 7.50% Exchange Notes was payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing February 15, 2013. In connection with the issuance of the 6.00% Notes (defined below), $20.5 million of 7.50% Exchange Notes and $8.7 million of 7.50% Notes were repurchased on June 23, 2015. On July 20, 2015, the remaining 7.50% Exchange Notes were redeemed, pursuant to our option to redeem such notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. On February 16, 2016, the remaining 7.50% Notes were repaid at maturity. 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 On June 30, 2014, we completed an underwritten offering for $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "8.50% Notes"). The 8.50% Notes mature on July 1, 2019, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Interest on the 8.50% Notes is 8.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on January 1 and July 1 of 11 each year, commencing January 1, 2015. The 8.50% Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after July 1, 2016, at certain redemption prices, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Certain of our subsidiaries are guarantors of the 8.50% Senior Notes. All of the subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned by us, and all of the guarantees are full, unconditional, and joint and several. We have no independent assets or operations and our subsidiaries, other than the subsidiary guarantors, are minor. 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 On June23, 2015, we completed a private offering of $80.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 (the "6.00% Notes"). The proceeds of the 6.00% Notes were used to (i) repurchase 7.50% Exchange Notes and 7.50% Notes, and (ii) pay approximately $1.5 million of accrued interest (in respect of the notes being exchanged or repurchased) and premium (in respect of the notes being repurchased). The 6.00% Notes will mature on July1, 2020, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The 6.00% Notes are governed by the Indenture dated February4, 2011 and the Third Supplemental Indenture dated June 23, 2015 between us and the trustee named therein. The 6.00% Notes bear regular cash interest on the principal amount of each note, payable semi-annually in arrears on January1 and July1 of each year, beginning on January1, 2016. The 6.00% Notes were issued pursuant a series of separate, privately negotiated note purchase agreements (the "Note Purchase Agreements") entered into on June17, 2015 by us and certain qualified institutional buyers. TPG Aviator, L.P. ("TPG"), purchased $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.00% Notes for $20.0million in cash and waived its rights to purchase additional 6.00% Notes, resulting in a fully diluted beneficial ownership of approximately 43.8% of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of our Related Person Transaction Policy, the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved the terms of the 6.00% Notes and TPG's purchase of 6.00% Notes. Senior Secured Credit Facility On April 7, 2014 we entered into a $65.0 million senior secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, a lender and a letter of credit issuer, which became effective on June 6, 2014 (the "Senior Secured Credit Facility"). The other original lenders and letter of credit issuers include Royal Bank of Canada and Credit Suisse AG. Later in 2014, we increased the Senior Secured Credit Facility by $40.0 million with the addition of Citibank, N.A., and Deutsche Bank, A.G., as additional lenders. The Senior Secured Credit Facility includes revolving credit and letter of credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $105.0 million, with an "accordion" feature that allows us, with the consent of the lenders, to increase the aggregate amount to $175.0 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also includes a swing line loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $30.0million. As of June30, 2016, we had sufficient qualified assets in the borrowing base to cover the full $105.0 million capacity and had $35.0 million borrowings outstanding. On July 28, 2016, we upsized and extended our Senior Secured Credit Facility through July 28, 2019. See Note 10, Subsequent Events . Note 6 - Estimated Development Liability The estimated development liability consists primarily of utilities improvements in Rio Rico, Arizona and Poinciana, Florida for more than 8,000 home sites previously sold, in most cases prior to 1980. The estimated development liability is reduced by actual expenditures and is evaluated and adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect management's estimate of potential costs. In addition, we obtainthird-party engineer evaluations on an annual basis and adjust this liability to reflect changes in the estimated costs. Cash expenditures associated with these obligations were $0.1million during each of the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015. Future increases or decreases of costs for construction, material and labor, as well as other land development and utilities infrastructure costs, may have a significant effect on the estimated development liability. The balance of the estimated development liability was $32.4million and $32.6million as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015, respectively. Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies Legal We are involved in litigation from time to time, primarily arising in the normal course of our business. These cases are in various procedural stages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these legal and regulatory matters, we generally cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the pending matters, the related timing, or the eventual loss. While the 12 outcome of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Surety Bonds Surety bonds, issued by third-party entities, are used primarily to guarantee our performance to construct improvements in our various communities. As of June30, 2016, we had outstanding surety bonds of approximately $32.0 million. The amount of outstanding surety bonds could fluctuate depending on the level of development activity. We do not believe that it is likely any of these outstanding surety bonds will be drawn upon. Note 8 - Segment Information Our operating segments are defined as a component of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make operating decisions. We have identified our chief operating decision maker as our Chief Executive Officer. Our reportable segments are as follows: Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas. The following table summarizes our information for reportable segments for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015 (inthousands): 13 Note 9 - Fair Value Disclosures ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820") provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, expands disclosures about fair value measurements, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The accounting standards require that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Fair value determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2: Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, by correlation or other means. Level 3: Fair value determined using significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flows, or similar techniques. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, and accounts payable and the Senior Secured Credit Facility approximates the fair value due to their short-term nature. Certain assets are required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying amounts and fair values of our financial liabilities as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands): (1) The carrying value of the debt instruments are net of unamortized deferred financing costs and certain debt discounts. (2) In the three month period ended June 30, 2016, we paid $4.3 million of the earn-out. In estimating the fair value of financial liabilities, we used the following methods and assumptions: 7.50% Notes, 8.50% Notes, and 6.00% Notes As of June 30, 2016 and December31, 2015, the fair value of the 7.50% Notes, the 8.50% Notes and the 6.00% Notes is estimated, based on quoted or estimated market prices. These fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Contingent consideration ("earn-out") This was first recognized as part of the purchase price paid for the Royal Oak and Bonterra Builders acquisitions in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For the fair value as of December 31, 2015, v aluation models were used to value the earn-outs by simulating earnings, applying the terms of the earn-out in each simulated path, determining the average payment in each year across all the trials of the simulation, and calculating the sum of the present values of the payments in each year. The primary inputs and key assumptions include estimated future earnings, probabilities of achievement, earnings volatility, and the discount rate. 14 Note 10 Subsequent Event On July 28, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facility and existing Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (the "Amendment"). Pursuant to the Amendment, from the period beginning on July 28, 2016 and ending on June 5, 2017, the Amendment increases the committed amount available under the Credit Agreement to $165.0 million. On June 6, 2017 the total committed amount available under the Credit Agreement will be reduced to $150.0 million (the "Extended Commitments"). The Extended Commitments will expire on July 28, 2019 and any loans outstanding on such date will mature and be payable. The Senior Secured Credit Facility includes an "accordion" feature that allows the Company, with the consent of the lenders, which was increased from $175.0 million to $200.0 million in connection with the Amendment. 15 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview We are engaged in the business of homebuilding and community development in Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas. We also engage to a limited degree in other real estate activities, such as the operation of amenities and the sale of land for third-party development. We manage our business through three reportable segments: Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas. For six months ended June30, 2016, we derived 52% of our revenues from Florida, 20% of our revenues from Arizona, and 28% of our revenues from the Carolinas. Our primary business is the development of land and the construction and sale of homes for people of all ages, including active adults (55 years and older). Our current homebuilding sales activities include locations in Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas, with additional communities in the pipeline for each state. Within each geographical segment, we build both active adult communities, which are restricted to homeowners that are age 55 and older, and primary residential communities, which are open to all ages. This geographic and product segment diversification helps mitigate our overall business risks. We also opportunistically sell existing non-core commercial and industrial assets, as well as scattered lot positions and land assets, that are in excess of our needed supply in a given market. As of June30, 2016, our current selling community count included 62 locations, 27 in Florida, nine in Arizona, and 26 in the Carolinas, with additional communities in the pipeline for each area. Our count of communities with closings as of June 30, 2016 included 59 locations, 26 in Florida, nine in Arizona, and 24 in the Carolinas. Solivita and Vitalia, our active adult communities in Central Florida; CantaMia and Encore in Arizona; and Creekside at Bethpage in Raleigh, North Carolina currently serve as our flagship communities in the active adult market. These communities broaden our geographic footprint and product offering, and should provide us with market participation in the longer term growth of demand from the wave of Baby Boomers entering their retirement years. We continue to invest in the primary residential market to create a more diversified portfolio that mitigates cyclical impact over time. Through homebuilder acquisitions and by acquiring new land and lot positions, we have expanded and continue to expand within our existing markets in Central Florida, Charlotte, Raleigh, Jacksonville and the greater Phoenix area. Replacement lot positions require new acquisitions of developed lots or platted or unplatted undeveloped land, or we may decide to develop current land holdings, depending on market conditions within the submarket of these assets. Our business is significantly influenced by a number of factors that affect our revenues, costs and capital expenditures. In managing our business and the influence of these factors, we track several key operating metrics described below. Key Operating Metrics Contracts signed . Net contracts signed for a given period represents the number of contracts we have entered into with home buyers for the purchase and sale of homes, less the number of contracts that were cancelled in the same period. We consider a home sales contract cancelled when the customer terminates the contract. Home starts . Home starts is the number of new homes on which we have started construction in a given period. Home starts are monitored by management in order to minimize the time between contract signing and home closing. Closings . Closings represents the number of home sales closed in the period. We recognize revenue equal to the sales price of a home when the sales are closed and title passes to the purchasers. Backlog . Backlog is the number of homes we are building that are under contract for sale that have not closed as of the end of the period being presented. The dollar value of backlog is the revenue anticipated to be realized at closing equal to the purchase price provided in the applicable contract. Backlog is an important indicator of home closings and homebuilding revenues in future periods. Average sales price . Average sales price represents total revenue for a given period divided by the number of closings for such period. 16 Seasonality Our quarterly operating results generally fluctuate by season. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in the winter and spring months, although new order activity is also highly dependent on the number of actively selling communities and the timing of new community openings and closings as well as other market factors. We may experience higher liquidity demands during the first half of the calendar year as we incur the costs associated with new construction resulting from the increased sales volume. If, due to construction delays or other reasons, we are unable to deliver our expected number of homes in the second half of the calendar year, our full year results of operations may be adversely affected. Results of Operations The following table provides a comparison of certain financial data related to our operations for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 17 Data from closings for the Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas segments for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Second Quarter 2016 Highlights During the second quarter of 2016, we continued to execute our strategic and operational business plan through (i) the continued deployment of existing capital into land and lot acquisitions, (ii) the development of existing land and lot positions, in addition to the construction of homes for sale, (iii) the increase in the number of homes sold and closed, and (iv) the profitable sale of non-core asset positions. Three Months Ended June30, 2016 and 2015 Consolidated Results Overall revenue increased by $108.7 million or 136.9% to $188.1 million during the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June30, 2015. This increase was comprised of homebuilding revenue, which increased by $108.7 million or 143.2% compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in homebuilding revenue was driven by a 104.1% increase in units closed and 19.2% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. Amenity and other revenue and land sales remained relatively comparable to the prior period. The gain on land sales during the three months ended June30, 2016 was $0.4 million compared to $0.7 million during the same period in 2015. Homebuilding Operations Homebuilding revenue, which is revenue from home closings, increased $108.7 million or 143.2% to $184.6million for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a 104.1%increase in units closed and a 19.2% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. In the Florida segment, homebuilding revenue increased $31.9 18 million or 56.3% for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily driven by a 43.6% increase in units closed due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from 21 to 26. In the Arizona segment, revenues increased $25.3 million or 165.5% for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily driven by a 116.7% increase in units closed due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from six to nine, including the addition of Encore at Eastmark, our new active adult community. In the Carolinas segment, revenues increased by $51.5 million for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from five to 24, primarily as a result of the Bonterra Builders acquisition. Additionally, the average selling prices increased 8.9%, 22.6% and 21.2% for the Florida, Arizona and Carolinas segments, respectively, due to a combination of selective price increases and the mix of communities with closings, as many of the newly opened communities had average selling prices that were higher than the overall average for the segment. Gross margin from combined home closings increased by 130 basis points to 18.0% from 16.7% for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Gross margin from the Florida segment increased by 300 basis points to 21.8% from 18.8% for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives favorably impacting our construction costs and selective price increases. Gross margin from the Arizona segment increased by 550 basis points to 16.5% from 11.0% for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to the addition of higher margin communities and selective price increases driving improvements in margins. Gross margin from the Carolinas segment increased by 480 basis points to 13.0% from 8.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of Bonterra Builders. The Carolinas gross margin for the three months ended June 30, 2016 also includes $0.9 million of expense associated with the purchase accounting write-up of the Bonterra Builders in-process inventory that did not affect the margins in the same period in 2015. Capitalized interest included in cost of sales for the Florida, Arizona and Carolinas segments was $2.2 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for the three months ended June30, 2016 and was $1.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, for the same period in 2015. Total selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 14.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from 21.0% for the same period in 2015. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 11.7% for the three months ended June30, 2016 from 15.3% for the same period in 2015 as we were able to continue to leverage the cost base over our increased revenues, primarily driven by the Bonterra Builders acquisition. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Florida segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue for the Florida segment was 13.5% for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to 14.4% for the three months ended June30, 2015. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Arizona segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 9.6% for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to 16.5% for the three months ended June30, 2015 primarily due to the cost leverage achieved from the more than doubling of revenue from last year. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Carolinas segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue for the Carolinas segment improved to 10.3% for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to 24.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2015 due to the significant increase in revenue primarily from the acquisition of Bonterra Builders. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million to $4.2 million for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. As a percentage of homebuilding revenue, corporate general and administrative expenses improved to 2.3% for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to 5.6% for the same period in 2015. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was driven by the significant increase in revenue, while containing our costs. Interest expense decreased by $1.5 million to $0.9 million for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to an increase in capitalized interest due to an expansion of inventory under development in 2016 as compared to 2015. Income tax benefit for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $110.1 million from $0.0 million for the same period in 2015 due to the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the current period. Net income for the three months ended June30, 2016 was $117.4 million or $4.45 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $4.5 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the three months ended June30, 2015. The increase in net income for the three months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to (i) the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance (ii) the higher volume of closings and increases in average selling price, driving leverage in our cost base, and (iii) improved gross margins. 19 Six Months Ended June30, 2016 and 2015 Consolidated Results Overall revenue increased by $174.0 million or 125.9% to $312.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. This increase was comprised of homebuilding revenue, which increased by $176.6 million or 136.6% compared to the same period of 2015, partially offset by a decrease in land sales revenue of $2.6 million. The increase in homebuilding revenue was driven by a 102.8% increase in units closed and a 16.7% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. The decrease in land sales is primarily due to non-recurring sales of non-core assets in Florida in 2015. Land sales can be highly variable from quarter to quarter and large fluctuations may occur. The gain on land sales during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.4 million compared to $3.1 million during the same period in 2015. Homebuilding Operations Homebuilding revenue, which is revenue from home closings, increased $176.6 million or 136.6% to $305.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a 102.8% increase in units closed and a 16.7% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. In the Florida segment, homebuilding revenue increased $56.1 million or 56.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 driven by a 45.7% increase in units closed due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from 21 to 26. In the Arizona segment, revenues increased $37.1 million or 147.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 driven by a 113.1% increase in units closed due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from six to nine, including the addition of Encore at Eastmark, our new active adult community. In the Carolinas segment, revenues increased by $83.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from five to 24, primarily as a result of the Bonterra Builders acquisition. Additionally, the average selling prices increased 7.6%, 16.0% and 18.4% for the Florida, Arizona and Carolinas segments, respectively, due to a combination of selective price increases and the mix of communities with closings in each respective period. Gross margin from combined home closings increased by 150 basis points to 18.1% from 16.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Gross margin from the Florida segment increased by 340 basis points to 21.6% from 18.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives favorably impacting our construction costs and selective price increases. Gross margin from the Arizona segment increased by 400 basis points to 15.8% from 11.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to the addition of higher margin communities and selective price increases driving improvements in margins. Gross margin from the Carolinas segment increased by 490 basis points to 13.7% from 8.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of Bonterra Builders. The Carolinas gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2016 also includes $1.4 million of expense associated with the purchase accounting write-up of the Bonterra Builders in-process inventory that did not affect the margins in the same period in 2015. Capitalized interest included in cost of sales for the Florida, Arizona and Carolinas segments was $3.8 million, $2.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and was $2.2 million, $0.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively, for the same period in 2015. Total selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 15.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from 22.7% for the same period in 2015. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 12.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from 16.5% for the same period in 2015 as we were able to continue to leverage the cost base over our increased revenues, primarily driven by the Bonterra Builders acquisition. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Florida segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue for the Florida segment was 13.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 15.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Arizona segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue for the Arizona segment improved to 11.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 19.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to the cost leverage achieved from the more than doubling of revenue from the same period in 2015. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Carolinas segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue for the Carolinas segment improved to 11.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 32.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2015 due to the significant increase in revenue primarily from the acquisition of Bonterra Builders. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased by $0.3 million to $8.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. As a percentage of homebuilding revenue, corporate general and administrative 20 expenses improved to 2.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 6.1% for the same period in 2015. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was driven by the significant increase in revenue, while containing our costs. Interest expense decreased by $3.5 million to $2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $5.7 million in the same period in 2015. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to an increase in capitalized interest due to an expansion of inventory under development in 2016 as compared to 2015. Income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $110.0 million from $0.0 million for the same period in 2015 due to the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in June 2016. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $118.2 million or $4.53 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to (i) the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance (ii) the higher volume of closings and increases in average selling price, driving leverage in our cost base, and (iii) improved gross margins, partially offset by a decrease of $2.6 million in land sale gains. Data from contracts signed for the Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas segments for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 The total number of net housing contracts signed during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased by 194 or 39.5%. The dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $75.8 million or 55.1% over the same period. The increase in units and value were driven by improvements in all segments. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Florida segment during the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased by 33 or 10.1%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $11.5 million or 13.0%, due to an increase in the number of selling communities 21 from 23 to 27. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Arizona segment during the three months ended June 30, 2016 was relatively comparable to the prior year period, increasing by 2 or 1.5%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $3.7 million or 9.7%, due to selective price increases and increases in sales in higher priced communities, while having the same number of selling communities as the prior period. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Carolinas segment during the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased by 159, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $60.6 million, due to an increase in the number of selling communities from six to 26, primarily as a result of the Bonterra Builders acquisition. The overall increase reflects an increase in the number of selling communities from 38 to 62 as well as higher average selling prices. The cancellation rate during the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to 15.6% from 16.8% compared to the same period in 2015. The cancellation rate in the Florida segment increased slightly to 16.1% from 15.3% over the same period. The cancellation rate in the Arizona segment during the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased slightly to 22.2% from 21.6% compared to the same period in 2015. The cancellation rate in the Carolinas segment during three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to 9.4% from 10.5% during the three months ended June 30, 2015 due to the addition of Bonterra Builders communities, which typically focus on move-up buyers who tend to have a lower cancellation rate. Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 The total number of net housing contracts signed during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased by 391 or 40.1%. The dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $155.2 million or 57.9% over the same period. The increase in units and value were driven by improvements in all segments. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Florida segment during the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased by 50 or 7.3%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $21.6 million or 11.8%, due to an increase in the number of selling communities from 23 to 27. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Arizona segment during the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased by 22 or 9.2%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $12.5 million or 18.0%, due to higher volume from existing communities that were newly opened last year. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Carolinas segment during the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased by 319, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $121.1 million, due to an increase in the number of selling communities from six to 26, primarily as a result of the Bonterra Builders acquisition. The overall increase reflects an increase in the number of selling communities from 38 to 62 as well as higher average selling prices. The cancellation rate during the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased slightly to 15.2% from 15.3% compared to the same period in 2015. The cancellation rate in the Florida segment increased slightly to 15.3% from 14.7% over the same period. The cancellation rate in the Arizona segment during the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to 23.2% from 16.7% compared to the same period in 2015, primarily attributable to lot transfers within existing communities in the first quarter of 2016. The cancellation rate in the Carolinas segment during the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to 8.3% compared to 15.8% during six months ended June 30, 2015 due to the addition of Bonterra Builders communities, which typically focus on move-up buyers who tend to have a lower cancellation rate. Backlog for the Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas segments as of June30, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): The backlog of housing contracts as of June 30, 2016 compared to June 30, 2015 increased by 341 or 42.5%, and the dollar value of backlog increased by $136.8 million or 60.4% over the same period. The increase in units of backlog was driven 22 by increased sales due to higher community counts in all segments, as well as increases in the average price per unit sold due to price increases and the sales mix of product sold. The backlog of housing contracts in the Florida segment as of June 30, 2016 compared to June 30, 2015 increased by 16 or 2.8%, and the dollar value increased by $10.6 million or 6.8% over the same period, driven by the increase in selling communities from 23 to 27. The backlog of housing contracts in the Arizona segment as of June 30, 2016 compared to June 30, 2015 increased by 91 or 47.4%, and the dollar value increased by $34.3 million or 59.5% over the same period, driven by higher volume from existing communities that were newly opened last year, and an 8.2% increase in average selling price. The backlog of housing contracts in the Carolinas segment as of June 30, 2016 compared to June 30, 2015 increased by 234 and the dollar value increased by $91.9 million over the same period, driven by the increase in selling communities from six to 26, primarily as a result of the Bonterra Builders acquisition. As of June 30, 2016, our inventory of unsold (speculative) homes, both completed and under construction, was 439 units, as compared to 314 units as of June 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, approximately 23% of unsold homes were completed compared to approximately 32% as of June 30, 2015. The increase in speculative homes is consistent with the growth in the number of communities. The following is a breakdown of our land holdings as of June30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: (1) Estimated lots are based on historical densities for our land. New projects may ultimately be developed into more or less than the number of lots stated. In addition to the lots presented in the table above, we also have approximately 1,700 acres of commercial and industrial land, approximately 5,600 acres of unplatted scattered mixed-use land, and 690 platted scattered lots. Income Taxes Income taxes have been provided for using the asset and liability method under ASC 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"). The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes where deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is "more likely than not" that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required. ASC 740 requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a "more likely than not" standard. The realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. We established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in 2009 and regularly analyzed all available positive and negative evidence in determining the continuing need for a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets. This evaluation considered, among other factors, historical operating results, our three-year cumulative profit or loss position, forecasts of future profitability, and the duration of statutory carryforward periods. After careful evaluation 23 of all positive and negative evidence, and giving more weight to objectively verifiable evidence over more subjective evidence, we concluded as of June 30, 2016 that it was "more likely than not" that all of our federal deferred tax assets and our state deferred tax assets will be realized. Even if industry conditions weaken from current levels, we believe we will be able to adjust our operations to sustain long-term profitability. Accordingly, we reversed $112.9 million of valuation allowance during the three months ended June 30, 2016. When a change in valuation allowance is recognized in an interim period, a portion of the valuation allowance to be reversed must be allocated to the remaining interim periods. Our income tax benefit for June 30, 2016 includes $2.7 million of this reversal. The remaining valuation allowance of $11.0 million is anticipated to be reversed over the third and fourth quarters of 2016. Any interest or penalties assessed have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results. In the event we are assessed any interest or penalties in the future, we plan to include them in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as income tax expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary business activities are capital intensive in nature. Significant capital resources are required to finance planned active adult and primary residential communities, homebuilding construction in process, community infrastructure, selling expenses, new projects and working capital needs, including funding of debt service requirements, operating deficits and the carrying costs of land. We finance these capital needs through our cash on hand, operating cash flows, senior credit facility, senior notes and capital markets. For more information regarding our debt, see Note 5, Senior Notes , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Cash Flows As of June30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $23.1 million compared to $46.9 million as of December31, 2015. As of June30, 2016, total consolidated indebtedness was $315.0 million compared to $326.8 million as of December31, 2015. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of June30, 2016 is primarily due to the purchase and development of land and the increase in homes under construction due to higher sales and the redemption of the 7.50% Notes. Additionally, as of June30, 2016, we had $1.1 million in restricted cash as compared to $26.9 million in restricted cash as of December31, 2015, which was comprised primarily of cash on deposit as an interest reserve to comply with the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2016, the Company was above the specified thresholds requiring the reserve. Our operating cash flows fluctuate relative to the status of development within existing communities, expenditures for land, new developments and other real estate activities, sales of various homebuilding product lines within those communities and other developments and to fund operating deficits. For the six months ended June30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $7.5 million. The operating cash outflow was primarily due to the net income of $118.2 million offset by the $110.2 million decrease in deferred tax assets, net due to the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in June 2016. The remaining change was due to the increase in land and other inventories of $54.0 million partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $25.9 million related to the release of the interest reserve requirement for our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.3 million primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities was $16.1 million, primarily due to the repayment of the remaining $46.8 million of 7.50% Notes at maturity , partially offset by a draw of $35.0 million on the Senior Secured Credit Facility during the first quarter of 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $98.0 million. The operating cash outflow was primarily due to the net loss of $9.5 million, the increase in land and other inventories of $89.8 million, and an increase in restricted cash of $8.7 million related to a covenant requirement in our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Using the proceeds from our 8.50% Senior Notes issued in June 2014, we purchased land and lots for the expansion of all our homebuilding segments and increased the number of homes under construction commensurate with the increase in our home sales. These outflows were partially offset by cash inflow of $5.9 million from increased customer deposits. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $3.8 million primarily due to investments in a joint venture in our Arizona segment. Net cash provided by financing activities was $34.7 million, primarily due to the issuance of $80.0 million of 6.00% Notes, partially offset by the repurchase of $44.6 million of 7.50% Notes and 7.50% Exchange Notes. 24 Other Assuming that no significant adverse changes occur in our business, we anticipate the aggregate cash on hand, cash flow generated through homebuilding and related operations, and the Senior Secured Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business for the next 12 months. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Performance bonds, issued by third-party entities, are used primarily to guarantee our performance to construct improvements in our various communities. As of June30, 2016, we had outstanding performance bonds of approximately $32.0 million. The amount of outstanding performance bonds could fluctuate depending on the level of development activity. We do not believe that it is likely any of these outstanding performance bonds will be drawn upon.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AV HOMES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands) See notes to consolidated financial statements. 1 AV HOMES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) (in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) See notes to consolidated financial statements. 2 AV HOMES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands) (unaudited) See notes to consolidated financial statements. 3 AV HOMES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) September30, 2016 Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AV Homes, Inc. and all subsidiaries, partnerships and other entities in which AV Homes, Inc. ("AV Homes," "we," "us," "our," or "the Company") has a controlling interest. Our investments in unconsolidated entities in which we have less than a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method.The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules andregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for complete financial statements. These statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of AV Homes as of September30, 2016 and for all periods presented. These statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in AV Homes' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2015. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Beginning with our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the selling, general and administrative expenses related to homebuilding previously included in Homebuilding expenses have been combined with corporate general and administrative expenses and reclassified into a separate new line item called "Selling, general and administrative expenses" to enhance the visibility to our core homebuilding operations and conform with standard industry presentation. The selling, general and administrative expenses reclassified include commissions, other selling expenses and overhead incurred at the divisional level. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, selling, general and administrative costs of $19.4 million and $40.7 million, respectively, that were previously presented in Homebuilding expenses are now included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, in accordance with adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest , our debt issuance costs are now presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability. This guidance was applied retrospectively and had the effect of reducing our prepaid expenses and other assets and senior notes, net balances in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2015, unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $5.9 million were previously presented in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and are now included as a reduction to senior notes, net. Use of Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of September30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were primarily available funds on deposit at financial institutions.Due to the short maturity period of the cash equivalents, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximates their fair values. Our cash items that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage include deposits of $1.1 million and $26.9 million as of September30, 2016 and December31, 2015, respectively. The balance as of December 31, 2015 was comprised primarily of $25.6 million on deposit as a reserve to comply with a covenant in our Senior Secured Credit Facility (defined below). As of September30, 2016, the Company was above the specified thresholds requiring the reserve. Land and Other Inventories and Homebuilding Cost of Revenues Land and other inventories include expenditures for land acquisition, land development, home construction, construction costs for amenities, and direct and allocated indirect costs, including interest cost capitalized until development and construction are substantially completed. These costs are assigned to components of land and other inventories based on specific identification, relative sales value, or area allocation methods. Land and other inventories are stated at cost unless the asset is determined to be impaired, in which case the asset is written to its fair value, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ("ASC 360"). 4 Homebuilding cost of revenues is comprised of direct and allocated costs, including estimated future costs for the limited warranty we provide on our homes. Land acquisition, land development and other common costs are generally allocated on a relative sales value or area allocation basis to the homes or lots within the applicable community or land parcel. Land acquisition and land development costs include related interest and real estate taxes. We evaluate our land and other inventories for impairment on a quarterly basis in accordance with ASC 360 to reflect market conditions, including a market-by-market consideration of supply of new and resale homes for sale, level of foreclosure activity and competition. For assets held and used, if indicators are present, we perform an impairment test in which the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If such cash flows are less than the asset's carrying value, the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value. Generally, fair value is determined by discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the asset and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in the determination of fair value would vary, depending on the state of development. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of the estimated future cash flows are based on expectations of future operations and economic conditions and certain factors described below. Changes to these assumptions could significantly affect the estimates of future cash flows, which could affect the potential for future impairments. Due to the uncertainties of the estimation process, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. During the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, our impairment assessments resulted in $0.1 million and $0.3 million of impairment charges, respectively, and are included in homebuilding cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, our impairment assessments resulted in no impairment charges. Receivables Receivables primarily consist of amounts in transit or due from title companies for house closings. Property and Equipment, net Property and equipment, net are stated at cost and depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets: land improvements 10 to 25 years; buildings and improvements 8 to 39years; and machinery, equipment and fixtures 3 to 7 years.Expenses for equipment utilized in the development of land are capitalized to land inventory while ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Property and equipment, net includes certain amenities such as club facilities on properties owned by us. These amenities include expenditures for land acquisition, land development, construction, and direct and allocated costs, including interest cost incurred during development and construction. Each reporting period, we review our property and equipment for indicators of impairment in accordance with ASC 360. For our amenities, which are located within our housing communities, indicators of impairment are similar to those of our housing communities (described above), as these factors may impact our ability to generate revenues at our amenities or cause construction costs to increase. In addition, we factor in the collectability and potential delinquency of the membership dues for our amenities. For the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015, we did not identify indicators of impairment for property and equipment. Investments in Partnerships and LLCs When we are either deemed to hold the controlling interest in a voting interest entity or deemed to be the primary beneficiary of avariable interest entity("VIE"), we are required to consolidate the investment. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb the majority of losses of the VIE or the right to receive the majority of benefits from the VIE. Investments where we do not hold the controlling interest and we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method. Factors considered when determining if we hold the controlling interest in a voting interest entity include who holds the general partnership or managing member interests, which partner or member makes the day-to-day decisions regarding the operations of the entity, and whether or not the other partners or members have substantive participating rights. With respect to VIEs, our variable interests may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets and/or (3) loans provided by us to the investor. We examine specific criteria and use judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partner(s), sufficiency of equity to conduct the operations of the entity, 5 voting rights, involvement in decisions significantly impacting the entity's economic performance, level of economic disproportionality between us and the other partner(s) and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs. We have investments in unconsolidated entities, including joint ventures, with independent third parties. The equity method of accounting is used for unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses of these entities. We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures ("ASC 323"). If we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Any such losses are recorded to equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. During the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015, we did not identify indicators of impairment for our investments in unconsolidated entities. Business Acquisitions When acquiring a business, we allocate the purchase price of the business to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values. In making estimates of fair values for this purpose, we use a number of sources, including independent appraisals and information obtained about each property as a result our pre-acquisition due diligence and its marketing and housing activities. Goodwill Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net fair value amounts that were assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. There were no indicators of impairment during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015. Homebuilding Revenue Recognition In accordance with ASC 360, homebuilding revenue and related profit from the sales of housing units are recognized when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In addition, revenues from land sales are recognized in full at closing, provided the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate, any financing is considered collectible and there is no significant continuing involvement. Sales Incentives When sales incentives involve a discount on the selling price of the home, we record the discount as a reduction of revenue at the time of house closing. If the sales incentive requires us to provide a free product or service to the customer, the cost of the free product or service is recorded as homebuilding cost of revenues at the time of house closing. This includes the cost related to optional upgrades and seller-paid financing costs, closing costs, homeowners' association fees, or merchandise. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs, sales commissions and closing costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Warranty Costs Warranty reserves for houses are established to cover estimated costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims to be incurred subsequent to the closing of a house. Reserves are determined based on historical data and other relevant factors. We have, and require our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, workers' compensation, and other business insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy limits. We may have recourse against subcontractors for certain claims relating to workmanship and materials. Warranty reserves are included in accrued and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 6 During the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015, changes in the warranty reserve consisted of the following (in thousands): Income Taxes Our income tax expense (benefit) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was less than $0.1million and $(110.0)million, respectively, compared to income tax expense of $0.0 million for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is due primarily to a $117.2million reduction of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the same period. Our effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors, the most significant of which is the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets. Due to the impact of the changes in the valuation allowance, our effective tax rates in 2016 and 2015 are not correlated to the amount of our income or loss before income taxes. Income taxes have been provided for using the asset and liability method under ASC 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"). The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes where deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is "more likely than not" that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required. ASC 740 requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a "more likely than not" standard. The realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. We established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets beginning in 2009 and regularly analyzed all available positive and negative evidence in determining the continuing need for a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets. This evaluation considered, among other factors, historical operating results, our three-year cumulative profit or loss position, forecasts of future profitability, and the duration of statutory carryforward periods. From 2007 to 2014, we generated significant deferred tax assets primarily from asset impairments and reduced operational profitability. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had net deferred tax assets of $117.2 million and $124.5 million, respectively. The December 31, 2015 net deferred tax asset was offset by a valuation allowance of $124.5 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2016,we recognized a decrease of $0.6 million in the valuation allowance generated from the pre-tax income for the period. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we evaluated both positive and negative evidence and determined it was "more likely than not" that our federal deferred tax assets and our state deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, we reversed $112.9 million of valuation allowance during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and an additional $4.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The valuation allowance decreased $117.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This reversal is reflected in our income tax benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). When a change in valuation allowance is recognized in an interim period, a portion of the valuation allowance to be reversed must be allocated to the remaining interim periods. The remaining valuation allowance of $6.7 million is expected to be reversed in the fourth quarter of 2016. Any interest or penalties assessed have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results. In the event we are assessed any interest or penalties in the future, we plan to include them in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as income tax expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we made income tax payments of $0.8 million and $0.0 million, respectively, related to alternative minimum tax and state income tax in North Carolina and South Carolina. 7 Share-Based Compensation On June 3, 2015, shareholders approved and we adopted the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2015 Plan"), which replaced the Amended and Restated 1997 Incentive and Capital Accumulation Plan (2011 Restatement), as amended (the "Incentive Plan"). Each of the Incentive Plan and 2015 Plan provide for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, performance awards, and stock units to officers, employees and directors of AV Homes. The exercise prices of stock options granted under the Incentive Plan or the 2015 Plan may not be less than the stock exchange closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock option awards under the Incentive Plan and 2015 Plan generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. As of September 30, 2016, there were an aggregate of 559,579 shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan and 35,483 shares reserved for future issuance relating to restricted stock units previously awarded and currently outstanding under the 2015 Plan. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016, for outstanding options and restricted stock units previously awarded under the Incentive Plan, an aggregate of 540,483 shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance. Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of AV Homes. The computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 did not assume the effect of employee stock options because the effects were antidilutive. The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 did not assume the effect of restricted stock, restricted stock units, employee stock options, or convertible notes because the effects were antidilutive. The following table represents a reconciliation of the net income (loss) and weighted average shares outstanding for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Comprehensive Income (Loss) Net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) are the same for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 because we do not have components of comprehensive income. 8 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 reduces the existing diversity in practice in financial reporting across all industries by clarifying certain existing principles in ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows , including providing additional guidance on how and what an entity should consider in determining the classification of certain cash flows. ASU 2016-15 may be effective for us for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018 and subsequent interim periods. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 will modify our current disclosures and reclassifications within the consolidated statement of cash flows but is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 will require organizations that lease assets - referred to as "lessees" - to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Under ASU 2016-02, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current GAAP. In addition, disclosures of leasing activities are to be expanded to include qualitative along with specific quantitative information. For public entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. As a result, the standard is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019 and mandates a modified retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements , which clarifies the treatment of debt issuance costs from line-of-credit arrangements after adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 ("ASU 2015-15"). ASU 2015-15 clarifies that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. We have applied the provisions of ASU 2015-15 to the capitalized deferred financing costs related to our Senior Secured Credit Facility. In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ("ASU 2015-02"). ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We have applied the provisions of ASU 2015-02 and there was no material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , which delayed the effective date by one year. As a result, the standard is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018 and allows for full retrospective or modified retrospective methods of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. Note 2 - Business Acquisitions Bonterra Builders Acquisition On July 1, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Bonterra Builders, LLC ("Bonterra Builders") for approximately $99.8 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. Part of the aggregate consideration includes a $6.0 million estimated earn-out. The actual amount of the earn-out may be more or less than the $6.0 million target amount based on the performance of the Bonterra Builders business through the end of 2016, of which $3.3 million has been paid as of September 30, 2016. A portion of the aggregate consideration equal to $0.8 millionwas held back by us at the closing as security for Bonterra Builder's indemnification and other potential obligations under the purchase agreement, of which $0.4 million has been paid as of September 30, 2016. Bonterra Builders acquires raw and developed land, develops raw land and constructs single-family homes in the Charlotte, North Carolina area. With approximately 1,700 lots owned or 9 controlled at the time of acquisition, Bonterra Builders significantly enhances our position in a key growth market. The results of Bonterra Builders operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date of July 1, 2015. The Bonterra Builders acquisition was accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"). We recorded the acquired assets and liabilities at their estimated fair value. We determined the estimated fair values with the assistance of appraisals or valuations performed by independent third-party specialists, discounted cash flow analyses, quoted market prices where available, and estimates by management. To the extent the consideration transferred exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired in this transaction, such excess was assigned to goodwill. Note 3 - Land and Other Inventories Land and other inventories consist of the following (in thousands): We capitalize interest to inventories during the period of development in accordance with ASC 835, Interest ("ASC 835"). Homebuilding interest capitalized to cost of inventory is included in cost of sales as related units or lots are closed. To the extent our homebuilding debt exceeds our qualified assets, as defined in ASC 835, we expense a portion of interest incurred. Qualified homebuilding assets consist of land, lots and homes that are under development or construction, excluding finished unsold homes or finished models. The following table represents interest incurred, interest capitalized, and interest expense for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): Note 4 - Investments in Unconsolidated Entities We participate in entities with equity interests ranging from 20% to 58% for the purpose of acquiring and/or developing land. We determine the method for accounting for our investment at inception or upon a reconsideration event. We share in the profits and losses of unconsolidated entities generally in accordance with our ownership interests. We and our equity partners typically make initial and ongoing capital contributions to these unconsolidated entities on a pro rata basis. The obligation to make capital contributions is governed by each unconsolidated entity's respective operating agreement or other governing documents. We made contributions totaling less than $0.1 million to our unconsolidated entities during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016. We made contributions totaling $0.0 million and $2.9million to our unconsolidated entities during the three and nine months ended September30, 2015, respectively. The balance of our investments in unconsolidated entities was $1.2 million as of September30, 2016 and December31, 2015. In May 2012, we entered into an agreement with JEN Arizona 4, LLC to form a limited liability company, EM646, LLC ("EM 646"). We hold a 58% interest in the venture, which was organized for the purpose of acquiring, entitling, developing, and distributing specific sections of real property located in Mesa, Arizona. The property was originally acquired in November 2012 and in April 2015 the final distribution of developed land to the partners was completed at cost. As of September30, 2016, EM 646 was financed by partner equity and does not have third-party debt. In addition, we have not provided any guarantees to the entity or our equity partner. The assets of our investee can only be used to settle obligations of the investee. 10 Note 5 Senior Notes Our senior notes are summarized as follows (in thousands): We made interest payments of $11.4million and $24.5 million for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, respectively. We made interest payments of $2.0 million and $24.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. We were in compliance with all debt covenants in our senior notes as of September30, 2016 and December31, 2015. 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes and 7.50% Senior Exchange Convertible Notes due 2016 On February 4, 2011, we completed an underwritten public offering for $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2016 (the "7.50% Notes"). The maturity date of the 7.50% Notes was February15,2016. The 7.50% Notes were governed by the Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture, each dated February 4, 2011, between us and the trustee named therein. Interest on the 7.50% Notes was payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year. In July 2012, we entered into exchange agreements under which we retired $44.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes, in exchange for the issuance of $44.5 million in aggregate principal of new 7.50% Senior Exchange Convertible Notes due 2016 ("7.50% Exchange Notes"). The maturity date of the 7.50% Exchange Notes was February15,2016. The 7.50% Exchange Notes were governed by the Indenture dated February 4, 2011 and the Second Supplemental Indenture dated July 25, 2012 between us and the trustee named therein. Interest on the 7.50% Exchange Notes was payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing February 15, 2013. In connection with the issuance of the 6.00% Notes (defined below), $20.5 million of 7.50% Exchange Notes and $8.7 million of 7.50% Notes were repurchased on June 23, 2015. On July 20, 2015, the remaining 7.50% Exchange Notes were redeemed, pursuant to our option to redeem such notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. On February 16, 2016, the remaining 7.50% Notes were repaid at maturity. 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 On June 30, 2014, we completed an underwritten offering for $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "8.50% Notes"). The 8.50% Notes mature on July 1, 2019, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Interest on the 8.50% Notes is 8.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2015. The 8.50% Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after July 1, 2016, at certain redemption prices, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Certain of our subsidiaries are guarantors of the 8.50% Senior Notes. All of the subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned by us, and all of the guarantees are full, unconditional, and joint and several. We have no independent assets or operations and our subsidiaries, other than the subsidiary guarantors, are minor. 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 On June23, 2015, we completed a private offering of $80.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 (the "6.00% Notes"). The proceeds of the 6.00% Notes were used to (i) repurchase 7.50% Exchange Notes and 7.50% Notes, and (ii) pay approximately $1.5 million of accrued interest (in respect of the notes being exchanged or repurchased) and premium (in respect of the notes being repurchased). The 6.00% Notes will mature on July1, 2020, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The 6.00% Notes are governed by the Indenture dated February4, 2011 and the Third Supplemental Indenture dated June 23, 2015 between us and the trustee named therein. The 6.00% Notes bear regular cash interest on the principal amount of each note, payable semi-annually in arrears on January1 and July1 of each year, beginning on January1, 2016. 11 The 6.00% Notes were issued pursuant a series of separate, privately negotiated note purchase agreements (the "Note Purchase Agreements") entered into on June17, 2015 by us and certain qualified institutional buyers. TPG Aviator, L.P. ("TPG"), purchased $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.00% Notes for $20.0million in cash and waived its rights to purchase additional 6.00% Notes, resulting in a fully diluted beneficial ownership for TPG of approximately 43.8% of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of our Related Person Transaction Policy, the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved the terms of the 6.00% Notes and TPG's purchase of 6.00% Notes. Senior Secured Credit Facility On April 7, 2014 we entered into a $65.0 million senior secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, a lender and a letter of credit issuer, which became effective on June 6, 2014 (the "Senior Secured Credit Facility"). The other original lenders and letter of credit issuers include Royal Bank of Canada and Credit Suisse AG. Later in 2014, we increased the Senior Secured Credit Facility by $40.0 million with the addition of Citibank, N.A., and Deutsche Bank, A.G., as additional lenders.The Senior Secured Credit Facility included revolving credit and letter of credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $105.0 million, with an "accordion" feature that allowed us, with the consent of the lenders, to increase the aggregate amount to $175.0 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also included a swing line loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $30.0million. On July 28, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facility and existing Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (the "Amendment"), which included the addition of Flagstar Bank, FSB and U.S. Bank, National Association as additional lenders. Pursuant to the Amendment, from the period beginning on July 28, 2016 and ending on June 5, 2017, the Amendment increases the committed amount available under the Senior Secured Credit Facility to $165.0 million. On June 6, 2017, Deutsche Bank, A.G.'s commitment will expire and the total committed amount available under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will be reduced to $150.0 million (the "Extended Commitments"). The Extended Commitments will expire on July 28, 2019 and any loans outstanding on such date will mature and be payable. In connection with the Amendment, the "accordion" feature was increased from $175.0 million to $200.0 million and the $30.0 million swing line loan facility was discontinued.As of September30, 2016, we had sufficient qualified assets in the borrowing base to cover the full $165.0 million capacity and had $15.0 million in borrowings outstanding. Note 6 - Estimated Development Liability The estimated development liability consists primarily of utility completion obligations in Rio Rico, Arizona and Poinciana, Florida for more than 8,000 home sites previously sold, in most cases prior to 1980. The estimated development liability is reduced by actual expenditures and is evaluated and adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect management's estimate of potential costs. In addition, we obtainthird-party engineer evaluations on an annual basis and adjust this liability to reflect changes in the estimated completion costs. Cash expenditures associated with these obligations were $0.2million and $0.3 million during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, respectively, and $0.1 million and $0.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Future increases or decreases of costs for construction, material and labor, as well as other land development and utilities infrastructure costs, may have a significant effect on the estimated development liability. The balance of the estimated development liability was $32.3million and $32.6million as of September30, 2016 and December31, 2015, respectively. Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies Legal We are involved in litigation from time to time, primarily arising in the normal course of our business. These cases are in various procedural stages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these legal and regulatory matters, we generally cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the pending matters, the related timing, or the eventual loss. While the outcome of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Surety Bonds Surety bonds, issued by third-party entities, are used primarily to guarantee our performance to construct improvements in our various communities. As of September30, 2016, we had outstanding surety bonds of approximately $28.3 million. The amount of outstanding surety bonds could fluctuate depending on the level of development activity. We do not believe that it is likely any of these outstanding surety bonds will be drawn upon. 12 Note 8 - Segment Information Our operating segments are defined as a component of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make operating decisions. We have identified our chief operating decision maker as our Chief Executive Officer. Our reportable segments are as follows: Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas. The following table summarizes our information for reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 (inthousands): 13 Note 9 - Fair Value Disclosures ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820") provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, expands disclosures about fair value measurements, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The accounting standards require that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Fair value determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2: Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, by correlation or other means. Level 3: Fair value determined using significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flows, or similar techniques. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, and accounts payable and the Senior Secured Credit Facility approximates the fair value due to their short-term nature. Certain assets are required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying amounts and fair values of our financial liabilities as of September30, 2016 and December31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands): (1) The carrying amount of the debt instruments are net of unamortized deferred financing costs and certain debt discounts. (2) During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid $4.3 million of the earn-out. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we also reduced the carrying amount of the earn-out by $0.4 million to its estimated fair value. In estimating the fair value of financial liabilities, we used the following methods and assumptions: 7.50% Notes, 8.50% Notes and 6.00% Notes As of September 30, 2016 and December31, 2015, the fair value of the 7.50% Notes, the 8.50% Notes and the 6.00% Notes is estimated, based on quoted or estimated market prices. These fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Contingent Consideration ("earn-out") This was first recognized as part of the purchase price paid for the Royal Oak Homes and Bonterra Builders acquisitions in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For the fair value as of December 31, 2015, valuation models were used to value the earn-outs by simulating earnings, applying the terms of the earn-out in each simulated path, determining the average payment in each year across all the trials of the simulation, and calculating the sum of the present values of the payments in each year. The primary inputs and key assumptions include estimated future earnings, probabilities of achievement, earnings volatility, and the discount rate. 14 Note 10 Subsequent Event On October 26, 2016, we received a commitment from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to become an additional lender under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, increasing the amount committed under the Senior Secured Credit Facility by $25 million. The addition of Wells Fargo to our Senior Secured Credit Facility is subject to customary closing conditions and we anticipate completing the addition in the fourth quarter. 15 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview We are engaged in the business of homebuilding and community development in Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas. We also engage to a limited degree in other real estate activities, such as the operation of amenities and the sale of land for third-party development. We manage our business through three reportable segments: Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas. For the nine months ended September30, 2016, we derived 51% of our revenues from Florida, 20% of our revenues from Arizona and 29% of our revenues from the Carolinas. Our primary business is the development of land and the construction and sale of homes for people of all ages, including active adults (55 years and older). Our current homebuilding sales activities include locations in Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas, with additional communities in the pipeline for each state. Within each geographical segment, we build both active adult communities, which are restricted to homeowners that are age 55 and older, and primary residential communities, which are open to all ages. This geographic and product segment diversification helps mitigate our overall business risks. We also opportunistically sell existing non-core commercial and industrial assets, as well as scattered lot positions and land assets, that are in excess of our needed supply in a given market. As of September30, 2016, our current selling community count included 63 locations, 28 in Florida, nine in Arizona and 26 in the Carolinas, with additional communities in the pipeline for each area. Our count of communities with closings as of September 30, 2016 included 60 locations, 26 in Florida, nine in Arizona and 25 in the Carolinas. Our active adult communities, Solivita and Vitalia, in Florida; CantaMia and Encore in Arizona; and Creekside at Bethpage in Raleigh, North Carolina currently serve as our flagship communities in the active adult market. These communities broaden our geographic footprint and product offering, and provide us with market participation in the longer term growth of demand from the wave of Baby Boomers entering their retirement years. We continue to invest in the primary residential market to create a more diversified portfolio that mitigates cyclical impact over time. Through homebuilder acquisitions and by acquiring new land and lot positions, we have expanded and continue to expand within our existing markets in Central Florida, Charlotte, Raleigh, Jacksonville and the greater Phoenix area. Replacement lot positions require new acquisitions of developed lots or platted or unplatted undeveloped land, or we may decide to develop current land holdings, depending on market conditions within the submarket of these assets. Our business is significantly influenced by a number of factors that affect our revenues, costs and capital expenditures. In managing our business and the influence of these factors, we track several key operating metrics described below. Key Operating Metrics Contracts signed . Net contracts signed for a given period represents the number of contracts we have entered into with home buyers for the purchase and sale of homes, less the number of contracts that were cancelled in the same period. We consider a home sales contract cancelled when the customer terminates the contract or when we provide notice of termination due to a failure on the part of the customer to close on the home or meet a contingency under the contract. Home starts . Home starts is the number of new homes on which we have started construction in a given period. Home starts are monitored by management in order to minimize the time between contract signing and home closing. Closings . Closings represents the number of home sales closed in the period. We recognize revenue equal to the sales price of a home when the sales are closed and title passes to the purchasers. Backlog . Backlog is the number of homes we are building that are under contract for sale that have not closed as of the end of the period being presented. The dollar value of backlog is the revenue anticipated to be realized at closing equal to the purchase price provided in the applicable contract. Backlog is an important indicator of home closings and homebuilding revenues in future periods. Average sales price . Average sales price represents total revenue for a given period divided by the number of closings for such period. 16 Seasonality Our quarterly operating results generally fluctuate by season. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in the winter and spring months, although new order activity is also highly dependent on the number of actively selling communities and the timing of new community openings and closings as well as other market factors. We may experience higher liquidity demands during the first half of the calendar year as we incur the costs associated with new construction resulting from the increased sales volume. If, due to construction delays or other reasons, we are unable to deliver our expected number of homes in the second half of the calendar year, our full year results of operations may be adversely affected. Results of Operations The following table provides a comparison of certain financial data related to our operations for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 17 Data from closings for the Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas segments for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Third Quarter 2016 Highlights During the third quarter of 2016, we continued to execute our strategic and operational business plan through (i) the continued deployment of existing capital into land and lot acquisitions, (ii) the development of existing land and lot positions, in addition to the construction of homes for sale, and (iii) the increase in the number of homes sold and closed. Three Months Ended September30, 2016 and 2015 Consolidated Results Overall revenue increased by $51.6 million or 33.5% to $205.4 million during the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September30, 2015. This increase was comprised of homebuilding revenue, which increased by $50.7 million or 33.5% compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in homebuilding revenue was driven by a 23.3% increase in units closed and an 8.5% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. Amenity and other revenue and land sales increased $0.9 million in total compared to the same period of 2015. Homebuilding Operations Homebuilding revenue, which is revenue from home closings, increased $50.7 million or 33.5% to $201.8million for the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a 23.3%increase in units closed and an 8.5% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. In the Florida segment, homebuilding revenue increased $10.1 million or 11.6% for the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily driven by a 7.3% increase in units closed due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from 21 to 26. In the Arizona 18 segment, revenues increased $22.0 million or 109.9% for the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 driven by an 81.7% increase in units closed primarily in our active adult communities and our communities that opened in 2015 and 2016. In the Carolinas segment, revenues increased by $18.6 million or 42.1% for the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from 22 to 25. Additionally, the average selling prices increased 4.0%, 15.6% and 8.9% for the Florida, Arizona and Carolinas segments, respectively, due to a combination of selective price increases and the mix of communities with closings, as many of the newly opened communities had average selling prices that were higher than the overall average for the segment. Gross margin from total home closings decreased by 110 basis points to 18.8% from 19.9% for the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Gross margin from the Florida segment increased by 150 basis points to 22.8% from 21.3% for the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Gross margin from the Arizona segment decreased by 150 basis points to 16.1% from 17.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to an increase in warranty expense as a result of the 2015 gross margin benefiting from the favorable impact of reduced warranty costs from older communities exiting the warranty period in 2015.Excluding the impact of warranty, gross margins were comparable between periods.Gross margin from the Carolinas segment decreased by 380 basis points to 14.4% from 18.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to increased construction and land development costs, a 160 basis point increase in previously capitalized interest and the mix of communities with closings. Capitalized interest included in cost of sales for the Florida, Arizona and Carolinas segments was $2.3 million, $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively, for the three months ended September30, 2016 and was $1.9 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for the same period in 2015. Total selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 12.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 15.3% for the same period in 2015. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 10.8% for the three months ended September30, 2016 from 12.8% for the same period in 2015 as we were able to continue to leverage the cost base over our increased revenues. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Florida segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue for the Florida segment improved to 12.6% for the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to 13.1% for the three months ended September30, 2015. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Arizona segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 9.2% for the three months ended September30, 2016 from 15.0% for the three months ended September30, 2015 primarily due to the cost leverage achieved from the more than doubling of revenue from the same period last year and lower sales and marketing costs. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Carolinas segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue for the Carolinas segment improved to 9.1% for the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to 11.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to leveraging our cost base over increased revenue. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million to $3.7 million for the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. As a percentage of homebuilding revenue, corporate general and administrative expenses improved to 1.8% for the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to 2.5% for the same period in 2015. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was driven by the increase in revenue, while containing our costs, and a $0.4 million decrease in our contingent consideration (earn-out) liability. Interest expense decreased by $1.1 million to $0.7 million for the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the decrease in outstanding debt in 2016 as compared to 2015. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was less than $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively. Net income for the three months ended September30, 2016 was $11.9 million or $0.49 per diluted share compared to net income of $5.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the three months ended September30, 2015. The increase in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the higher volume of closings, increases in average selling price and leveraging our cost base. 19 Nine Months Ended September30, 2016 and 2015 Consolidated Results Overall revenue increased by $225.6 million or 77.2% to $517.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was comprised of homebuilding revenue, which increased by $227.3 million or 81.1% compared to the same period of 2015, partially offset by a decrease in land sales revenue of $2.4 million. The increase in homebuilding revenue was driven by a 62.6% increase in units closed and an 11.3% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. The decrease in land sales is primarily due to non-recurring sales of non-core assets in Florida in 2015. Land sales can be highly variable from quarter-to-quarter and large fluctuations may occur. The gain on land sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.4 million compared to $3.1 million during the same period in 2015. Homebuilding Operations Homebuilding revenue, which is revenue from home closings, increased $227.3 million or 81.1% to $507.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a 62.6% increase in units closed and an 11.3% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. In the Florida segment, homebuilding revenue increased $66.1 million or 35.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 driven by a 28.4% increase in units closed due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from 21 to 26. In the Arizona segment, revenues increased $59.1 million or 130.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 driven by a 100.0% increase in units closed due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from eight to nine, and a significant increase in closings at newly opened primary residential communities and at one of our active adult communities. In the Carolinas segment, revenues increased by $102.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to the Bonterra Builders acquisition in July 2015. Additionally, the average selling prices increased 5.7%, 15.4% and 7.3% for the Florida, Arizona and Carolinas segments, respectively, due to a combination of selective price increases and the mix of communities with closings in each respective period. Gross margin from total home closings remained comparable at 18.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Gross margin from the Florida segment increased by 240 basis points to 22.1% from 19.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to cost reduction initiatives favorably impacting our construction costs and selective price increases. Gross margin from the Arizona segment increased by 150 basis points to 15.9% from 14.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to the addition of higher margin communities and selective price increases driving improvements in margins. Gross margin from the Carolinas segment decreased by 320 basis points to 14.0% from 17.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to increased construction and land development costs, a 160 basis point increase in previously capitalized interest and the mix of communities with closings. The Carolinas gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 also includes $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of expense associated with the purchase accounting write-up of the Bonterra Builders in-process inventory. Capitalized interest included in cost of sales for the Florida, Arizona and Carolinas segments was $6.1 million, $3.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and was $4.1 million, $1.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for the same period in 2015. Total selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 14.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 18.7% for the same period in 2015. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 11.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 14.5% for the same period in 2015 as we were able to continue to leverage the cost base over our increased revenues. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Florida segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue for the Florida segment improved to 13.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 14.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Arizona segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue for the Arizona segment improved to 10.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 17.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the cost leverage achieved from the more than doubling of revenue from the same period in 2015. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses for the Carolinas segment as a percentage of homebuilding revenue for the Carolinas segment improved to 10.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 13.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to the significant increase in revenue primarily from the acquisition of Bonterra Builders. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased by $0.2 million to $12.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. As a percentage of homebuilding revenue, corporate general and 20 administrative expenses improved to 2.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 4.2% for the same period in 2015. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was driven by the significant increase in revenue, while containing our costs. Interest expense decreased by $4.7 million to $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $7.5 million in the same period in 2015. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to a reduction in debt and an increase in capitalized interest due to an expansion of inventory under development in 2016 as compared to 2015. Income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $110.0 million from $0.0 million for the same period in 2015 due to the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the second and third quarters of 2016. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $130.0 million or $5.02 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $4.0 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to (i) the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance in the second and third quarters of 2016 and (ii) the higher volume of closings, increases in average selling price and leveraging our cost base, partially offset by a decrease of $2.7 million in land sale gains. Data from contracts signed for the Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas segments for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 The total number of net housing contracts signed during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased by 17 or 3.1%. The dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $21.5 million or 13.1% over the same period. The increase in units and value were driven by improvements in the Florida and Carolinas segments, partially offset by a decrease in Arizona. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Florida segment during the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 27 or 9.7%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $13.8 21 million or 18.3%, due to an increase in the number of selling communities from 24 to 28. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Arizona segment during the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 46 or 32.4%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed decreased by $8.5 million or 21.1%, due to a decrease in the number of selling communities from 10 to nine and two primary residential communities expected to close out in the next nine months. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Carolinas segment during the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 36 or 26.7%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $16.2 million or 33.6%, primarily as a result of improved demand at newer communities. The overall increase reflects an increase in the number of selling communities from 60 to 63 as well as higher average selling prices. The cancellation rate during the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to 17.0% from 15.9% compared to the same period in 2015. The cancellation rate in the Florida segment increased slightly to 18.2% from 17.0% over the same period. The cancellation rate in the Arizona segment during the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to 23.2% from 17.9% compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to an increase in sales contract cancellations associated with buyers unable to sell their existing homes. The cancellation rate in the Carolinas segment during three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased slightly to 10.5% from 11.2% during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 The total number of net housing contracts signed during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased by 408 or 26.6%. The dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $174.4 million or 40.1% over the same period. The increase in units and value were driven by improvements in the Florida and Carolinas segments. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Florida segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 77 or 8.0%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $33.9 million or 13.0%, due to an increase in the number of selling communities from 24 to 28. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Arizona segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 24 or 6.3%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $3.2 million or 2.9%, due to the sales mix of homes sold. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Carolinas segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 355, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $137.2 million, primarily as a result of the Bonterra Builders acquisition. The overall increase reflects an increase in the number of selling communities from 60 to 63 as well as higher average selling prices. The cancellation rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased slightly to 15.7% from 15.5% compared to the same period in 2015. The cancellation rate in the Florida segment increased slightly to 16.1% from 15.4% over the same period. The cancellation rate in the Arizona segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to 23.2% from 17.2% compared to the same period in 2015 due to an increase in sales contract cancellations associated with buyers unable to sell their existing homes. The cancellation rate in the Carolinas segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 9.0% compared to 12.4% during nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to the addition of Bonterra Builders communities, which typically focus on move-up buyers who tend to have a lower cancellation rate. Backlog for the Florida, Arizona and the Carolinas segments as of September30, 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): The backlog of housing contracts as of September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 increased by 55 or 5.4%, and the dollar value of backlog increased by $39.6 million or 12.9% over the same period. The increase in units of backlog was driven by increased sales due to higher community counts in the Florida and Carolinas segments, as well as increases in the 22 average price per unit sold due to price increases and the sales mix of product sold. The backlog of housing contracts in the Florida segment as of September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 increased by 20 or 3.7%, and the dollar value increased by $12.9 million or 8.8% over the same period, driven by the increase in selling communities from 24 to 28. The backlog of housing contracts in the Arizona segment as of September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 decreased by 13 or 4.9%, primarily due to a decrease in net housing contracts signed and the dollar value increased by $3.0 million or 3.9% over the same period, driven by a 9.0% increase in average selling price. The backlog of housing contracts in the Carolinas segment as of September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 increased by 48 or 21.1% and the dollar value increased by $23.7 or 29.0% million over the same period, primarily due the increase in the number of selling communities. As of September 30, 2016, our inventory of unsold (speculative) homes, both completed and under construction, was 403 units, as compared to 429 units as of September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 30% of unsold homes were completed compared to approximately 29% as of September 30, 2015. The decrease in speculative homes is due to our efforts to optimize our inventory of unsold (speculative) homes which typically have lower margins. The following is a breakdown of our land holdings as of September30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: (1) Estimated lots are based on historical densities for our land. New projects may ultimately be developed into more or less than the number of lots stated. In addition to the lots presented in the table above, we also have approximately 1,700 acres of commercial and industrial land and approximately 5,600 acres of unplatted scattered mixed-use land primarily in Florida. We also have 690 platted scattered lots, primarily in Arizona. Income Taxes Income taxes have been provided for using the asset and liability method under ASC 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"). The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes where deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is "more likely than not" that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required. ASC 740 requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a "more likely than not" standard. The realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. We established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in 2009 and regularly analyzed all available positive and negative evidence in determining the continuing need for a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets. This evaluation considered, among other factors, historical operating results, our three-year cumulative profit or loss position, forecasts of future profitability, and the duration of statutory carryforward periods. After careful evaluation 23 of all positive and negative evidence, and giving more weight to objectively verifiable evidence over more subjective evidence, we concluded as of June 30, 2016 that it was "more likely than not" that all of our federal deferred tax assets and our state deferred tax assets will be realized. Even if industry conditions weaken from current levels, we believe we will be able to adjust our operations to sustain long-term profitability. Accordingly, we reversed $112.9 million of valuation allowance during the three months ended June 30, 2016. We reversed an additional $4.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 for a total of $117.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. When a change in valuation allowance is recognized in an interim period, a portion of the valuation allowance to be reversed must be allocated to the remaining interim periods. The remaining valuation allowance of $6.7 million is expected to be reversed in the fourth quarter of 2016. Any interest or penalties assessed have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results. In the event we are assessed any interest or penalties in the future, we plan to include them in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as income tax expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary business activities are capital intensive in nature. Significant capital resources are required to finance planned active adult and primary residential communities, homebuilding construction in process, community infrastructure, selling expenses, new projects and working capital needs, including funding of debt service requirements, operating deficits and the carrying costs of land. We finance these capital needs through our cash on hand, operating cash flows, senior credit facility, senior notes and the capital markets. For more information regarding our debt, see Note 5, Senior Notes , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Cash Flows As of September30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $16.3 million compared to $46.9 million as of December31, 2015. As of September30, 2016, total consolidated indebtedness was $295.0 million compared to $326.8 million as of December31, 2015. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of September30, 2016 is primarily due to the purchase and development of land and the increase in homes under construction due to higher sales, the redemption of the 7.50% Notes and payments of outstanding amounts under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Additionally, as of September30, 2016, we had $1.1 million in restricted cash as compared to $26.9 million in restricted cash as of December31, 2015, which was comprised primarily of cash on deposit as an interest reserve to comply with the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was above the specified thresholds requiring the reserve. Our operating cash flows fluctuate relative to the status of development within existing communities, expenditures for land, new developments and other real estate activities, sales of various homebuilding product lines within those communities and other developments and to fund operating deficits. For the nine months ended September30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.8 million. The operating cash inflow was primarily due to the net income of $130.0 million offset by the $110.5 million decrease in deferred tax assets, net due to the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the second and third quarters of 2016. The remaining change was due to the increase in land and other inventories of $48.7 million, and an increase in customer deposits of $3.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $25.8 million related to the release of the interest reserve requirement for our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.4 million primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities was $36.1 million primarily due to the repayment of the remaining $46.8 million of 7.50% Notes at maturity, partially offset by a net draw of $15.0 million on the Senior Secured Credit Facility during the third quarter of 2016. 24 For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $112.4 million. The operating cash outflow was primarily due to the increase in land and other inventories of $121.2 million and an increase in restricted cash of $9.8 million related to a covenant requirement in our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Using the proceeds from our 8.50% Notes issued in June 2014 and our 6.00% Notes issued in June 2015, we purchased land and lots for the expansion of all our homebuilding segments and increased the number of homes under construction commensurate with the increase in our home sales. These outflows were partially offset by cash inflow of $19.7 million from increased customer deposits and accrued liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $99.1 million primarily due to the purchase of Bonterra Builders in the third quarter of 2015. Net cash provided by financing activities was $53.4 million primarily due to the issuance of $80.0 million of the 6.00% Notes, partially offset by the aggregate redemption and repurchase of the 7.50% Exchange Notes and portions of the 7.50% Notes for $55.0 million. Additionally, we had a net draw of $30.0 million on the Senior Secured Credit Facility during the third quarter of 2015. Other Assuming that no significant adverse changes occur in our business, we anticipate the aggregate cash on hand, cash flow generated through homebuilding and related operations, and the Senior Secured Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business for the next 12 months. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Performance bonds, issued by third-party entities, are used primarily to guarantee our performance to construct improvements in our various communities. As of September30, 2016, we had outstanding performance bonds of approximately $28.3 million. The amount of outstanding performance bonds could fluctuate depending on the level of development activity. We do not believe that it is likely any of these outstanding performance bonds will be drawn upon.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) March 31, 2017 Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AV Homes, Inc. and all subsidiaries, partnerships and other entities in which AV Homes, Inc. ("AV Homes," "we," "us," "our," or "the Company") has a controlling interest. Our investments in unconsolidated entities in which we have less than a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method.The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules andregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for complete financial statements. These statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of AV Homes as of March31, 2017 and for all periods presented. These statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in AV Homes' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2016. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of March31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were primarily in money market accounts that invest primarily in U.S. government securities.Due to the short maturity period of the cash equivalents, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximates their fair values. Our cash items that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage include deposits of $1.5 million and $1.2 million as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016, respectively. Receivables Receivables primarily consist of amounts in transit or due from title companies for house closings and for rebates. Land and Other Inventories and Homebuilding Cost of Revenues Land and other inventories include expenditures for land acquisition, land development, home construction, construction costs for amenities, and direct and allocated indirect costs, including interest cost capitalized until development and construction are substantially completed. These costs are assigned to components of land and other inventories based on specific identification, relative sales value, or area allocation methods. Land and other inventories are stated at cost unless the asset is determined to be impaired, in which case the asset is written to its fair value, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ("ASC 360"). Homebuilding cost of revenues is comprised of direct and allocated costs, including estimated future costs for the limited warranty we provide on our homes. Land acquisition, land development and other common costs are generally allocated on a relative sales value or area allocation basis to the homes or lots within the applicable community or land parcel. Land acquisition and land development costs include related interest and real estate taxes during the period of time under development. 4 We evaluate our land and other inventories for impairment on a quarterly basis in accordance with ASC 360 to reflect market conditions, including a consideration of supply of new and resale homes for sale in the respective market, level of foreclosure activity and competition. For assets held and used, if indicators are present, we perform an impairment test by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If such cash flows are less than the asset's carrying value, the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value. Generally, fair value is determined by discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the asset and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in the determination of fair value would vary, depending on the state of development. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of the estimated future cash flows are based on several factors, including expectations of future operations and economic conditions. Changes to these assumptions could significantly affect the estimates of future cash flows, which could affect the potential for future impairments. Due to the uncertainties of the estimation process, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. During the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, our impairment assessments resulted in $0.1 million and $0.2 million of impairment charges, respectively, and are included in homebuilding cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Property and Equipment, net Property and equipment, net are stated at cost and depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets: land improvements 5 to 15 years; buildings and improvements 3 to 40years; and machinery, equipment and fixtures 2 to 10 years.Maintenance and operating expenses of equipment utilized in the development of land are capitalized to land inventory. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Property and equipment includes amenities assets such as club facilities on properties owned by us. The cost of amenities assets includes expenditures for land acquisition, construction, land development and direct and allocated costs. Property and equipment owned and constructed by us also includes interest cost incurred during development and construction. Each reporting period, we review our property and equipment for indicators of impairment in accordance with ASC 360. For our amenities, which are located within our housing communities, indicators of impairment are similar to those of our housing communities (described above), as these factors may impact our ability to generate revenues at our amenities or cause construction costs to increase. In addition, we factor in the collectability and potential delinquency of the fees due for our amenity memberships. Forthe three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, we did not identify indicators of impairment for our property and equipment. Investments in Partnerships and Limited Liability Companies When we are either deemed to hold the controlling interest in a voting interest entity or deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE"), we are required to consolidate the investment. Factors considered when determining if we hold the controlling interest in a voting interest entity include who holds the general partnership or managing member interests, which partner or member makes the day-to-day decisions regarding the operations of the entity, and whether or not the other partners or members have substantive participating rights. With respect to VIEs, our variable interests may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets and/or (3) loans provided by us to the investor. We examine specific criteria and use judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb the majority of losses of the VIE or the right to receive the majority of benefits from the VIE. Investments, including joint ventures with independent third parties, where we do not hold the controlling interest and we are not the primary beneficiary, but over which we have significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses of these entities. We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures . If we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Any such losses are recorded to interest income and other in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant 5 volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. During the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, we did not identify indicators of impairment for our investments in unconsolidated entities. Business Acquisitions When acquiring a business, we allocate the purchase price of the business to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values. In making estimates of fair values for this purpose, we use a number of sources, including independent appraisals and information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence and its marketing and housing activities. Goodwill Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net fair value amounts that were assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. There were no indicators of impairment during the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016. Revenue Recognition In accordance with ASC 360, homebuilding revenue and related profit from the sales of housing units are recognized when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In addition, revenues from land sales are recognized in full at closing, provided the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate, any financing is considered collectible and there is no significant continuing involvement. Sales Incentives When sales incentives involve a discount on the selling price of the home, we record the discount as a reduction of revenue at the time of house closing. If the sales incentive requires us to provide a free product or service to the customer, the cost of the free product or service is recorded as homebuilding cost of revenues at the time of house closing. This includes the cost related to optional upgrades and seller-paid financing costs, closing costs, homeowners' association fees, or merchandise. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, advertising costs totaled $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Advertising costs, sales commissions and closing costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Warranty Costs Warranty reserves for houses are established to cover estimated costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims to be incurred subsequent to the closing of a house. Reserves are determined based on historical data and other relevant factors. We have, and require our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, workers' compensation, and other business insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy limits. We may have recourse against subcontractors for certain claims relating to workmanship and materials. Warranty reserves are included in accrued and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 6 During the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, changes in the warranty reserve consisted of the following (in thousands): Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, the most significant of which are the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and changes to tax laws or other circumstances that affect the value of our deferred tax assets. As a result, our effective tax rate in 2016 was not correlated to the amount of our income before income taxes. Our income tax expense for the first quarter of 2017 reflects a more normalized effective tax rate while there was a minimal tax provision for the first quarter of 2016 due to the continuation of our full valuation allowance. We evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is "more likely than not" that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods. We conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence. This evaluation considers, among other factors, historical operating results, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and the outlooks for the U.S. housing industry and broader economy. Based on our evaluation through March 31, 2016, we had fully reserved our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization. As of June 30, 2016, we determined that the valuation allowance against all of our federal and state deferred tax assets was no longer required. Accordingly, we reversed $112.9 million of valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2016 and the remaining $11.0 million over the third and fourth quarters of 2016. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between estimated and actual results could result in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Certain states enacted changes to tax laws that impacted the value of our deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2017. The estimated impact of such change was recorded to income tax expense during the period. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes. As of March 31, 2017, we had no unrecognized tax benefits. Any interest or penalties assessed have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results. In the event we are assessed any interest or penalties in the future, we plan to include them in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as income tax expense. Share-Based Compensation The Amended and Restated 1997 Incentive and Capital Accumulation Plan (2011 Restatement), as amended ("Incentive Plan"), and the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2015 Plan") provide for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, performance awards, and stock units to officers, employees and directors of AV Homes. The exercise prices of stock options granted under the Incentive Plan and the 2015 Plan may not be less than the stock exchange closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock option awards under the Incentive Plan and 2015 Plan generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. As of March 31, 2017, there were an aggregate of 439,179 shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan and 322,742 shares reserved for future issuance relating to stock options, performance share units, and restricted stock units previously awarded and currently outstanding under the 2015 Plan. Additionally, as of March 31, 2017, an aggregate of 490,483 shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance in connection with options and restricted stock units previously awarded under the Incentive Plan. 7 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of AV Homes. The computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 did not assume the effect of employee stock options or 6.00% Notes (defined below) because the effects were antidilutive. The following table represents a reconciliation of the net income and weighted average shares outstanding for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except per share amounts): Comprehensive Income Net income and comprehensive income are the same for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 because we do not have components of comprehensive income. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment ("ASU 2017-04"), which removes the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted, and applied prospectively. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2017 and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 reduces the existing diversity in practice in financial reporting across all industries by clarifying certain existing principles in ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows , including providing additional guidance on how and what an entity should consider in determining the classification of certain cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for us for the fiscal year and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 will modify our current disclosures within the consolidated statements of cash flows but is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. ASU 2016-09 is effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods beginning January 1, 2017. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements and forfeitures will be applied on a modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect 8 adjustment to equity as of January 1, 2017. We have applied the provisions of ASU 2016-09 and there was no material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 will require organizations that lease assets - referred to as "lessees" - to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Under ASU 2016-02, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current GAAP. In addition, disclosures of leasing activities are to be expanded to include qualitative along with specific quantitative information. ASU 2016-02 is effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019. The standard mandates a modified retrospective transition method. We continue to evaluate the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. The FASB has also issued a number of updates to this standard. The standard is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018. We expect to apply the modified retrospective method of adoption. We continue to evaluate the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. Note 2 - Land and Other Inventories As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, land and other inventories consisted of the following (in thousands): We capitalize interest to inventories during the period of development in accordance with ASC 835, Interest ("ASC 835"). Homebuilding interest capitalized to cost of inventory is included in cost of sales as related units or lots are closed. To the extent our homebuilding debt exceeds our qualified assets, as defined in ASC 835, we expense a portion of interest incurred. Qualified homebuilding assets consist of land, lots and homes that are under development or construction, excluding finished unsold homes or finished models. The following table represents interest incurred, interest capitalized, and interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): Note 3 - Investments in Unconsolidated Entities We participate in entities with equity interests ranging from 20% to 58% for the purpose of acquiring and/or developing land. We determine the method for accounting for our investment at inception or upon a reconsideration event. We share in the profits and losses of unconsolidated entities generally in accordance with our ownership interests. We and our equity partners typically make initial and ongoing capital contributions to these unconsolidated entities on a pro rata basis. The obligation to make capital contributions is governed by each unconsolidated entity's respective operating agreement or other governing documents. We made contributions totaling less than $0.1 million to our unconsolidated entities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and made no contributions during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The balance of our investments in unconsolidated entities was $1.2 million as of March 31, 2017 and December31, 2016. In May 2012, we entered into an agreement with JEN Arizona 4, LLC to form a limited liability company, EM646, LLC ("EM 646"). We hold a 58.2% interest in the venture, which was organized for the purpose of acquiring, entitling, 9 developing, and distributing specific sections of real property located in Mesa, Arizona. The property was originally acquired in November 2012 and in April 2015 the final distribution of developed land to the partners was completed at cost. As of March 31, 2017, EM 646 was financed by partner equity and does not have third-party debt. In addition, we have not provided any guarantees to the entity or our equity partner. The assets of our investee can only be used to settle obligations of the investee. Note 4 Senior Debt As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, senior debt, net consisted of the following (in thousands): 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 On June 30, 2014, we completed an underwritten offering for $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "8.50% Notes"). The 8.50% Notes mature on July 1, 2019, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest on the 8.50% Notes is 8.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2015. The 8.50% Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after July 1, 2016, at certain redemption prices, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Certain of our subsidiaries are guarantors of the 8.50% Senior Notes. All of the subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned by us, and all of the guarantees are full, unconditional, and joint and several. We have no independent assets or operations and our subsidiaries, other than the subsidiary guarantors, are minor. 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 On June23, 2015, we completed a private offering of $80.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 (the "6.00% Notes"). The proceeds of the 6.00% Notes were used to (i) repurchase 7.50% Senior Exchange Convertible Notes due 2016 and 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2016, and (ii) pay approximately $1.5 million of accrued interest (in respect of the notes being exchanged or repurchased) and premium (in respect of the notes being repurchased). The 6.00% Notes will mature on July1, 2020, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The 6.00% Notes are governed by the Indenture dated February4, 2011 and the Third Supplemental Indenture dated June 23, 2015 between us and the trustee named therein. The 6.00% Notes bear regular cash interest on the principal amount of each note, payable semi-annually in arrears on January1 and July1 of each year, beginning on January1, 2016. The 6.00% Notes were issued pursuant a series of separate, privately negotiated note purchase agreements (the "Note Purchase Agreements") entered into on June17, 2015 by us and certain qualified institutional buyers. TPG Aviator, L.P. ("TPG") purchased $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.00% Notes for $20.0million in cash and waived its rights to purchase additional 6.00% Notes, resulting in a fully diluted beneficial ownership for TPG of approximately 43.8% of our common stock at the time of the transaction. Pursuant to the terms of our Related Person Transaction Policy, the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved the terms of the 6.00% Notes and TPG's purchase of 6.00% Notes. Senior Secured Credit Facility On April 7, 2014 we entered into a $65.0 million senior secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, a lender and a letter of credit issuer (the "Senior Secured Credit Facility"). The other original lenders and letter of credit issuers include Royal Bank of Canada and Credit Suisse AG. Later in 2014, we increased the Senior Secured Credit Facility by $40.0 million with the addition of Citibank, N.A., and Deutsche Bank, A.G., as additional lenders. The Senior Secured Credit Facility included revolving credit and letter of credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $105.0 million, with an 10 "accordion" feature that allowed us, with the consent of the lenders, to increase the aggregate amount to $175.0 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also included a swing line loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $30.0million. On July 28, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facility and existing Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (the "Amendment"), which included the addition of Flagstar Bank, FSB and U.S. Bank, National Association as additional lenders, and on October 26, 2016, we received a commitment from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., increasing the amount committed under the Senior Secured Credit Facility by $25 million. Pursuant to the Amendment, and after giving effect to the commitment from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., the committed amount for revolving credit available under the Senior Secured Credit Facility was increased to $190.0 million. On June 6, 2017, Deutsche Bank, A.G.'s commitment will expire and the total committed amount available under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will be reduced by $15.0 million. The remaining commitments will expire on July 28, 2019 and any loans outstanding on such date will mature and be payable. In connection with the Amendment, the "accordion" feature was increased from $175.0 million to $200.0 million, the committed amount available under the letter of credit facilities was reduced to 50% of the total commitments in respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, and the $30.0 million swing line loan facility was discontinued. As of March 31, 2017, we had sufficient qualified assets in the borrowing base to cover borrowings of up to $177.0 million and had no borrowings outstanding. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Senior Secured Facility as of March 31, 2017 and December31, 2016. Note 5 - Estimated Development Liability The estimated development liability consists primarily of utility completion obligations in Rio Rico, Arizona and Poinciana, Florida for more than 8,000 home sites previously sold, in most cases prior to 1980. The estimated development liability is reduced by actual expenditures and is evaluated and adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect management's estimate of potential costs. In addition, we obtainthird-party engineer evaluations on an annual basis and adjust this liability to reflect changes in the estimated completion costs. Cash expenditures associated with these obligations were $0.1million and $0.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Future increases or decreases of costs for construction, material and labor, as well as other land development and utilities infrastructure costs, may have a significant effect on the estimated development liability. The balance of the estimated development liability was $32.0million and $32.1million as of March 31, 2017 and December31, 2016, respectively. Note 6 - Commitments and Contingencies Legal We are involved in litigation from time to time, primarily arising in the normal course of our business. These cases are in various procedural stages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these legal and regulatory matters, we generally cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the pending matters, the related timing, or the eventual loss. While the outcome of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Surety Bonds Surety bonds, issued by third-party entities, are used primarily to guarantee our performance to construct improvements in our various communities. As of March 31, 2017, we had outstanding surety bonds of approximately $41.6 million. The amount of outstanding surety bonds could fluctuate depending on the level of development activity. We do not believe that it is likely any of these outstanding surety bonds will be drawn upon. 11 Note 7 - Segment Information Our operating segments are defined as a component of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make operating decisions. We have identified our chief operating decision maker as our Chief Executive Officer. Our reportable segments are as follows: Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona. The following table summarizes our information for reportable segments for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (inthousands): 12 Note 8 - Fair Value Disclosures ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"), provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, expands disclosures about fair value measurements, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The accounting standards require that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Fair value determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2: Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, by correlation or other means. Level 3: Fair value determined using significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flows, or similar techniques. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, and accounts payable and the Senior Secured Credit Facility approximates the fair value due to their short-term nature. Certain assets are required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying amounts and fair values of our financial liabilities as of March 31, 2017 and December31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands): (1) The carrying amount of the debt instruments are net of unamortized deferred financing costs and certain debt discounts. (2) In April 2017, we made the final earn-out payment due in connection with the Bonterra Builders acquisition in the amount of $2.4 million. In estimating the fair value of financial liabilities, we used the following methods and assumptions: Senior Notes As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the fair value of the 8.50% Notes and the 6.00% Notes is estimated, based on quoted or estimated market prices. These fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Contingent Consideration ("earn-out") This was first recognized as part of the purchase price paid for the Bonterra Builders acquisitions in 2015and falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. At inception, the fair values were determined through the use of valuation models which simulated earnings, applying the terms of the earn-out in each simulated path, determining the average payment in each year across all the trials of the simulation, and calculating the sum of the present values of the payments in each year. The primary inputs and key assumptions include estimated future earnings, probabilities of achievement, earnings volatility, and the discount rate. 13 Note 9 Subsequent Event On April 3, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Savvy Homes, LLC and certain of its affiliated entities ("Savvy") forapproximately $45 million, including a $3 million estimated earn-out, and remains subject to customary post-closingadjustments. The actual amount of the earn-out may be more or less than the $3 million target amount based on theperformance of the Savvybusiness through the end of 2018. A portion of the aggregate consideration equal to $0.6 millionwas placed in a third-party escrowaccount as security for Savvy's indemnification and other obligations under the purchaseagreement. Savvy acquires raw and developed land, develops raw land and constructs single-family homes in the Raleigh,North Carolina area and enhances ourposition in a key growth market. As of the date of this report, the initial accounting for this business combination is incomplete because the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired is still in process; therefore, certain disclosures required by ASC 805, Business Combinations , cannot be made at this time. These disclosures include the amount of acquisition-related costs, the fair value of acquired receivables, the amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities acquired, the amount of goodwill recognized, if any, including qualitative discussion of the factors that make up that goodwill, the total amount of goodwill deductible for tax purposes, the amount of goodwill reportable by segment, the fair value and description of contingent consideration, and the amount of revenue and earnings of Savvy since the date of acquisition and since the beginning of 2016. 14 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview We are engaged in the business of homebuilding and community development in Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona. We also engage to a limited degree in other real estate activities, such as the operation of amenities and the sale of land for third-party development. We manage our business through three reportable segments: Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona. For three months ended March31, 2017, we derived 49% of our revenues from Florida, 31% of our revenues from the Carolinas and 20% of our revenues from Arizona. Our primary business is the development of land and the construction and sale of homes for people of all ages, including active adults (55 years and older). Our current homebuilding sales activities include locations in Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona, with additional communities in the pipeline for each region. Within each geographical segment, we build both active adult communities, which are restricted to homeowners that are age 55 and older, and primary residential communities, which are open to all ages. This geographic and product segment diversification helps mitigate our overall business risks. We also opportunistically sell existing non-core commercial and industrial land positions, as well as scattered lot positions and land assets, that are in excess of our needed supply in a given market. As of March31, 2017, our selling community count included 55 locations: 24 in Florida, 22 in the Carolinas, and nine in Arizona, with additional communities in the pipeline for each region. Our count of communities with closings included 57 locations:26 in Florida, 22 in the Carolinas, and nine in Arizona. Solivita and Vitalia in Central Florida; CantaMia and Encore in Arizona; and Creekside at Bethpage in Raleigh, North Carolina currently serve as our flagship communities in the active adult market. These communities broaden our geographic footprint and product offering, and should provide us with market participation in the long-term growth of demand from the wave of Baby Boomers entering their retirement years. We continue to invest in the primary residential market to create a more diversified portfolio that mitigates cyclical impact over time. Through homebuilder acquisitions and purchases of new land and lot positions, we have expanded and continue to expand within our existing markets in Central Florida, Charlotte, Raleigh, Jacksonville and the greater Phoenix area. Replacement lot positions require new acquisitions of developed lots or platted or unplatted undeveloped land, or we may decide to develop current land holdings, depending on market conditions within the submarket of these assets. Our business is significantly influenced by a number of factors that affect our revenues and costs, including market demand for new homes, labor supply and wages, materials prices, land availability and mortgage rates. In managing our business and the influence of these factors, we track several key operating metrics described below. Key Operating Metrics Contracts signed . Net contracts signed for a given period represents the number of contracts we have entered into with home buyers for the purchase and sale of homes, less the number of contracts that were cancelled in the same period. We consider a home sales contract cancelled when the customer terminates the contract or when we provide notice of termination due to a failure on the part of the customer to close on the home or meet a contingency under the contract. Home starts . Home starts is the number of new homes on which we have started construction in a given period. Home starts are monitored by management in order to minimize the time between contract signing and home closing. Closings . Closings represents the number of home sales closed in the period. We recognize revenue equal to the sales price of a home when the sales are closed and title passes to the purchasers. Backlog . Backlog is the number of homes we are building that are under contract for sale that have not closed as of the end of the period being presented. The dollar value of backlog is the revenue anticipated to be realized at closing equal to the purchase price provided in the applicable contract. Backlog is an important indicator of home closings and homebuilding revenues in future periods. 15 Average sales price . Average sales price represents total revenue for a given period divided by the number of closings for such period. Seasonality Our business is affected to some extent by the seasonality of home sales, which generally produce increased closings in the latter half of the year. However, periods of economic downturn in the industry can alter seasonal patterns. Results of Operations The following table provides a comparison of certain financial data related to our operations for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): 16 Data from closings for the Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona segments for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): First Quarter 2017 Highlights During the first quarter of 2017, we continued to execute our strategic and operational business plan through (i) the continued deployment of existing capital into land and lot acquisitions, (ii) the development of existing land and lot positions, in addition to the construction of homes for sale, (iii) the increase in the number of homes closed, and (iv) the sale of non-core land positions. Three Months Ended March31, 2017 and 2016 Consolidated Results Overall revenue increased by $31.5 million or 25.4% to $155.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. Homebuilding revenueincreased by $27.4 million or 22.6% compared to the same period in 2016 driven by a 7.9% increase in units closed and a13.8% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. Amenity and other revenue and land sales increased $4.0 million in total compared to the same period in 2016 driven mainly by the $2.2 million increase in land sales.Additionally, the gain on land sales during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $1.3 million compared to $0.1 million during the same period in 2016. Land sales can be highly variable from quarter-to-quarter and large fluctuations may occur. Homebuilding Operations Homebuilding revenue, which is revenue from home closings, increased $27.4 million or 22.6% to $148.7million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a 7.9%increase in units closed and a 13.8% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. In the Florida segment, homebuilding revenue increased $4.4 million or 6.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily driven by an8.4% increase in the average sales price for homes closed, partially offset by a small decrease in units closed. In the Carolinas segment, revenues increased by $13.3 million or 39.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a 27.1% increase in units closed driven by increased closings at our active adult community and newer communities which opened in late 2016 and a 10.0% increase in the average selling price of homes closed. In the Arizona segment, revenues increased $9.7 million or 44.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 driven by a 14.8% increase in units closed primarily in our active adult communities and our communities that opened in 2016; and a25.7% increase in the average selling price due to a combination of selective price increases and the mix of communities with closings. Gross margin, which is homebuilding revenue less homebuilding cost of revenues, from total home closings decreased by 90 basis points to17.4% from 18.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Gross margin from the Florida segment decreased by 80 basis points to 20.6% from 21.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016mainly due to higher land development costs. Gross margin from the Carolinas segment decreased by 60 basis points to 14.3% from 14.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to higher land development costs, partially offset bylower land acquisition costs. Gross margin from the 17 Arizona segment improved by 30 basis points to 14.7% from 14.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 mainly due to lower land cost basis in units closed. Capitalized interest included in cost of sales for the Florida, Carolinas and Arizona segments was $1.9 million, $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and was $1.5 million, $0.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for the same period in 2016. Total selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 15.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 16.8% for the same period in 2016. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue ("Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratio") improved to 11.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 13.4% for the same period in 2016 as we were able to continue to leverage the cost base over our increased revenues. Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratiofor the Florida segment improved to 13.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 13.9% for the same period in 2016. Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratiofor the Carolinas segment improved to 10.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 12.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 due to leveraging our cost base over increased revenue.Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratiofor the Arizona segment improved to 10.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 14.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily due to the cost leverage achieved from the 44.5% increase in homebuilding revenue and lower sales and marketing costs. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased by $0.6 million to $4.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. As a percentage of homebuilding revenue, corporate general and administrative expenses improved to 3.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 3.4% for the same period in 2016. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was driven by the increase in revenue, while containing our costs. Interest expense decreased by $0.4 million to $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in interest expense is due to no outstanding borrowings on the Senior Secured Credit Facility during the first quarter of 2017 compared to $35.0 million outstanding during the same period in 2016. Income before income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $4.2 million compared to $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the higher volume of closings, increases in average sales price for homes closed, leveraging our cost base and an increase of $1.2 million in land sale gains. Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1.7 million and $0.1 million,respectively. Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $2.4 million or $0.11 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to the higher volume of closings, increases in average selling price and leveraging our cost base. Data from contracts signed for the Florida, Carolinas and Arizona segments for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): The total number of net housing contracts signed during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016decreased by 18units or 2.6%. The dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $4.8 million or 2.3% over 18 the same period. The decrease in units was driven by the Florida and Arizona segments, partially offset by an increase in the Carolinas. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Florida segment during the three months ended March 31, 2017decreased by 17 units or 4.5%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed decreased by $0.6 million or 0.6%, due to a decrease in the number of selling communities from 26 to 24. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Carolinas segment during the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by 11units or 6.3%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $5.4 million or 8.3%, primarily as a result of the timing and launch of newer communities.The number of net housing contracts signed for the Arizona segment during the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased by 12 units or 9.4%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $0.1 million or 0.3%, due to communities that are expected to close out in 2017. The overall decreasein the number of net housing contracts signed reflects a decrease in the number of selling communities from 60 to 55,while the overall increase in the dollar value of housing contracts signed is due to an increase in the average sales price. The cancellation rate during the three months ended March 31, 2017decreased to 11.2% from 14.8% compared to the same period in 2016. The cancellation rate in the Florida segment decreased to 9.7% from 14.4% over the same period due to a higher mix of sales in our active adult communities in 2017 which tend to have lower cancellation rates. The cancellation rate in the Carolinas segment during three months ended March 31, 2017increased to 9.8% from 7.0% during the three months ended March 31, 2016,attributable to newer communities focused on first-time home buyers who tend to have higher cancellation rates. The cancellation rate in the Arizona segment during the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased to 17.7% from 24.3% compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to communities closing out in 2017 which had higher first-time home buyer volume in 2016. Backlog for the Florida, Carolinas and Arizona segments as of March31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): The backlog of housing contracts as of March 31, 2017 compared to March 31, 2016decreased by 148units or 14.1%, and the dollar value of backlog decreased by $29.7 million or 8.9% over the same period. The decrease in units was driven by decreased sales due to lower community counts in the Florida and Carolinas segments. The backlog of housing contracts in the Florida segment as of March 31, 2017 compared to March 31, 2016decreased by 87 units or 16.0%, and the dollar value decreased by $20.6 million or 13.2% over the same period, driven by the decrease in selling communities from 26 to 24 and the wind-down of additional communities expected to close out in 2017. The backlog of housing contracts in the Carolinas segment as of March 31, 2017 compared to March 31, 2016 increased by 27units or 11.8% and the dollar value increased by $15.6 million or 17.7% over the same period, primarily as a result of the timing and launch of newer communities in 2016. The backlog of housing contracts in the Arizona segment as of March 31, 2017 compared to March 31, 2016 decreased by 88 units or 31.4%, due mainly to a decrease in net housing contracts signed and the higher number of closings in 2016. The dollar value decreased by $24.6 million or 27.3% over the same period driven by slower sales in communities that are expected to close out in 2017. As of March 31, 2017, our inventory of unsold (speculative) homes, both completed and under construction, was 368 units, as compared to 341 units as of March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, approximately 30% of unsold homes were completed compared to approximately 36% as of March 31, 2016. The increase in speculative homes is mainly due to the timing and launch of newer communities in the Carolinas segment. 19 The following is a breakdown of our land holdings as of March31, 2017 and December 31, 2016: (1) Estimated lots are based on historical densities for our land. New projects may ultimately be developed into more or less than the number of lots stated. In addition to the lots presented in the table above, we also have approximately 1,700 acres of commercial and industrial land and approximately 5,200 acres of unplatted scattered mixed-use land primarily in Florida. We also have 689 platted scattered lots, primarily in Arizona. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, the most significant of which are the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and changes to tax laws or other circumstances that affect the value of our deferred tax assets. As a result, our effective tax rate in 2016 was not correlated to the amount of our income before income taxes. Our income tax expense for the first quarter of 2017 reflects a more normalized effective tax rate while there was a minimal tax provision for the first quarter of 2016 due to the continuation of our full valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2016, we determined that the valuation allowance against all of our federal and state deferred tax assets was no longer required. Accordingly, we reversed $112.9 million of valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2016 and the remaining $11.0 million over the third and fourth quarters of 2016. Certain states enacted changes to tax laws that impacted the value of our deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2017. The estimated impact of such change was recorded to income tax expense during the period. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary business activities are capital intensive in nature. Significant capital resources are required to finance planned residential communities, homebuilding construction in process, community infrastructure, selling expenses, new projects and working capital needs, including funding of debt service requirements, operating deficits and the carrying costs of land. We finance these activities using cash provided by operating activities, capital market financing and our senior secured credit facility.For more information regarding our debt, see Note 4, Senior Debt , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Cash Flows As of March31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $58.6 million compared to $67.8 million as of December31, 2016. As of March31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, total consolidated indebtedness was $280.0 million. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of March31, 2017 is primarily due to the development of land and the increase in homes completed or under construction. 20 Our operating cash flows fluctuate relative to the status of development within existing communities, expenditures for land, new developments and other real estate activities, sales of various homebuilding product lines within those communities and other developments and to fund operating deficits. For the three months ended March31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $8.1 million. The operating cash outflow was primarily due to (i) the $14.9 increase in land and other inventoriesas we further developed and completed our land and lots for delivery commensurate with the increase in our home closings; and (ii) the $8.9 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, primarily as a result of our semi-annual interest payment on our senior notes. These outflows were partially offset by our net income, a $4.6 million decrease in receivables, a $3.1 million decrease in customer deposits, and a $1.7 million decrease in our net deferred tax assets.Net cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment for model center furniture and fixtures in our Florida segment. Net cash used in financing activities was $0.4 million primarily due to the payment of withholding taxes on share-based awards. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $19.1 million. The operating cash outflow was primarily due to the increase in land and other inventories of $47.4 million and decrease in accrued liabilities of $7.6 million. Using the proceeds from our 8.50% Notes issued in June 2014 and our 6.00% Notes issued in June 2015, we purchased land and lots, including through the acquisition of the Bonterra Builders business, for the expansion of all our homebuilding segments and increased the number of homes under construction commensurate with the increase in our home sales. These outflows were partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $25.7 million related to the release of the interest reserve requirement for our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.3 million primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities was $11.9 million, primarily due to the repayment of the 7.50% Notes at maturity, partially offset by a draw of $35.0 million on the Senior Secured Credit Facility during the first quarter of 2016. Other Assuming that no significant adverse changes occur in our business, we anticipate the aggregate cash on hand, cash flow generated through homebuilding and related operations, and the Senior Secured Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business for the next 12 months. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Performance bonds, issued by third-party entities, are used primarily to guarantee our performance to construct improvements in our various communities. As of March31, 2017, we had outstanding performance bonds of approximately $41.6 million. The amount of outstanding performance bonds could fluctuate depending on the level of development activity. We do not believe that it is likely any of these outstanding performance bonds will be drawn upon.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) June30, 2017 Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AV Homes, Inc. and all subsidiaries, partnerships and other entities in which AV Homes, Inc. ("AV Homes," "we," "us," "our," or "the Company") has a controlling interest. Our investments in unconsolidated entities in which we have less than a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method.The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules andregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for complete financial statements. These statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of AV Homes as of June30, 2017 and for all periods presented. These statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in AV Homes' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2016. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of June30, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were primarily in money market accounts.Due to the short maturity period of the cash equivalents, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximates their fair values. Our cash items that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage include deposits of $1.4 million and $1.2 million as of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016, respectively. Receivables Receivables primarily consist of amounts in transit or due from title companies for home closings and for rebates. Land and Other Inventories and Homebuilding Cost of Revenues Land and other inventories include expenditures for land acquisition, land development, home construction, construction costs for amenities, and direct and allocated indirect costs, including interest cost capitalized until development and construction are substantially completed. These costs are assigned to components of land and other inventories based on specific identification, relative sales value, or area allocation methods. Land and other inventories are stated at cost unless the asset is determined to be impaired, in which case the asset is written to its fair value, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ("ASC 360"). Homebuilding cost of revenues is comprised of direct and allocated costs, including estimated future costs for the limited warranty we provide on our homes. Land acquisition, land development and other common costs are generally allocated on a relative sales value or area allocation basis to the homes or lots within the applicable community or land parcel. Land acquisition and land development costs include related interest and real estate taxes during the period of time under development. We evaluate our land and other inventories for impairment on a quarterly basis in accordance with ASC 360 to reflect market conditions, including a consideration of supply of new and resale homes for sale in the respective market, level of 4 foreclosure activity and competition. For assets held and used, if indicators are present, we perform an impairment test by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If such cash flows are less than the asset's carrying value, the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value. Generally, fair value is determined by discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the asset and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in the determination of fair value would vary, depending on the state of development. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of the estimated future cash flows are based on several factors, including expectations of future operations and economic conditions. Changes to these assumptions could significantly affect the estimates of future cash flows, which could affect the potential for future impairments. Due to the uncertainties of the estimation process, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. During the three and six months ended June30, 2017, our impairment assessments resulted in $0.1million and $0.2 million of impairment charges, respectively, and are included in homebuilding cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, our impairment assessments resulted in less than $0.1 million and $0.2 million of impairment charges, respectively. Property and Equipment, net Property and equipment, net are stated at cost and depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets: land improvements 5 to 15 years; buildings and improvements 3 to 40years; and machinery, equipment and fixtures 2 to 10 years.Maintenance and operating expenses of equipment utilized in the development of land are capitalized to land inventory. All other repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Property and equipment includes amenities assets such as club facilities on properties owned by us. The cost of amenities assets includes expenditures for land acquisition, construction, land development and direct and allocated costs. Property and equipment owned and constructed by us also includes interest cost incurred during development and construction. Each reporting period, we review our property and equipment for indicators of impairment in accordance with ASC 360. For our amenities, which are located within our housing communities, indicators of impairment are similar to those of our housing communities (described above), as these factors may impact our ability to generate revenues at our amenities or cause construction costs to increase. In addition, we factor in the collectability and potential delinquency of the fees due for our amenity memberships. During the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, we did not identify indicators of impairment for our property and equipment. Investments in Partnerships and Limited Liability Companies When we are either deemed to hold the controlling interest in a voting interest entity or deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE"), we are required to consolidate the investment. Factors considered when determining if we hold the controlling interest in a voting interest entity include who holds the general partnership or managing member interests, which partner or member makes the day-to-day decisions regarding the operations of the entity, and whether or not the other partners or members have substantive participating rights. With respect to VIEs, our variable interests may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets and/or (3) loans provided by us to the investor. We examine specific criteria and use judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb the majority of losses of the VIE or the right to receive the majority of benefits from the VIE. Investments, including joint ventures with independent third parties, where we do not hold the controlling interest and we are not the primary beneficiary, but over which we have significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses of these entities. We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures . If we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Any such losses are recorded to interest income and other in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. During the three and six 5 months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, we did not identify indicators of impairment for our investments in unconsolidated entities. Business Acquisitions When acquiring a business, we allocate the purchase price of the business to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values. In making estimates of fair values for this purpose, we use a number of sources, including independent appraisals and information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence and its marketing and housing activities. Goodwill Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net fair value amounts that were assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. There were no indicators of impairment during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016. Revenue Recognition In accordance with ASC 360, homebuilding revenue and related profit from the sales of housing units are recognized when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In addition, revenues from land sales are recognized in full at closing, provided the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate, any financing is considered collectible and there is no significant continuing involvement. Sales Incentives When sales incentives involve a discount on the selling price of the home, we record the discount as a reduction of revenue at the time of home closing. If the sales incentive requires us to provide a free product or service to the customer, the cost of the free product or service is recorded as homebuilding cost of revenues at the time of home closing. This includes the cost related to optional upgrades and seller-paid financing costs, closing costs, homeowners' association fees, or merchandise. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, advertising costs were$1.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, advertising costs were $0.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Advertising costs, sales commissions and closing costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Warranty Costs Warranty reserves for houses are established to cover estimated costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims to be incurred subsequent to the closing of a house. Reserves are determined based on historical data and other relevant factors. We have, and require our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, workers' compensation, and other business insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy limits. We may have recourse against subcontractors for certain claims relating to workmanship and materials. Warranty reserves are included in accrued and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 6 During the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, changes in the warranty reserve consisted of the following (in thousands): Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, the most significant of which are the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and changes to tax laws or other circumstances that affect the value of our deferred tax assets. Our 2017 effective tax rate approximates our blended statutory tax rate. Our income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 consisted primarily of the reversal of a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets. We evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is "more likely than not" that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods. We conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence. This evaluation considers, among other factors, historical operating results, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and the outlooks for the U.S. housing industry and broader economy. Based on our evaluation through March 31, 2016, we had fully reserved our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization. As of June 30, 2016, we determined that the valuation allowance against all of our federal and state deferred tax assets was no longer required. Accordingly, we reversed $112.9 million of valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2016. As of June 30, 2017, we do not have a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between estimated and actual results could result in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the realization of deferred tax assets over time.Certain states enacted changes to tax rates that impacted the value of our deferred tax assets in 2017. The estimated impact of such change was recorded to income tax expense during the period of change. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes. As of June 30, 2017, we had no unrecognized tax benefits. Any interest or penalties assessed have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results. In the event we are assessed any interest or penalties in the future, we plan to include them in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as income tax expense. Share-Based Compensation The Amended and Restated 1997 Incentive and Capital Accumulation Plan (2011 Restatement), as amended ("Incentive Plan"), and the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2015 Plan") provide for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, performance awards, and stock units to officers, employees and directors of AV Homes. The exercise prices of stock options granted under the Incentive Plan and the 2015 Plan may not be less than the stock exchange closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock option awards under the Incentive Plan and 2015 Plan generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. As of June 30, 2017, there were an aggregate of 1,417,885 shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan and 330,336 shares reserved for future issuance relating to stock options, performance share units, and restricted stock units previously awarded and currently outstanding under the 2015 Plan. Additionally, as of June 30, 2017, an aggregate of 490,483 shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance in connection with options and restricted stock units previously awarded under the Incentive Plan. 7 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of AV Homes. The computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 did not assume the effect of employee stock options or 6.00% Notes (defined below) because the effects were antidilutive. The computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 did not assume the effect of employee stock options because the effects were antidilutive. The following table represents a reconciliation of the net income and weighted average shares outstanding for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except per share amounts): Comprehensive Income Net income and comprehensive income are the same for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 because we do not have components of comprehensive income. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment ("ASU 2017-04"), which removes the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted, and applied prospectively. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2017 and there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 reduces the existing diversity in practice in financial reporting across all industries by clarifying certain existing principles in ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows , including providing additional guidance on how and what an entity should consider in determining the classification of certain cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for us for the fiscal year and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 will modify our current disclosures within the consolidated statements of cash flows but is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. ASU 2016-09 became effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods beginning January 1, 2017. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding 8 requirements and forfeitures were applied on a modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of January 1, 2017. The adoption of the provisions of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017 had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 will require organizations that lease assets - referred to as "lessees" - to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Under ASU 2016-02, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current GAAP. In addition, disclosures of leasing activities are to be expanded to include qualitative along with specific quantitative information. ASU 2016-02 is effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019. The standard mandates a modified retrospective transition method. We continue to evaluate the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. The FASB has also issued several updates to this standard. The standard is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018. We expect to apply the modified retrospective method of adoption. We continue to evaluate the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. Note 2 Business Acquisitions On April 3, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Savvy Homes, LLC and certain of its affiliated entities ("Savvy") for approximately $43 million, including an earn-out, which remains subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The assets acquired included substantially all of the real estate, land acquisition agreements and permits associated with the Savvy business, and certain of its leases, contracts, commitments and purchase orders. We also assumed certain liabilities of Savvy, including the liabilities and obligations relating to the acquired contracts, but excluding other liabilities including home warranty obligations relating to homes closed by Savvy prior to the acquisition.Savvy acquires raw and developed land, develops raw land and constructs single-family homes in the Raleigh, North Carolina area and enhances our position in a key growth market. The results of Savvy's operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date of April 3, 2017. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, Savvy's revenues and net loss were $17.5 million and $0.1million, respectively. The Savvy acquisition was accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"). We recorded the acquired assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values. We determined the estimated fair values with the assistance of appraisals or valuations performed by independent third-party specialists, discounted cash flow analyses, quoted market prices where available, and estimates by management. To the extent the consideration transferred exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired in this transaction, such excess was assigned to goodwill. 9 The following table summarizes the calculation of the fair value of the total consideration transferred to Savvy and its preliminary allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date (in thousands): Fair Value Receivables and other assets, property and equipment, accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities and customer deposits were generally stated at historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. We determined the fair value of land and other inventories on a lot-by-lot basis primarily using market comparable land and home sales transactions combined with our estimates related to expected average home selling prices and sales incentives, expected sales paces and cancellation rates, expected land development and construction timelines, and anticipated land development, construction, and overhead costs. Such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities. The fair values of identified intangible assets were determined using discounted cash flow models. The $0.4million of acquired intangible assets relates to trade names that are being amortized over 2.75 years. Amortization expense for these assets totaled less than $0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. We engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist with the determination of the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired.We estimated the preliminary fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition based on information available at that time. The valuation of these tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities is subject to further management review and may change between the preliminary allocation and end of the purchase price allocation period. Transaction and Integration Costs Transaction and integration costs directly related to the Savvy acquisition, including legal and accounting fees,were$0.6 million and $0.9million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Such costs were expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 805. 10 Goodwill As of the acquisition date, goodwill included the expected economic value attributable to Savvy's assembled workforce. The acquisition provided increased scale and presence in an existing market with immediate revenue opportunities through an established backlog. Supplemental Pro Forma Information The following represents pro forma operating results as if Savvy had been included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as of the beginning of the fiscal year presented (in thousands, except per share data): The supplemental pro forma operating results have been determined after adjusting the operating results of Savvy to reflect additional expense that would have been recorded assuming the fair value adjustments to inventory and intangible assets had been applied as of January 1, 2016. These results may not be indicative of future operating results. Note 3 - Land and Other Inventories As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, land and other inventories consisted of the following (in thousands): We capitalize interest to inventories during the period of development in accordance with ASC 835, Interest ("ASC 835"). Homebuilding interest capitalized to inventory is included in homebuilding cost of revenuesas related units or lots are closed. To the extent our homebuilding debt exceeds our qualified assets, as defined in ASC 835, we expense a portion of interest incurred. Qualified homebuilding assets consist of land, lots and homes that are under development or construction, excluding finished unsold homes or finished models. The following table represents interest incurred, interest capitalized, and interest expense for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): 11 Note 4 - Investments in Unconsolidated Entities We participate in entities with equity interests ranging from 20% to 58% for the purpose of acquiring and/or developing land. We determine the method for accounting for our investment at inception or upon a reconsideration event. We share in the profits and losses of unconsolidated entities generally in accordance with our ownership interests. We and our equity partners typically make initial and ongoing capital contributions to these unconsolidated entities on a pro-rata basis. The obligation to make capital contributions is governed by each unconsolidated entity's respective operating agreement or other governing documents. We made contributions totaling less than $0.1 million to our unconsolidated entities during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016. The balance of our investments in unconsolidated entities was $1.2 million as of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016. Note 5 Senior Debt As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, senior debt, net consisted of the following (in thousands): 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 On June 30, 2014, we completed an underwritten offering for $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "8.50% Notes"). The 8.50% Notes were scheduled to mature on July 1, 2019, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest on the 8.50% Notes was 8.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2015. The 8.50% Notes were redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after July 1, 2016, at certain redemption prices, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Certain of our subsidiaries were guarantors of the 8.50% Senior Notes. All of the subsidiary guarantors were100% owned by us, and all of the guarantees were full, unconditional, and joint and several. We have no independent assets or operations and our subsidiaries, other than the subsidiary guarantors, are minor. On May 18, 2017, in conjunction with the completion of our private offering of $400.0 million of the 6.625% Notes (as defined below), we repurchased $45.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 8.50% Notes representing approximately 23% of the total principal amount outstanding. Holders of the tendered notes received the total consideration of $1,038.87 per $1,000 principal amount of 8.50% Notes tendered, which includes an earlytender payment of $6.99 per $1,000 principal amount of 8.50% Notes tendered. In addition, holders of the tendered notes received accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including,May 18, 2017. In July 2017, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 8.50% Notes. See Note 10, Subsequent Event , for further discussion. 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 On June23, 2015, we completed a private offering of $80.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 (the "6.00% Notes"). The proceeds of the 6.00% Notes were used to (i) repurchase 7.50% Senior Exchange Convertible Notes due 2016 and 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2016, and (ii) pay approximately $1.5 million of accrued interest (in respect of the notes being exchanged or repurchased) and premium (in respect of the notes being repurchased). The 6.00% Notes will mature on July1, 2020, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The 6.00% Notes are governed by the Indenture dated February4, 2011 and the Third Supplemental Indenture dated June 23, 2015 between us and 12 the trustee named therein. The 6.00% Notes bear regular cash interest on the principal amount of each note, payable semi-annually in arrears on January1 and July1 of each year, beginning on January1, 2016. The 6.00% Notes were issued pursuant a series of separate, privately negotiated note purchase agreementsentered into on June17, 2015 by us and certain qualified institutional buyers. TPG Aviator, L.P. ("TPG") purchased $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.00% Notes for $20.0million in cash and waived its rights to purchase additional 6.00% Notes, resulting in a fully diluted beneficial ownership for TPG of approximately 43.8% of our common stock at the time of the transaction. Pursuant to the terms of our Related Person Transaction Policy, the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved the terms of the 6.00% Notes and TPG's purchase of 6.00% Notes. 6.625% Senior Notes due 2022 On May 18, 2017, we completed a private offering of$400.0 million of our 6.625% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "6.625% Notes"). The proceeds of the 6.625% Notes were used to (i) fund the repurchase and redemption of the $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 8.50% Notes, and (ii) pay amounts outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined below), totaling $30.0 million, and we intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of acquisitions. The 6.625% Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest on the 6.625% Notes is 6.625% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing November15, 2017. We have the option to redeem all or a portion of the 6.625% Notes at any time on or after May 15, 2019 at certain redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date of redemption. At any time prior to May 15, 2019, we have the option to redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of the 6.625% Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings by us at a redemption price of 106.625% of the principal amount of the 6.625% Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date of redemption, provided that at least 65% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 6.625% Notes remains outstanding after such redemption. Prior to May 15, 2019, we may redeem some or all of the 6.625% Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 6.625% Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date plus the applicable "make-whole" premium. The indenture governing the 6.625% Notes contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to (i) pay dividends, or make other distributions or redeem or repurchase our capital stock; (ii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; (iii) incur additional and guarantee indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) incur liens; (vii) sell assets; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all assets. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. Certain of our subsidiaries are guarantors of the 6.625% Notes. All of the subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned by us, and all of the guarantees are full, unconditional, and joint and several. We have no independent assets or operations and our subsidiaries, other than the subsidiary guarantors, are minor. In connection with the issuance of the 6.625% Notes, we entered into an agreement with the initial purchasers obligating us to file a registration statement with the SEC within 360 days so that the initial purchasers can exchange the 6.625% Notes and related guarantees with registered notes and guarantees having substantially the same terms. We have assessed the 6.625% Notes and concluded that the impact of any embedded derivative features are not material as of June 30, 2017. Senior Unsecured Credit Facility On May 18, 2017, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "Senior Unsecured Credit Facility") with each of the financial institutions party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and Citibank, N.A., as syndication agent. As of June 30, 2017, the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility had replaced the previously outstanding Senior Secured Credit Facility, as more fully described below. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility has substantially similar terms and provisions to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, except that the facility is no longer secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of certain of our subsidiaries. 13 The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility includes a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $155.0 million, with an "accordion" feature that allows us, with the consent of the lenders, to increase the aggregate amount to $250.0 million. The facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility in an amount equal to 50% of total commitments then in effect. The maximum amount available under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is limited to the lesser of (i) $155.0 million (subject to increase pursuant to the "accordion") and (ii) an amount equal to the borrowing base minus our consolidated senior debt. The borrowing base includes 100% of unrestricted cash, to the extent it exceeds the interest reserve, and escrowed deposits and funds payable to us following the sale of real property, plus the following, subject to certain limitations: 85% of the book value of our real property that is under contract or under construction and is or is planned to be residential housing units or model homes; plus 65% of the book value of our finished lots and lots under development; plus 50% of the book value of our entitled lands that are not finished lots or lots under development. To be included in the borrowing base, the real property must be owned by us or one of our subsidiaries that guarantees the Company's obligations under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and meet certain criteria.As of June30, 2017, we had sufficient qualified assets in the borrowing base to cover borrowings of up to $155.0 million and had no borrowings outstanding. Interest will be payable on revolving credit borrowings at variable rates determined by the applicable LIBOR plus 3.25% or the prime rate plus 2.25%, at our election. We pay quarterly fees of 0.50% per annum on the unused portion of the lenders' commitments under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility to the lenders. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility expires on July 28, 2020. Upon expiration, all borrowings become due and payable. We may prepay loans borrowed under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility or reduce the commitments thereunder at our option, without any prepayment fee or penalty. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and we have the option to add or remove guarantors from time to time, subject to certain limitations. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility contains certain restrictions and covenants, which, among other things, restrict our ability to acquire or merge with another entity, make investments, loans or guarantees, incur additional indebtedness, create liens or other encumbrances, or pay cash dividends or make other distributions. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility also requires that we comply with the following financial covenants as of the end of each fiscal quarter: our leverage ratio may not exceed 60%; if our interest coverage ratio is less than 1.50 to 1.00, we must deposit to an interest reserve account an amount equal to the interest we have incurred on all indebtedness during the prior twelve months; and our consolidated tangible net worth, excluding the tangible net worth of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility unless such subsidiaries are a subsidiary of a guarantor, must be at least $325.1 million plus 50% of our cumulative consolidated net income since December 31, 2016 plus 50% of the net proceeds of any equity offerings. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of June 30, 2017. Senior Secured Credit Facility On April 7, 2014 we entered into a $65.0 million senior secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, a lender and a letter of credit issuer (the "Senior Secured Credit Facility"). The other original lenders and letter of credit issuers include Royal Bank of Canada and Credit Suisse AG. Later in 2014, we increased the Senior Secured Credit Facility by $40.0million with the addition of Citibank, N.A., and Deutsche Bank, A.G., as additional lenders. The Senior Secured Credit Facility included revolving credit and letter of credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $105.0 million, with an "accordion" feature that allowed us, with the consent of the lenders, to increase the aggregate amount to $175.0 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also included a swing line loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $30.0million. 14 On July 28, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facility and existing Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (the "Amendment"), which included the addition of Flagstar Bank, FSB and U.S. Bank, NationalAssociation as additional lenders, and on October 26, 2016, we received a commitment from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., increasing the amount committed under the Senior Secured Credit Facility by$25 million. Pursuant to the Amendment, and after giving effect to the commitment from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., the committed amount for revolving credit available under the Senior Secured Credit Facility was increased to $190.0 million. On June 6, 2017, Deutsche Bank, A.G.'s commitment would have expired and the total committed amount available under the Senior Secured Credit Facility would have been reduced by $15.0 million. Theremaining commitments were scheduled to expire on July 28, 2019 and any loans outstanding on such date would mature and be payable. In connection with the Amendment, the "accordion" feature was increased from $175.0 million to $200.0 million, the committed amount available under the letter of credit facilities was reduced to 50% of the total commitments in respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, and the $30.0 million swing line loan facility was discontinued. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Senior Secured Facility as of December31, 2016. Note 6 - Estimated Development Liability The estimated development liability consists primarily of utility completion obligations in Rio Rico, Arizona and Poinciana, Florida for more than 8,000 home sites previously sold, in most cases prior to 1980. The estimated development liability is reduced by actual expenditures and is evaluated and adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect management's estimate of potential costs. In addition, we obtainthird-party engineer evaluations on an annual basis and adjust this liability to reflect changes in the estimated completion costs. Cash expenditures associated with these obligations were $0.2million and $0.3 million during the three and six months ended June30, 2017, respectively, and was$0.1 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. Future increases or decreases of costs for construction, material and labor, as well as other land development and utilities infrastructure costs, may have a significant effect on the estimated development liability. The balance of the estimated development liability was $31.8million and $32.1million as of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016, respectively. Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies Legal We are involved in litigation from time to time, primarily arising in the normal course of our business. These cases are in various procedural stages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these legal and regulatory matters, we generally cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the pending matters, the related timing, or the eventual loss. While the outcome of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Surety Bonds Surety bonds, issued by third-party entities, are used primarily to guarantee our performance to construct improvements in our various communities. As of June30, 2017, we had outstanding surety bonds of approximately $40.3 million. The amount of outstanding surety bonds could fluctuate depending on the level of development activity. We do not believe that it is likely any of these outstanding surety bonds will be drawn upon. 15 Note 8 - Segment Information Our operating segments are defined as a component of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make operating decisions. We have identified our chief operating decision maker as our Chief Executive Officer. Our reportable segments are as follows: Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona. The following table summarizes our information for reportable segments for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 (inthousands): 16 Note 9 - Fair Value Disclosures ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"), provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, expands disclosures about fair value measurements, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The accounting standards require that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Fair value determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2: Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, by correlation or other means. Level 3: Fair value determined using significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flows, or similar techniques. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, accounts payable,the Senior Secured Credit Facility, and the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility approximates the fair value due to their short-term nature. Certain assets are required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying amounts and fair values of our financial liabilities as of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands): (1) The carrying amount of the debt instruments are net of unamortized deferred financing costs and certain debt discounts. (2) In April 2017, we made the final earn-out payment due in connection with the Bonterra Builders acquisition in the amount of $2.4 million. In estimating the fair value of financial liabilities, we used the following methods and assumptions: Senior Notes As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the fair values of the 8.50% Notes, 6.00% Notes and 6.625% Notes are estimated, based on quoted or estimated market prices. These fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Contingent Consideration ("earn-out") This was recognized as part of the purchase price paid for the Bonterra Builders acquisition in 2015and the Savvy acquisition. At inception, the fair values were determined through the use of valuation models which simulated earnings, applying the terms of the earn-out in each simulated path, determining the average payment in each year across all the trials of the simulation, and calculating the present values of the future payments. The primary inputs and key assumptions include estimated future earnings, probabilities of achievement, earnings volatility, and the discount rate. These fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 17 Note 10 Subsequent Event Effective July 1, 2017, we redeemed the remaining $154.5 million principal of our 8.50% Notes. As a result, we expect to recognize a loss on extinguishment of debt of $6.9 million in the third quarter of 2017, which includes a redemption premium of $4.9 million and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. 18 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview We are engaged in the business of homebuilding and community development in Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona. We also engage to a limited degree in other real estate activities, such as the operation of amenities and the sale of land for third-party development. We manage our business through three reportable segments: Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona. For the six months ended June30, 2017, we derived 45% of our revenues from Florida, 36% of our revenues from the Carolinas and 19% of our revenues from Arizona. Our primary business is the development of land and the construction and sale of homes. Our current homebuilding sales activities include locations in Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona, with additional communities in the pipeline for each region. Within each geographical segment, we build both active adult communities, which are restricted to homeowners that are age 55 and older, and primary residential communities, which are open to all ages. This geographic and product segment diversification helps mitigate our overall business risks. We also opportunistically sell existing non-core commercial and industrial land positions, as well as scattered lot positions and land assets, that are in excess of our needed supply in a given market. As of June30, 2017, our selling community count included 71 locations: 25 in Florida, 38 in the Carolinas, and eight in Arizona, with additional communities in the pipeline for each region. Our count of communities with closings as of June 30, 2017 included 66 locations:22 in Florida, 35 in the Carolinas, and nine in Arizona. Solivita and Vitalia in Central Florida; CantaMia and Encore in Arizona; and Creekside at Bethpage in Raleigh, North Carolina currently serve as our flagship communities in the active adult market. These communities broaden our geographic footprint and product offering, and should provide us with market participation in the long-term growth of demand from the wave of Baby Boomers entering their retirement years. We continue to invest in new and existing markets to create a more diversified portfolio that mitigates cyclical impact over time. Through homebuilder acquisitions and purchases of new land and lot positions, we have expanded and continue to expand within our existing markets in Central Florida, Charlotte, Raleigh, Jacksonville and the greater Phoenix area. Replacement lot positions require new acquisitions of developed lots or platted or unplatted undeveloped land, or we may decide to develop current land holdings, depending on market conditions within the submarket of these assets. Our business is significantly influenced by a number of factors that affect our revenues and costs, including market demand for new homes, labor supply and wages, materials prices and availability, land availability, and mortgage rates and availability. In managing our business and the influence of these factors, we track several key operating metrics described below. Key Operating Metrics Contracts signed . Net contracts signed for a given period represents the number of contracts we have entered into with home buyers for the purchase and sale of homes, less the number of contracts that were cancelled in the same period. We consider a home sales contract cancelled when the customer terminates the contract or when we provide notice of termination due to a failure on the part of the customer to close on the home or meet a contingency under the contract. Home starts . Home starts is the number of new homes on which we have started construction in a given period. Home starts are monitored by management in order to minimize the time between contract signing and home closing. Closings . Closings represents the number of home sales closed in the period. We recognize revenue equal to the sales price of a home when the sales are closed and title passes to the purchasers. Backlog . Backlog is the number of homes we are building that are under contract for sale that have not closed as of the end of the period being presented. The dollar value of backlog is the revenue anticipated to be realized at closing equal to the purchase price provided in the applicable contract. Backlog is an important indicator of home closings and homebuilding revenues in future periods. Average sales price . Average sales price represents total revenue for a given period divided by the number of closings for such period. 19 Seasonality Our business is affected to some extent by the seasonality of home sales, which generally produce increased closings in the latter half of the year. However, periods of economic downturn in the industry can alter seasonal patterns. Results of Operations The following table provides a comparison of certain financial data related to our operations for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): 20 Data from closings for the Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona segments for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Second Quarter 2017 Highlights During the second quarter of 2017, we continued to execute our strategic and operational business plan through (i) the acquisition of Savvy, (ii) the deployment of capital into land and additional lot acquisitions, (iii) the development of existing land and lot positions, in addition to the construction of homes for sale, and (iv) the sale of non-core land positions. Three Months Ended June30, 2017 and 2016 Overall revenue increased by $13.1 million or 7.0% to $201.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016. Homebuilding revenue, which is revenue from home closings, increased $12.3 million or 6.7% to $196.9million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the Savvy acquisition, a 6.4% increase in the average sales price for homes closed, and offsetting volume declines in Florida and Arizona. In the Florida segment, homebuilding revenue decreased $9.5 million or 10.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to a decrease in the number of communities in which we had closings from 26 to 22. In the Carolinas segment, revenues increased by $27.1 million or 48.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from 24 to 35, primarily as a result of the Savvy acquisition. In the Arizona segment, revenues decreased $5.3 million or 13.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 driven by a 17.7% decrease in units closed primarily in our active adult communities, partially offset by a 5.4% increase in the average selling price of homes closed. Gross margin, which is homebuilding revenue less homebuilding cost of revenues, from total home closings decreased by 60 basis points to 17.4% from 18.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Gross margin from the Florida segment decreased by 100 basis points to 20.8% from 21.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 21 compared to the same period in 2016,primarily due to the change in the mix of communities with home closings in each year, as well asan increase in option and construction costs. Gross margin from the Carolinas segment increased by 210 basis points to 15.1% from 13.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the change in the mix of communities with home closings and the effects of purchase accounting inventory valuations in each year. Gross margin from the Arizona segment decreased by 130 basis points to 15.2% from 16.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 mainly due to lower margins in close-out communities and increased construction costs. Capitalized interest included in cost of sales for the Florida, Carolinas and Arizona segments was $2.0 million, $2.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and was $2.2 million, $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively, for the same period in 2016. Total selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 13.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from 14.0% for the same period in 2016. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue ("Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratio") improved to 11.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from 11.7% for the same period in 2016 as we were able to continue to leverage the cost base over our increased revenues. The Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratio for the Florida segment improved to 11.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 13.5% for the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower external commission costs resulting from a decline in home closing volume and a decline in general and administrative expenses for the period. The Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratio for the Carolinas segment increased to 11.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 10.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to higher external commission costs. The Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratiofor the Arizona segment increased to 10.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from 9.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to lower revenue over a fixed cost base. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased by $0.8 million to $5.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. As a percentage of homebuilding revenue, corporate general and administrative expenses increased to 2.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2.3% for the same period in 2016. The increase as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by $0.6 million of transaction and integration costs directly related to the Savvy acquisition. Interest expense increased by $2.8 million to $3.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in interest expense is a result of the temporary increase in debt due to the issuance of the $400.0 million of 6.625% Notes in May 2017 plus the remaining outstanding principal of $154.5 million of 8.50% Notes, which were subsequently redeemed effective July 1, 2017. Income before income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $1.5 million compared to $7.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to (i)the $2.9 million loss on extinguishment associated with the repurchase of our 8.50% Notes and the replacement of our Senior Secured Credit Facility in the second quarter of 2017, (ii) the $3.7 million of interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $0.9 million for the same period in 2016 due to the issuance of the 6.625% Notes in May 2017, and (iii) the $0.6 million of acquisition-related costs. Income tax expense (benefit) for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 was $0.8 million and $(110.1) million, respectively. The income tax benefit in 2016 was due to the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the period. Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $0.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared to net income of $117.4 million or $4.45 per diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in net income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt, increased interest expense, and a $110.1 million income tax benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2016. 22 Six Months Ended June30, 2017 and 2016 Overall revenue increased by $44.6 million or 14.3% to $356.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. Homebuilding revenue, which is revenue from home closings, increased $39.7 million or 13.0% to $345.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a 3.4%increase in units closed and a 9.4% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. In the Florida segment, homebuilding revenue decreased $5.0 million or 3.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily driven by a decrease in the number of communities in which we had closings from 26 to 22. In the Carolinas segment, revenues increased by $40.4 million or 45.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to an increase in the number of communities in which we had closings from 24 to 35, primarily as a result of the Savvy acquisition. In the Arizona segment, revenues increased $4.3 million or 7.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 driven by a 12.9% increase in the average selling price due to a combination of selective price increases and the mix of communities with closings, partially offset by a 5.2% decline in units closed. Gross margin, which is homebuilding revenue less homebuilding cost of revenues, from total home closings decreased by 70 basis points to 17.4% from 18.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Gross margin from the Florida segment decreased by 90 basis points to 20.7% from 21.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 mainly due to the change in mix of communities with home closings in each year and increased construction costs.

The Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratio improved to 11.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 from 12.4% for the same period in 2016 as we were able to continue to leverage the cost base over our increased revenues. The Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratio for the Florida segment improved to 12.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 13.7% for the same period in 2016 due to lower external commission costs resulting from a decline in home closing volume. The Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratio for the Carolinas segment improved to10.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 from11.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratiofor the Arizona segment improved to 10.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 from 11.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to the cost leverage achieved from the 7.0% increase in homebuilding revenue.

Income before income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $5.6 million compared to $8.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to (i) the $2.9 million loss on extinguishment associated with the repurchase of our 8.50% Notes and the replacement of our Senior Secured Credit Facility in the second quarter of 2017, (ii) the $4.5 million of interest expense during the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2016 due to the issuance of the 6.625% Notes in May 2017, and (iii) the $0.9 million of acquisition-related costs.

Data from contracts signed for the Florida, Carolinas and Arizona segments for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 The total number of net housing contracts signed during the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 increased by six units or 0.9%. The dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $10.4 million or 4.9% over the same period. The increase in units was driven by the Florida and Carolina segments, partially offset by a decrease in Arizona. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Florida segment during the three months ended June 30, 2017 increased by 10 units or 2.8%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $9.1 million or 9.2%, due to timing and launch of newer communities. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Carolinas segment during the three months ended June 30, 2017 increased by 14 units or 7.3%, primarily as a result of the Savvy acquisition, net of lower sales volume in Charlotte, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $5.3 million or 7.5%. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Arizona segment during the three months ended June 30, 2017 decreased by 18 units or 13.5%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed decreased by $4.1 million or 9.7%, due to lower volumes at communities that are expected to close out in 2017. The overall increase in the number of net housing contracts signed reflects an increase in the number of selling communities from 62 to 71 mainly due to the Savvy acquisition, while the overall increase in the dollar value of housing contracts signed is due to an increase in the average sales price. The cancellation rate during the three months ended June 30, 2017 decreased to 11.6% from 15.6% compared to the same period in 2016. The cancellation rate in the Florida segment decreased to 8.9% from 16.1% over the same period due to certain 24 closed out communities that had higher cancellation rates in the prior period. The cancellation rate in the Carolinas segment during three months ended June 30, 2017 increased to 12.3% from 9.4% during the three months ended June 30, 2016, attributable to newer communities focused on first-time home buyers who tend to have higher cancellation rates. The cancellation rate in the Arizona segment during the three months ended June 30, 2017 decreased to 18.4% from 22.2% compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to communities closing out in 2017 that had higher first-time home buyer volume in 2016. Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 The total number of net housing contracts signed during the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 decreased by 12 units or 0.9%. The dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $15.2 million or 3.6% over the same period. The decrease in units was driven by the Florida and Arizona segments, partially offset by an increase in the Carolinas. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Florida segment during the six months ended June 30, 2017 decreased by seven units or 0.9%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $8.5 million or 4.1%, due to a decrease in the number of selling communities from 27 to 25. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Carolinas segment during the six months ended June 30, 2017 increased by 25 units or 6.8%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $10.7 million or 7.9%, primarily as a result of the Savvy acquisition. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Arizona segment during the six months ended June 30, 2017 decreased by 30 units or 11.5%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed decreased by $4.0 million or 4.9%, due to lower volumes at communities that are expected to close out in 2017. The overall decrease in the number of net housing contracts signed reflects the winding down of older communities, while the overall increase in the dollar value of housing contracts signed is due to an increase in the average sales price. The cancellation rate during the six months ended June 30, 2017 decreased to 11.4% from 15.2% compared to the same period in 2016. The cancellation rate in the Florida segment decreased to 9.3% from 15.3% over the same period due to certain closed out communities that had higher cancellation rates in the prior period. The cancellation rate in the Carolinas segment during six months ended June 30, 2017 increased to 11.1% from 8.3% during the six months ended June 30, 2016, attributable to newer communities focused on first-time home buyers who tend to have higher cancellation rates. The cancellation rate in the Arizona segment during the six months ended June 30, 2017 decreased to 18.1% from 23.2% compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to communities closing out in 2017, which had higher first-time home buyer volume in 2016. Backlog for the Florida, Carolinas and Arizona segments as of June30, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): The backlog of housing contracts as of June 30, 2017 compared to June 30, 2016 decreased by 74 units or 6.5%, and the dollar value of backlog decreased by $10.0 million or 2.7% over the same period. The decrease in units was driven by decreased sales due to lower community counts in the Florida segment and communities in the Arizona segment that are expected to close out in 2017. The backlog of housing contracts in the Florida segment as of June 30, 2017 compared to June 30, 2016 decreased by 32 units or 5.4%, and the dollar value decreased by $2.0 million or 1.2% over the same period, driven by the decrease in selling communities from 27 to 25 and the wind-down of additional communities expected to close out in 2017. The backlog of housing contracts in the Carolinas segment as of June 30, 2017 compared to June 30, 2016 increased by 41 units or 15.2% and the dollar value increased by $15.6 million or 15.1% over the same period, primarily as a result of the Savvy acquisition. The backlog of housing contracts in the Arizona segment as of June 30, 2017 compared to June 30, 2016 decreased by 83 units or 29.3%, due mainly to a decrease in net housing contracts signed and the higher number of closings in 2016. The dollar value decreased by $23.6 million or 25.6% over the same period driven by lower sales in communities that are expected to close out in 2017. 25 As of June 30, 2017, our inventory of unsold (speculative) homes, both completed and under construction, was 545 units, as compared to 439 units as of June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2017, approximately 25% of unsold homes were completed compared to approximately 23% as of June 30, 2016. The increase in speculative homes is mainly due to the Savvy acquisition. The following is a breakdown of our land holdings as of June30, 2017 and December 31, 2016: (1) Estimated lots are based on historical densities for our land. New projects may ultimately be developed into more or less than the number of lots stated. In addition to the lots presented in the table above, we also have approximately 1,700 acres of commercial and industrial land and approximately 5,200 acres of unplatted scattered mixed-use land primarily in Florida. We also have 688 platted scattered lots, primarily in Arizona. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, the most significant of which are the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and changes to tax laws or other circumstances that affect the value of our deferred tax assets.Our 2017 effective tax rate approximates our blended statutory tax rate. Our income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 consisted primarily of the reversal of the valuation allowance related to our federal and state deferred tax assets. Certain states enacted changes to tax rates that impacted the value of our deferred tax assets in 2017. The estimated impact of such change was recorded to income tax expense during the period of change. 26 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary business activities are capital intensive in nature. Significant capital resources are required to finance planned residential communities, homebuilding construction in process, community infrastructure, selling expenses, new projects and working capital needs, including funding of debt service requirements, operating deficits and the carrying costs of land. We finance these activities using cash provided by operating activities, capital market financing and our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. For more information regarding our debt, see Note 5, Senior Debt , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Cash Flows As of June30, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $331.2 million compared to $67.8 million as of December31, 2016. As of June30, 2017, total consolidated indebtedness was $634.5 million compared to $280.0 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase in cash and cash equivalents as of June30, 2017 is primarily due to the completion of the issuance of $400.0 million of our 6.625% Notes in May 2017, partially offset by the initial repurchase of $45.5 million in principal of the 8.50% Notes. The $154.5 million remainder of the 8.50% Notes was redeemed effective July 1, 2017 with available cash. Our operating cash flows fluctuate relative to the status of development within existing communities, expenditures for land, new developments and other real estate activities, sales of various homebuilding product lines within those communities and other developments and to fund operating deficits. For the six months ended June30, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $36.1 million. The operating cash outflow was primarily due to the $46.5 million increase in land and other inventories as we further developed and completed our land and lots for delivery commensurate with the increase in our home closings, the $4.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and the $6.6 million increase in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities. These outflows were partially offset by our net income, a $2.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of a portion of our 8.50% Notes, a $1.3 million decrease in receivables, a $5.7 million increase in our customer deposits driven by a 52% increase in backlog since December 31, 2016, and a $2.4 million decrease in our net deferred tax assets. Net cash used in investing activities was $42.3 million mainly due to the acquisition of Savvy. Net cash provided by financing activities was $341.9 million, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of the 6.625% Notes, partially offset by the repurchase of the 8.50% Notes and $8.1 million in debt issuance costs. For the six months ended June30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $7.4 million. The operating cash outflow was primarily due to the net income of $118.2 million offset by the $110.2 million decrease in deferred tax assets, net due to the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in June 2016. The remaining change was due to the increase in land and other inventories of $54.0 million partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $25.9 million related to the release of the interest reserve requirement for our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.3 million primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities was $16.2 million, primarily due to the repayment of the remaining $46.8 million of 7.50% Notes at maturity, partially offset by a draw of $35.0 million on the Senior Secured Credit Facility during the first quarter of 2016. Other Assuming that no significant adverse changes occur in our business, we anticipate the aggregate cash on hand, cash flow generated through homebuilding and related operations, and the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business for the next twelve months. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Surety bonds, issued by third-party entities, are used primarily to guarantee our performance to construct improvements in our various communities. As of June30, 2017, we had outstanding surety bonds of approximately $40.3 million. The amount of outstanding surety bonds could fluctuate depending on the level of development activity. We do not believe that it is likely any of these outstanding surety bonds will be drawn upon. 27 Critical Accounting Policies There were no material changes in AV Homes' critical accounting policies during the six months ended June30, 2017.
