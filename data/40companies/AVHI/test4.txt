AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)    March 31, 2017        Note 1 -  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies        Basis of Presentation        The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AV Homes, Inc. and all subsidiaries, partnerships and other entities in which AV Homes, Inc. ("AV Homes," "we," "us," "our," or "the Company") has a controlling interest. Our investments in unconsolidated entities in which we have less than a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method.The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules andregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for complete financial statements. These statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of AV Homes as of March31, 2017 and for all periods presented. These statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in AV Homes' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2016. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.        Use of Estimates        The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.        Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash        We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of March31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were primarily in money market accounts that invest primarily in U.S. government securities.Due to the short maturity period of the cash equivalents, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximates their fair values.        Our cash items that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage include deposits of $1.5 million and $1.2 million as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016, respectively.        Receivables        Receivables primarily consist of amounts in transit or due from title companies for house closings and for rebates.        Land and Other Inventories and Homebuilding Cost of Revenues        Land and other inventories include expenditures for land acquisition, land development, home construction, construction costs for amenities, and direct and allocated indirect costs, including interest cost capitalized until development and construction are substantially completed. These costs are assigned to components of land and other inventories based on specific identification, relative sales value, or area allocation methods.        Land and other inventories are stated at cost unless the asset is determined to be impaired, in which case the asset is written to its fair value, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 360, Property, Plant and Equipment ("ASC 360").        Homebuilding cost of revenues is comprised of direct and allocated costs, including estimated future costs for the limited warranty we provide on our homes. Land acquisition, land development and other common costs are generally allocated on a relative sales value or area allocation basis to the homes or lots within the applicable community or land parcel. Land acquisition and land development costs include related interest and real estate taxes during the period of time under development.             4             We evaluate our land and other inventories for impairment on a quarterly basis in accordance with ASC 360 to reflect market conditions, including a consideration of supply of new and resale homes for sale in the respective market, level of foreclosure activity and competition. For assets held and used, if indicators are present, we perform an impairment test by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If such cash flows are less than the asset's carrying value, the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value. Generally, fair value is determined by discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the asset and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in the determination of fair value would vary, depending on the state of development. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of the estimated future cash flows are based on several factors, including expectations of future operations and economic conditions. Changes to these assumptions could significantly affect the estimates of future cash flows, which could affect the potential for future impairments. Due to the uncertainties of the estimation process, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates.        During the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, our impairment assessments resulted in $0.1 million and $0.2 million of impairment charges, respectively, and are included in homebuilding cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.        Property and Equipment, net        Property and equipment, net are stated at cost and depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets: land improvements 5 to 15 years; buildings and improvements 3 to 40years; and machinery, equipment and fixtures 2 to 10 years.Maintenance and operating expenses of equipment utilized in the development of land are capitalized to land inventory. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.        Property and equipment includes amenities assets such as club facilities on properties owned by us. The cost of amenities assets includes expenditures for land acquisition, construction, land development and direct and allocated costs. Property and equipment owned and constructed by us also includes interest cost incurred during development and construction.        Each reporting period, we review our property and equipment for indicators of impairment in accordance with ASC 360. For our amenities, which are located within our housing communities, indicators of impairment are similar to those of our housing communities (described above), as these factors may impact our ability to generate revenues at our amenities or cause construction costs to increase. In addition, we factor in the collectability and potential delinquency of the fees due for our amenity memberships. Forthe three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, we did not identify indicators of impairment for our property and equipment.        Investments in Partnerships and Limited Liability Companies        When we are either deemed to hold the controlling interest in a voting interest entity or deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE"), we are required to consolidate the investment.        Factors considered when determining if we hold the controlling interest in a voting interest entity include who holds the general partnership or managing member interests, which partner or member makes the day-to-day decisions regarding the operations of the entity, and whether or not the other partners or members have substantive participating rights.        With respect to VIEs, our variable interests may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets and/or (3) loans provided by us to the investor. We examine specific criteria and use judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb the majority of losses of the VIE or the right to receive the majority of benefits from the VIE.        Investments, including joint ventures with independent third parties, where we do not hold the controlling interest and we are not the primary beneficiary, but over which we have significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses of these entities.        We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint  Ventures . If we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Any such losses are recorded to interest income and other in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant     5         volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. During the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, we did not identify indicators of impairment for our investments in unconsolidated entities.        Business Acquisitions        When acquiring a business, we allocate the purchase price of the business to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values. In making estimates of fair values for this purpose, we use a number of sources, including independent appraisals and information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence and its marketing and housing activities.        Goodwill        Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net fair value amounts that were assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. There were no indicators of impairment during the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016.        Revenue Recognition        In accordance with ASC 360, homebuilding revenue and related profit from the sales of housing units are recognized when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In addition, revenues from land sales are recognized in full at closing, provided the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate, any financing is considered collectible and there is no significant continuing involvement.        Sales Incentives        When sales incentives involve a discount on the selling price of the home, we record the discount as a reduction of revenue at the time of house closing. If the sales incentive requires us to provide a free product or service to the customer, the cost of the free product or service is recorded as homebuilding cost of revenues at the time of house closing. This includes the cost related to optional upgrades and seller-paid financing costs, closing costs, homeowners' association fees, or merchandise.        Advertising Costs        Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, advertising costs totaled $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Advertising costs, sales commissions and closing costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.        Warranty Costs        Warranty reserves for houses are established to cover estimated costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims to be incurred subsequent to the closing of a house. Reserves are determined based on historical data and other relevant factors. We have, and require our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, workers' compensation, and other business insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy limits. We may have recourse against subcontractors for certain claims relating to workmanship and materials. Warranty reserves are included in accrued and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.             6             During the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016, changes in the warranty reserve consisted of the following (in thousands):             Income Taxes        Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, the most significant of which are the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and changes to tax laws or other circumstances that affect the value of our deferred tax assets. As a result, our effective tax rate in 2016 was not correlated to the amount of our income before income taxes. Our income tax expense for the first quarter of 2017 reflects a more normalized effective tax rate while there was a minimal tax provision for the first quarter of 2016 due to the continuation of our full valuation allowance.        We evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is "more likely than not" that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods. We conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence. This evaluation considers, among other factors, historical operating results, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and the outlooks for the U.S. housing industry and broader economy. Based on our evaluation through March 31, 2016, we had fully reserved our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization. As of June 30, 2016, we determined that the valuation allowance against all of our federal and state deferred tax assets was no longer required. Accordingly, we reversed $112.9 million of valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2016 and the remaining $11.0 million over the third and fourth quarters of 2016.        The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between estimated and actual results could result in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Certain states enacted changes to tax laws that impacted the value of our deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2017. The estimated impact of such change was recorded to income tax expense during the period.        Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes. As of March 31, 2017, we had no unrecognized tax benefits.        Any interest or penalties assessed have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results. In the event we are assessed any interest or penalties in the future, we plan to include them in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as income tax expense.        Share-Based Compensation        The Amended and Restated 1997 Incentive and Capital Accumulation Plan (2011 Restatement), as amended ("Incentive Plan"), and the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2015 Plan") provide for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, performance awards, and stock units to officers, employees and directors of AV Homes. The exercise prices of stock options granted under the Incentive Plan and the 2015 Plan may not be less than the stock exchange closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock option awards under the Incentive Plan and 2015 Plan generally expire 10 years after the date of grant.        As of March 31, 2017, there were an aggregate of 439,179 shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan and 322,742 shares reserved for future issuance relating to stock options, performance share units, and restricted stock units previously awarded and currently outstanding under the 2015 Plan. Additionally, as of March 31, 2017, an aggregate of 490,483 shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance in connection with options and restricted stock units previously awarded under the Incentive Plan.             7             Earnings Per Share        Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of AV Homes. The computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 did not assume the effect of employee stock options or 6.00% Notes (defined below) because the effects were antidilutive.        The following table represents a reconciliation of the net income and weighted average shares outstanding for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except per share amounts):             Comprehensive Income        Net income and comprehensive income are the same for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 because we do not have components of comprehensive income.        Recent Accounting Pronouncements        In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment ("ASU 2017-04"), which removes the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted, and applied prospectively. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2017 and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.        In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 reduces the existing diversity in practice in financial reporting across all industries by clarifying certain existing principles in ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows , including providing additional guidance on how and what an entity should consider in determining the classification of certain cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for us for the fiscal year and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 will modify our current disclosures within the consolidated statements of cash flows but is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.        In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. ASU 2016-09 is effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods beginning January 1, 2017. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements and forfeitures will be applied on a modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect     8         adjustment to equity as of January 1, 2017. We have applied the provisions of ASU 2016-09 and there was no material effect on our consolidated financial statements.        In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 will require organizations that lease assets - referred to as "lessees" - to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Under ASU 2016-02, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current GAAP. In addition, disclosures of leasing activities are to be expanded to include qualitative along with specific quantitative information. ASU 2016-02 is effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019. The standard mandates a modified retrospective transition method. We continue to evaluate the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.        In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. The FASB has also issued a number of updates to this standard. The standard is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018. We expect to apply the modified retrospective method of adoption. We continue to evaluate the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.        Note 2 - Land and Other Inventories        As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, land and other inventories consisted of the following (in thousands):             We capitalize interest to inventories during the period of development in accordance with ASC 835, Interest ("ASC 835"). Homebuilding interest capitalized to cost of inventory is included in cost of sales as related units or lots are closed. To the extent our homebuilding debt exceeds our qualified assets, as defined in ASC 835, we expense a portion of interest incurred. Qualified homebuilding assets consist of land, lots and homes that are under development or construction, excluding finished unsold homes or finished models.        The following table represents interest incurred, interest capitalized, and interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):                 Note 3 - Investments in Unconsolidated Entities        We participate in entities with equity interests ranging from 20% to 58% for the purpose of acquiring and/or developing land. We determine the method for accounting for our investment at inception or upon a reconsideration event.        We share in the profits and losses of unconsolidated entities generally in accordance with our ownership interests. We and our equity partners typically make initial and ongoing capital contributions to these unconsolidated entities on a pro rata basis. The obligation to make capital contributions is governed by each unconsolidated entity's respective operating agreement or other governing documents. We made contributions totaling less than $0.1 million to our unconsolidated entities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and made no contributions during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The balance of our investments in unconsolidated entities was $1.2 million as of March 31, 2017 and December31, 2016.        In May 2012, we entered into an agreement with JEN Arizona 4, LLC to form a limited liability company, EM646, LLC ("EM 646"). We hold a 58.2% interest in the venture, which was organized for the purpose of acquiring, entitling,     9         developing, and distributing specific sections of real property located in Mesa, Arizona. The property was originally acquired in November 2012 and in April 2015 the final distribution of developed land to the partners was completed at cost.        As of March 31, 2017, EM 646 was financed by partner equity and does not have third-party debt. In addition, we have not provided any guarantees to the entity or our equity partner. The assets of our investee can only be used to settle obligations of the investee.        Note 4   Senior Debt        As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, senior debt, net consisted of the following (in thousands):             8.50% Senior Notes due 2019        On June 30, 2014, we completed an underwritten offering for $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "8.50% Notes"). The 8.50% Notes mature on July 1, 2019, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest on the 8.50% Notes is 8.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2015. The 8.50% Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after July 1, 2016, at certain redemption prices, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.        Certain of our subsidiaries are guarantors of the 8.50% Senior Notes. All of the subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned by us, and all of the guarantees are full, unconditional, and joint and several. We have no independent assets or operations and our subsidiaries, other than the subsidiary guarantors, are minor.        6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020        On June23, 2015, we completed a private offering of $80.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 (the "6.00% Notes"). The proceeds of the 6.00% Notes were used to (i) repurchase 7.50% Senior Exchange Convertible Notes due 2016 and 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2016, and (ii) pay approximately $1.5 million of accrued interest (in respect of the notes being exchanged or repurchased) and premium (in respect of the notes being repurchased). The 6.00% Notes will mature on July1, 2020, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The 6.00% Notes are governed by the Indenture dated February4, 2011 and the Third Supplemental Indenture dated June 23, 2015 between us and the trustee named therein. The 6.00% Notes bear regular cash interest on the principal amount of each note, payable semi-annually in arrears on January1 and July1 of each year, beginning on January1, 2016.        The 6.00% Notes were issued pursuant a series of separate, privately negotiated note purchase agreements (the "Note Purchase Agreements") entered into on June17, 2015 by us and certain qualified institutional buyers. TPG Aviator, L.P. ("TPG") purchased $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.00% Notes for $20.0million in cash and waived its rights to purchase additional 6.00% Notes, resulting in a fully diluted beneficial ownership for TPG of approximately 43.8% of our common stock at the time of the transaction. Pursuant to the terms of our Related Person Transaction Policy, the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved the terms of the 6.00% Notes and TPG's purchase of 6.00% Notes.        Senior Secured Credit Facility        On April 7, 2014 we entered into a $65.0 million senior secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, a lender and a letter of credit issuer (the "Senior Secured Credit Facility"). The other original lenders and letter of credit issuers include Royal Bank of Canada and Credit Suisse AG. Later in 2014, we increased the Senior Secured Credit Facility by $40.0 million with the addition of Citibank, N.A., and Deutsche Bank, A.G., as additional lenders. The Senior Secured Credit Facility included revolving credit and letter of credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $105.0 million, with an     10         "accordion" feature that allowed us, with the consent of the lenders, to increase the aggregate amount to $175.0 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also included a swing line loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $30.0million.        On July 28, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facility and existing Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (the "Amendment"), which included the addition of Flagstar Bank, FSB and U.S. Bank, National Association as additional lenders, and on October 26, 2016, we received a commitment from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., increasing the amount committed under the Senior Secured Credit Facility by $25 million. Pursuant to the Amendment, and after giving effect to the commitment from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., the committed amount for revolving credit available under the Senior Secured Credit Facility was increased to $190.0 million. On June 6, 2017, Deutsche Bank, A.G.'s commitment will expire and the total committed amount available under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will be reduced by $15.0 million. The remaining commitments will expire on July 28, 2019 and any loans outstanding on such date will mature and be payable. In connection with the Amendment, the "accordion" feature was increased from $175.0 million to $200.0 million, the committed amount available under the letter of credit facilities was reduced to 50% of the total commitments in respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, and the $30.0 million swing line loan facility was discontinued. As of March 31, 2017, we had sufficient qualified assets in the borrowing base to cover borrowings of up to $177.0 million and had no borrowings outstanding.        We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Senior Secured Facility as of March 31, 2017 and December31, 2016.        Note 5 - Estimated Development Liability        The estimated development liability consists primarily of utility completion obligations in Rio Rico, Arizona and Poinciana, Florida for more than 8,000 home sites previously sold, in most cases prior to 1980. The estimated development liability is reduced by actual expenditures and is evaluated and adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect management's estimate of potential costs. In addition, we obtainthird-party engineer evaluations on an annual basis and adjust this liability to reflect changes in the estimated completion costs. Cash expenditures associated with these obligations were $0.1million and $0.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Future increases or decreases of costs for construction, material and labor, as well as other land development and utilities infrastructure costs, may have a significant effect on the estimated development liability. The balance of the estimated development liability was $32.0million and $32.1million as of March 31, 2017 and December31, 2016, respectively.        Note 6 - Commitments and Contingencies        Legal        We are involved in litigation from time to time, primarily arising in the normal course of our business. These cases are in various procedural stages. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these legal and regulatory matters, we generally cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the pending matters, the related timing, or the eventual loss. While the outcome of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.        Surety Bonds        Surety bonds, issued by third-party entities, are used primarily to guarantee our performance to construct improvements in our various communities. As of March 31, 2017, we had outstanding surety bonds of approximately $41.6 million. The amount of outstanding surety bonds could fluctuate depending on the level of development activity. We do not believe that it is likely any of these outstanding surety bonds will be drawn upon.             11             Note 7 - Segment Information        Our operating segments are defined as a component of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make operating decisions. We have identified our chief operating decision maker as our Chief Executive Officer. Our reportable segments are as follows: Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona.        The following table summarizes our information for reportable segments for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (inthousands):                          12             Note 8 - Fair Value Disclosures        ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"), provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, expands disclosures about fair value measurements, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.        The accounting standards require that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:        Level 1: Fair value determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.        Level 2: Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, by correlation or other means.        Level 3: Fair value determined using significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flows, or similar techniques.        The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, and accounts payable and the  Senior Secured Credit Facility approximates the fair value due to their short-term nature.        Certain assets are required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.        The carrying amounts and fair values of our financial liabilities as of March 31, 2017 and December31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):              (1)     The carrying amount of the debt instruments are net of unamortized deferred financing costs and certain debt discounts.    (2)     In April 2017, we made the final earn-out payment due in connection with the Bonterra Builders acquisition in the amount of $2.4 million.       In estimating the fair value of financial liabilities, we used the following methods and assumptions:        Senior Notes        As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the fair value of the 8.50% Notes and the 6.00% Notes is estimated, based on quoted or estimated market prices. These fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.        Contingent Consideration ("earn-out")        This was first recognized as part of the purchase price paid for the Bonterra Builders acquisitions in 2015and falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. At inception, the fair values were determined through the use of valuation models which simulated earnings, applying the terms of the earn-out in each simulated path, determining the average payment in each year across all the trials of the simulation, and calculating the sum of the present values of the payments in each year. The primary inputs and key assumptions include estimated future earnings, probabilities of achievement, earnings volatility, and the discount rate.             13             Note 9   Subsequent Event        On April 3, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Savvy Homes, LLC and certain of its affiliated entities ("Savvy") forapproximately $45 million, including a $3 million estimated earn-out, and remains subject to customary post-closingadjustments. The actual amount of the earn-out may be more or less than the $3 million target amount based on theperformance of the Savvybusiness through the end of 2018. A portion of the aggregate consideration equal to $0.6 millionwas placed in a third-party escrowaccount as security for Savvy's indemnification and other obligations under the purchaseagreement. Savvy acquires raw and developed land, develops raw land and constructs single-family homes in the Raleigh,North Carolina area and enhances ourposition in a key growth market.        As of the date of this report, the initial accounting for this business combination is incomplete because the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired is still in process; therefore, certain disclosures required by ASC 805, Business Combinations , cannot be made at this time. These disclosures include the amount of acquisition-related costs, the fair value of acquired receivables, the amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities acquired, the amount of goodwill recognized, if any, including qualitative discussion of the factors that make up that goodwill, the total amount of goodwill deductible for tax purposes, the amount of goodwill reportable by segment, the fair value and description of contingent consideration, and the amount of revenue and earnings of Savvy since the date of acquisition and since the beginning of 2016.            14             
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
       Executive Overview        We are engaged in the business of homebuilding and community development in Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona. We also engage to a limited degree in other real estate activities, such as the operation of amenities and the sale of land for third-party development. We manage our business through three reportable segments: Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona.        For three months ended March31, 2017, we derived 49% of our revenues from Florida, 31% of our revenues from the Carolinas and 20% of our revenues from Arizona.        Our primary business is the development of land and the construction and sale of homes for people of all ages, including active adults (55 years and older). Our current homebuilding sales activities include locations in Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona, with additional communities in the pipeline for each region. Within each geographical segment, we build both active adult communities, which are restricted to homeowners that are age 55 and older, and primary residential communities, which are open to all ages. This geographic and product segment diversification helps mitigate our overall business risks. We also opportunistically sell existing non-core commercial and industrial land positions, as well as scattered lot positions and land assets, that are in excess of our needed supply in a given market.        As of March31, 2017, our selling community count included 55 locations: 24 in Florida, 22 in the Carolinas, and nine in Arizona, with additional communities in the pipeline for each region. Our count of communities with closings included 57 locations:26 in Florida, 22 in the Carolinas, and nine in Arizona.        Solivita and Vitalia in Central Florida; CantaMia and Encore in Arizona; and Creekside at Bethpage in Raleigh, North Carolina currently serve as our flagship communities in the active adult market. These communities broaden our geographic footprint and product offering, and should provide us with market participation in the long-term growth of demand from the wave of Baby Boomers entering their retirement years.        We continue to invest in the primary residential market to create a more diversified portfolio that mitigates cyclical impact over time. Through homebuilder acquisitions and purchases of new land and lot positions, we have expanded and continue to expand within our existing markets in Central Florida, Charlotte, Raleigh, Jacksonville and the greater Phoenix area. Replacement lot positions require new acquisitions of developed lots or platted or unplatted undeveloped land, or we may decide to develop current land holdings, depending on market conditions within the submarket of these assets.        Our business is significantly influenced by a number of factors that affect our revenues and costs, including market demand for new homes, labor supply and wages, materials prices, land availability and mortgage rates. In managing our business and the influence of these factors, we track several key operating metrics described below.        Key Operating Metrics        Contracts signed . Net contracts signed for a given period represents the number of contracts we have entered into with home buyers for the purchase and sale of homes, less the number of contracts that were cancelled in the same period. We consider a home sales contract cancelled when the customer terminates the contract or when we provide notice of termination due to a failure on the part of the customer to close on the home or meet a contingency under the contract.        Home starts . Home starts is the number of new homes on which we have started construction in a given period. Home starts are monitored by management in order to minimize the time between contract signing and home closing.        Closings . Closings represents the number of home sales closed in the period. We recognize revenue equal to the sales price of a home when the sales are closed and title passes to the purchasers.        Backlog . Backlog is the number of homes we are building that are under contract for sale that have not closed as of the end of the period being presented. The dollar value of backlog is the revenue anticipated to be realized at closing equal to the purchase price provided in the applicable contract. Backlog is an important indicator of home closings and homebuilding revenues in future periods.             15             Average sales price . Average sales price represents total revenue for a given period divided by the number of closings for such period.        Seasonality        Our business is affected to some extent by the seasonality of home sales, which generally produce increased closings in the latter half of the year. However, periods of economic downturn in the industry can alter seasonal patterns.        Results of Operations        The following table provides a comparison of certain financial data related to our operations for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):                  16             Data from closings for the Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona segments for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):                 First Quarter 2017 Highlights        During the first quarter of 2017, we continued to execute our strategic and operational business plan through (i) the continued deployment of existing capital into land and lot acquisitions, (ii) the development of existing land and lot positions, in addition to the construction of homes for sale, (iii) the increase in the number of homes closed, and (iv) the sale of non-core land positions.        Three Months Ended March31, 2017 and 2016        Consolidated Results        Overall revenue increased by $31.5 million or 25.4% to $155.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. Homebuilding revenueincreased by $27.4 million or 22.6% compared to the same period in 2016 driven by a 7.9% increase in units closed and a13.8% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. Amenity and other revenue and land sales increased $4.0 million in total compared to the same period in 2016 driven mainly by the $2.2 million increase in land sales.Additionally, the gain on land sales during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $1.3 million compared to $0.1 million during the same period in 2016. Land sales can be highly variable from quarter-to-quarter and large fluctuations may occur.        Homebuilding Operations        Homebuilding revenue, which is revenue from home closings, increased $27.4 million or 22.6% to $148.7million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a 7.9%increase in units closed and a 13.8% increase in the average sales price for homes closed. In the Florida segment, homebuilding revenue increased $4.4 million or 6.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily driven by an8.4% increase in the average sales price for homes closed, partially offset by a small decrease in units closed. In the Carolinas segment, revenues increased by $13.3 million or 39.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a 27.1% increase in units closed driven by increased closings at our active adult community and newer communities which opened in late 2016 and a 10.0% increase in the average selling price of homes closed. In the Arizona segment, revenues increased $9.7 million or 44.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 driven by a 14.8% increase in units closed primarily in our active adult communities and our communities that opened in 2016; and a25.7% increase in the average selling price due to a combination of selective price increases and the mix of communities with closings.        Gross margin, which is homebuilding revenue less homebuilding cost of revenues, from total home closings decreased by 90 basis points to17.4% from 18.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Gross margin from the Florida segment decreased by 80 basis points to 20.6% from 21.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016mainly due to higher land development costs. Gross margin from the Carolinas segment decreased by 60 basis points to 14.3% from 14.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to higher land development costs, partially offset bylower land acquisition costs. Gross margin from the     17         Arizona segment improved by 30 basis points to 14.7% from 14.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 mainly due to lower land cost basis in units closed. Capitalized interest included in cost of sales for the Florida, Carolinas and Arizona segments was $1.9 million, $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and was $1.5 million, $0.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for the same period in 2016.        Total selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue improved to 15.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 16.8% for the same period in 2016. Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenue ("Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratio") improved to 11.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 13.4% for the same period in 2016 as we were able to continue to leverage the cost base over our increased revenues. Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratiofor the Florida segment improved to 13.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 13.9% for the same period in 2016. Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratiofor the Carolinas segment improved to 10.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 12.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 due to leveraging our cost base over increased revenue.Homebuilding SG&A to Revenue Ratiofor the Arizona segment improved to 10.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 14.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily due to the cost leverage achieved from the 44.5% increase in homebuilding revenue and lower sales and marketing costs.        Corporate general and administrative expenses increased by $0.6 million to $4.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. As a percentage of homebuilding revenue, corporate general and administrative expenses improved to 3.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 3.4% for the same period in 2016. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was driven by the increase in revenue, while containing our costs.        Interest expense decreased by $0.4 million to $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in interest expense is due to no outstanding borrowings on the Senior Secured Credit Facility during the first quarter of 2017 compared to $35.0 million outstanding during the same period in 2016.        Income before income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $4.2 million compared to $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the higher volume of closings, increases in average sales price for homes closed, leveraging our cost base and an increase of $1.2 million in land sale gains.        Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1.7 million and $0.1 million,respectively.        Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $2.4 million or $0.11 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to the higher volume of closings, increases in average selling price and leveraging our cost base.        Data from contracts signed for the Florida, Carolinas and Arizona segments for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):                 The total number of net housing contracts signed during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016decreased by 18units or 2.6%. The dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $4.8 million or 2.3% over     18         the same period. The decrease in units was driven by the Florida and Arizona segments, partially offset by an increase in the Carolinas. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Florida segment during the three months ended March 31, 2017decreased by 17 units or 4.5%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed decreased by $0.6 million or 0.6%, due to a decrease in the number of selling communities from 26 to 24. The number of net housing contracts signed for the Carolinas segment during the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by 11units or 6.3%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $5.4 million or 8.3%, primarily as a result of the timing and launch of newer communities.The number of net housing contracts signed for the Arizona segment during the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased by 12 units or 9.4%, while the dollar value of housing contracts signed increased by $0.1 million or 0.3%, due to communities that are expected to close out in 2017. The overall decreasein the number of net housing contracts signed reflects a decrease in the number of selling communities from 60 to 55,while the overall increase in the dollar value of housing contracts signed is due to an increase in the average sales price.        The cancellation rate during the three months ended March 31, 2017decreased to 11.2% from 14.8% compared to the same period in 2016. The cancellation rate in the Florida segment decreased to 9.7% from 14.4% over the same period due to a higher mix of sales in our active adult communities in 2017 which tend to have lower cancellation rates. The cancellation rate in the Carolinas segment during three months ended March 31, 2017increased to 9.8% from 7.0% during the three months ended March 31, 2016,attributable to newer communities focused on first-time home buyers who tend to have higher cancellation rates. The cancellation rate in the Arizona segment during the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased to 17.7% from 24.3% compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to communities closing out in 2017 which had higher first-time home buyer volume in 2016.        Backlog for the Florida, Carolinas and Arizona segments as of March31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):             The backlog of housing contracts as of March 31, 2017 compared to March 31, 2016decreased by 148units or 14.1%, and the dollar value of backlog decreased by $29.7 million or 8.9% over the same period. The decrease in units was driven by decreased sales due to lower community counts in the Florida and Carolinas segments. The backlog of housing contracts in the Florida segment as of March 31, 2017 compared to March 31, 2016decreased by 87 units or 16.0%, and the dollar value decreased by $20.6 million or 13.2% over the same period, driven by the decrease in selling communities from 26 to 24 and the wind-down of additional communities expected to close out in 2017. The backlog of housing contracts in the Carolinas segment as of March 31, 2017 compared to March 31, 2016 increased by 27units or 11.8% and the dollar value increased by $15.6 million or 17.7% over the same period, primarily as a result of the timing and launch of newer communities in 2016. The backlog of housing contracts in the Arizona segment as of March 31, 2017 compared to March 31, 2016 decreased by 88 units or 31.4%, due mainly to a decrease in net housing contracts signed and the higher number of closings in 2016. The dollar value decreased by $24.6 million or 27.3% over the same period driven by slower sales in communities that are expected to close out in 2017.        As of March 31, 2017, our inventory of unsold (speculative) homes, both completed and under construction, was 368 units, as compared to 341 units as of March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, approximately 30% of unsold homes were completed compared to approximately 36% as of March 31, 2016. The increase in speculative homes is mainly due to the timing and launch of newer communities in the Carolinas segment.             19             The following is a breakdown of our land holdings as of March31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:             (1)  Estimated lots are based on historical densities for our land. New projects may ultimately be developed into more or less than the number of lots stated.        In addition to the lots presented in the table above, we also have approximately 1,700 acres of commercial and industrial land and approximately 5,200 acres of unplatted scattered mixed-use land primarily in Florida. We also have 689 platted scattered lots, primarily in Arizona.        Income Taxes        Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, the most significant of which are the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and changes to tax laws or other circumstances that affect the value of our deferred tax assets. As a result, our effective tax rate in 2016 was not correlated to the amount of our income before income taxes. Our income tax expense for the first quarter of 2017 reflects a more normalized effective tax rate while there was a minimal tax provision for the first quarter of 2016 due to the continuation of our full valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2016, we determined that the valuation allowance against all of our federal and state deferred tax assets was no longer required. Accordingly, we reversed $112.9 million of valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2016 and the remaining $11.0 million over the third and fourth quarters of 2016.        Certain states enacted changes to tax laws that impacted the value of our deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2017. The estimated impact of such change was recorded to income tax expense during the period.        Liquidity and Capital Resources        Our primary business activities are capital intensive in nature. Significant capital resources are required to finance planned residential communities, homebuilding construction in process, community infrastructure, selling expenses, new projects and working capital needs, including funding of debt service requirements, operating deficits and the carrying costs of land. We finance these activities using cash provided by operating activities, capital market financing and our senior secured credit facility.For more information regarding our debt, see Note 4, Senior Debt , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.        Cash Flows        As of March31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $58.6 million compared to $67.8 million as of December31, 2016. As of March31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, total consolidated indebtedness was $280.0 million. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of March31, 2017 is primarily due to the development of land and the increase in homes completed or under construction.             20             Our operating cash flows fluctuate relative to the status of development within existing communities, expenditures for land, new developments and other real estate activities, sales of various homebuilding product lines within those communities and other developments and to fund operating deficits.        For the three months ended March31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $8.1 million. The operating cash outflow was primarily due to (i) the $14.9 increase in land and other inventoriesas we further developed and completed our land and lots for delivery commensurate with the increase in our home closings; and (ii) the $8.9 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, primarily as a result of our semi-annual interest payment on our senior notes. These outflows were partially offset by our net income, a $4.6 million decrease in receivables, a $3.1 million decrease in customer deposits, and a $1.7 million decrease in our net deferred tax assets.Net cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment for model center furniture and fixtures in our Florida segment. Net cash used in financing activities was $0.4 million primarily due to the payment of withholding taxes on share-based awards.        For the three months ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $19.1 million. The operating cash outflow was primarily due to the increase in land and other inventories of $47.4 million and decrease in accrued liabilities of $7.6 million. Using the proceeds from our 8.50% Notes issued in June 2014 and our 6.00% Notes issued in June 2015, we purchased land and lots, including through the acquisition of the Bonterra Builders business, for the expansion of all our homebuilding segments and increased the number of homes under construction commensurate with the increase in our home sales. These outflows were partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $25.7 million related to the release of the interest reserve requirement for our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.3 million primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities was $11.9 million, primarily due to the repayment of the 7.50% Notes at maturity, partially offset by a draw of $35.0 million on the Senior Secured Credit Facility during the first quarter of 2016.        Other        Assuming that no significant adverse changes occur in our business, we anticipate the aggregate cash on hand, cash flow generated through homebuilding and related operations, and the Senior Secured Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business for the next 12 months.        Off Balance Sheet Arrangements        Performance bonds, issued by third-party entities, are used primarily to guarantee our performance to construct improvements in our various communities. As of March31, 2017, we had outstanding performance bonds of approximately $41.6 million. The amount of outstanding performance bonds could fluctuate depending on the level of development activity. We do not believe that it is likely any of these outstanding performance bonds will be drawn upon.
