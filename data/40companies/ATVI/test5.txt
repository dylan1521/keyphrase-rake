AND SUBSIDIARIES  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  (Unaudited)    1.  Description of Business and Basis of Consolidation and Presentation    Activision Blizzard,Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services across all of the major gaming platforms, including video game consoles, personal computers ( PC ), and mobile devices. The terms  Activision Blizzard,  the  Company,   we,   us,  and  our  are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard,Inc. and its subsidiaries.    The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December1992. We are the result of the 2008 business combination (the  Business Combination ) by and among the Company (then known as Activision,Inc.), VivendiS.A. ( Vivendi ), and Vivendi Games,Inc. ( Vivendi Games ), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi. In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, Activision,Inc. was renamed Activision Blizzard,Inc.    The common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol  ATVI.     The King Acquisition    On February23, 2016 (the  King Closing Date ), we acquired King Digital Entertainment, a leading interactive mobile entertainment company ( King ), by purchasing all of its outstanding shares (the  King Acquisition ), as further described in Note14. Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the operations of King commencing on the King Closing Date.    Our Segments    As part of the continued implementation of our esports strategy, we instituted changes to our internal organization and reporting structure such that the Major League Gaming ( MLG ) business now operates as a division of Blizzard Entertainment,Inc. ( Blizzard ). As such, commencing with the second quarter of 2017, MLG, which was previously a separate operating segment, is now a component of the Blizzard operating segment. MLG will be responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League TM , along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for Activision Blizzard esports content.    Based upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments as follows:    (i)Activision Publishing,Inc.    Activision Publishing,Inc. ( Activision ) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly in console gaming. Activision primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including full-game sales and in-game purchases, as well as licenses of software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products which are principally based on our internally-developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties. We have also established a long-term alliance with Bungie to publish its game universe, Destiny.    Activision s key product franchises include: Call of Duty  , a first-person shooter for the console and PC platforms; Destiny, an online universe of first-person action gameplay (which we call a  shared-world shooter ) currently for console platforms; and Skylanders  , a franchise geared towards children that brings physical toys to life digitally in the game, primarily for console platforms.    9           (ii)Blizzard Entertainment,Inc.    Blizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly in PC gaming. Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including subscriptions, full-game sales, and in-game purchases, as well as licenses of software to third-party or related party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content, online social connectivity across all Blizzard games, and the creation of user-generated content for Blizzard s games. Commencing with the second quarter of 2017, Blizzard also includes the activities of our MLG business, which is devoted to esports.    Blizzard s key product franchises include: World of Warcraft  , a subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing game for the PC; StarCraft  , a real-time strategy PC franchise; Diablo  , an action role-playing franchise for the PC and console platforms; Hearthstone  , an online collectible card franchise for the PC and mobile platforms; Heroes of the Storm  , a free-to-play team brawler for the PC; and Overwatch  , a team-based first-person shooter for the PC and console platforms.    (iii)King Digital Entertainment    King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS. King also distributes its content and services on online social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King s games are free-to-play, however, players can acquire in-game virtual items, either with virtual currency the players purchase or directly using real currency.    King s key product franchises, all of which are for the PC and mobile platforms, include: Candy Crush , which features  match three  games; Farm Heroes , which also features  match three  games; Pet Rescue , which is a  clicker  game; and Bubble Witch , which features  bubble shooter  games.    Other    We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:       the Activision Blizzard Studios ( Studios ) business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of globally recognized intellectual properties, and which, in October 2016, released the first season of the animated TV series Skylanders   Academy on Netflix; and       the Activision Blizzard Distribution ( Distribution ) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.    Basis of Consolidation and Presentation    The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rulesand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim reporting. Accordingly, certain notes or other information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted if they substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in our annual audited consolidated financial statements. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2016.    10           The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for the fair statement of our financial position and results of operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.    The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current period presentation.    The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued, to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosures.    Supplemental Cash Flow Information: Non-cash Investing and Financing activities    For the six months ended June30, 2016, we had non-cash purchase price consideration of $89 million related to vested and unvested stock options and awards that were assumed and replaced with Activision Blizzard equity or deferred cash awards in the King Acquisition. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion.    2.  Inventories, Net    Our inventories, net consist of the following (amounts in millions):       At June30, 2017, and December31, 2016, inventory reserves were $32 million and $45 million, respectively.    3.  Software Development and Intellectual Property Licenses    The following table summarizes the components of our capitalized software development costs (amounts in millions):       As of June30, 2017, and December31, 2016, intellectual property licenses were not material to our condensed consolidated balance sheets.    Amortization of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses was as follows (amounts in millions):       11           4.  Intangible Assets, Net    Intangible assets, net consist of the following (amounts in millions):          Amortization expense of intangible assets was $194 million and $385 million for the three and six months ended June30, 2017, respectively. Amortization expense of intangible assets was $203 million and $285 million for the three and six months ended June30, 2016, respectively.    At June30, 2017, future amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is estimated as follows (amounts in millions):       12           5.  Goodwill    The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the six months ended June30, 2017, are as follows (amounts in millions):       (1)  As a result of the change in our operating segments discussed in Note 1, goodwill of $12 million previously reported within the Other segments is now included in the Blizzard reportable segment. The prior period balance has been revised to reflect this change.    6.  Fair Value Measurements    Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) literature regarding fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of  observable inputs  and minimize the use of  unobservable inputs.  The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:       Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;       Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and       Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.    13           Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis    The table below segregates all of our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value at the measurement date (amounts in millions):          ARS represented the only level3 investment held by the Company as of December31, 2016. During the six months ended June30, 2017 we sold our ARS investment. The realized gain on the sale of this investment was not material.    Foreign Currency Forward Contracts    Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges    At June30, 2017 and December31, 2016, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges.    Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Hedges ( Cash Flow Hedges )    At June30, 2017, the gross notional amount of outstanding Cash Flow Hedges was approximately $356 million. The fair value of these contracts, all of which have remaining maturities of 12 months or less, was $9 million of net unrealized losses. At June30, 2017, we had approximately $1 million of net realized but unrecognized gains recorded within  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  associated with contracts that had settled but were deferred and will be amortized into earnings, along with the associated hedged revenues. Such amounts will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.    14           At December31, 2016, the gross notional amount of outstanding Cash Flow Hedges was approximately $346 million. The fair value of these contracts was $22 million of net unrealized gains as of December31, 2016.    During the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, there was no ineffectiveness relating to our Cash Flow Hedges. The amount of pre-tax net realized gains associated with these contracts that were reclassified out of  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  and into earnings was not material.    Fair Value Measurements on a Non-Recurring Basis    We measure the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis, generally annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.    For the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, there were no impairment charges related to assets that are measured on a non-recurring basis.    7.  Debt    Credit Facilities    At December31, 2016, we had outstanding term loans  A  of approximately $2.7 billion (the  2016 TLA ) and $250 million available under a revolving credit facility (the  Revolver ) pursuant to a credit agreement executed on October11, 2013 (as amended thereafter and from time to time, the  Credit Agreement ).    On February3, 2017, we entered into a sixth amendment (the  Sixth Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement. The Sixth Amendment: (i)provided for a new tranche of term loans  A  in an aggregate principal amount of $2.55 billion (the  2017 TLA  and, together with the Revolver, the  Credit Facilities ) and (ii)released each of our subsidiary guarantors from their respective guarantees provided under the Credit Agreement. All proceeds of the 2017 TLA, together with additional cash on hand of $139 million, were used to fully retire the 2016 TLA, including all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The terms of the 2017 TLA, other than the absence of the subsidiary guarantees, are generally the same as the terms of the 2016 TLA. The fees incurred as a result of the Sixth Amendment were not material. At June30, 2017, the 2017 TLA bore interest at 2.48%. The 2017 TLA will mature on August23, 2021. We were in compliance with the terms of the Credit Facilities as of June30, 2017. To date, we have not drawn on the Revolver.    During the six months ended June30, 2017, we reduced our total outstanding term loan balances by $1.7 billion. This included $139 million of cash used to retire the 2016 TLA, as discussed above, along with prepayments on the 2017 TLA of $361 million made on February15, 2017 and $1.2 billion made on May26, 2017. The Mayprepayment was made using proceeds from a concurrent issuance of $1.2 billion in notes, as discussed further below. As part of that refinancing, we wrote-off unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $12 million, which is included in  Interest and other expense (income), net  in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.    The prepayments made on our 2017 TLA have satisfied the remaining required quarterly principal repayments for the entire term of the Credit Agreement.    Refer to Note 11 contained in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2016 for further details regarding our Credit Agreement, key terms, and amendments made to our Credit Agreement.    15           Unsecured Senior Notes    At December31, 2016, we had the following unsecured senior notes outstanding:       $750 million of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2023 that we issued on September 19, 2013 (the  2023 Notes ), in a private offering made in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ); and       $650 million of 2.3% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the  Unregistered 2021 Notes ) and $850 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due September 2026 (the  Unregistered 2026 Notes ) that we issued on September 19, 2016, in a private offering made in accordance with Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act.    In connection with the issuance of the Unregistered 2021 Notes and the Unregistered 2026 Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the  Registration Rights Agreement ), among the Company, and the representatives of the initial purchasers of the Unregistered 2021 Notes and the Unregistered 2026 Notes. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, we were required to use commercially reasonable efforts to, within one year of the issue date of the Unregistered 2021 Notes and the Unregistered 2026 Notes, among other things, (1)file a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange each series of the Unregistered 2021 Notes and the Unregistered 2026 Notes for new notes that were substantially identical in all material respects (except for the provisions relating to the transfer restrictions and payment of additional interest) (the  Exchange Offer ), and (2)cause that registration statement (the  Exchange Offer Registration Statement ) to be declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act. The Exchange Offer Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on April28, 2017 and we completed the Exchange Offer on June1, 2017, such that all the Unregistered 2021 Notes and Unregistered 2026 Notes were exchanged for registered 2021 notes (the  2021 Notes ) and registered 2026 notes (the  2026 Notes ).    In addition, on May26, 2017, in a public underwritten offering, we issued $400 million of 2.6% unsecured senior notes due June2022 (the  2022 Notes ), $400 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due June2027 (the  2027 Notes ), and $400 million of 4.5% unsecured senior notes due June2047 (the  2047 Notes , and together with the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes, and the 2027 Notes, the  Notes ), which were outstanding at June30, 2017.    We may redeem some or all of the 2022 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the 2047 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after May15, 2022, March15, 2027 and December15, 2046, respectively, and in each case at 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of the 2022 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2047 Notes prior to May15, 2022, March15, 2027 and December15, 2046, respectively, and in each case at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a  make-whole  premium and accrued and unpaid interest.    Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase the 2022 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2047 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. These repurchase requirements are considered clearly and closely related to the 2022 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2047 Notes and were not accounted for separately upon issuance.    The 2022 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2047 Notes contain covenants that place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of secured debt, entry into sale or leaseback transactions, and certain merger or consolidation transactions.    The Notes are general senior obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment to all of the Company s existing and future senior indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities described above. The Notes are not secured and are effectively subordinated to any of the Company s existing and future indebtedness that is secured. The Company was in compliance with the terms of each of the Notes as of June30, 2017.    16           Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March15 and September15 of each year for the 2021 Notes, the 2023 Notes, and 2026 Notes, and payable semi-annually in arrears on June15 and December15 of each year for the 2022 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and 2047 Notes. Accrued interest payable is recorded within  Accrued expenses and other liabilities  in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.As of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016, we had accrued interest payable of $30 million and $25 million, respectively, related to the Notes.    Refer to Note 11 contained in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2016 for further details regarding our key terms under our indentures that govern the 2021 Notes, the 2023 Notes, and the 2026 Notes.    Interest Expense and Financing Costs    Fees and discounts associated with the issuance of our debt instruments are recorded as debt discount, which reduces their respective carrying values, and is amortized over their respective terms. Amortization expense is recorded within  Interest and other expense (income), net  in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.    In connection with the May2017 note issuances, we incurred approximately $20 million of discounts and financing costs that were capitalized and recorded within  Long-term debt, net  in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.    For the three and six months ended June30, 2017, interest expense was $36 million and $71 million, respectively; amortization of the debt discount and deferred financing costs was $2 million and $9 million, respectively; and commitment fees for the Revolver were not material. For the three and six months ended June30, 2016, interest expense was $55 million and $107 million, respectively; amortization of the debt discount and deferred financing costs was $8 million and $13 million, respectively; and commitment fees for the Revolver were not material.    A summary of our debt is as follows (amounts in millions):          17           As of June30, 2017, the scheduled maturities and contractual principal repayments of our debt for each of the five succeeding years are as follows (amounts in millions):       With the exception of the 2023 Notes, using Level 2 inputs (i.e., observable market prices in less-than-active markets), the carrying values of our debt instruments approximated their fair value as of June30, 2017, as the interest rates are similar to current rates at which we can borrow funds over the selected interest periods. At June30, 2017, based on Level 2 inputs, the fair value of the 2023 Notes was $809 million.    At December31, 2016, the carrying value of the 2016 TLA approximated its fair value, based on Level 2 inputs. At December31, 2016, based on Level 2 inputs, the fair values of the 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2026 Notes were $635 million, $818 million, and $808 million, respectively.    8.  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)    The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at June30, 2017 and 2016, were as follows (amounts in millions):          Income taxes were not provided for foreign currency translation items as these are considered indefinite investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.    18           9.  Operating Segments and Geographic Region    Currently, we have three reportable segments. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker ( CODM ). The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of: the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; share-based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting; fees and other expenses (including legal fees, expenses, and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities, and financings; certain restructuring costs; and other non-cash charges. The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly, no disclosure is made with respect thereto.    Our operating segments are also consistent with our internal organization structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments. As discussed in Note1, commencing with the second quarter of 2017, we made changes to our operating segments which reflect the changes in our organization and reporting structure. Our MLG business, which was previously included in the non-reportable  Other segments,  is now presented within the Blizzard reportable operating segment. Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect this change. The change had no impact on consolidated net revenues or operating income.    Information on the reportable segments and reconciliations of total segment net revenues and total segment operating income to consolidated net revenues from external customers and consolidated income before income tax expense for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 are presented below (amounts in millions):       19              (1)  Other segments include other income and expenses from operating segments managed outside the reportable segments, including our Studios and Distribution businesses. Other segments also include unallocated corporate income and expenses.    (2)  Reflects fees and other expenses, such as legal, banking and professional services fees, primarily related to the King Acquisition and associated integration activities, inclusive of related debt financings.    (3)  Reflects restructuring charges incurred, primarily severance costs.    (4)  Reflects a non-cash accounting charge to reclassify certain cumulative translation gains (losses) into earnings due to the substantial liquidation of certain of our foreign entities.    20           Geographic information presented below for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, is based on the location of the paying customer. Net revenues from external customers by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions):       (1)  EMEA consists of the Europe, Middle East, and Africa geographic regions.    The Company s net revenues in the U.S. were 46% and 48% of consolidated net revenues for the three months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company s net revenues in the U.K. were 10% of consolidated net revenues for both the three months ended June30, 2017 and 2016. No other country s net revenues exceeded 10% of consolidated net revenues for the three months ended June30, 2017 or 2016.    The Company s net revenues in the U.S. were 47% of consolidated net revenues for both the six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016. The Company s net revenues in the U.K. were 10% and 11% of consolidated net revenues for the six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No other country s net revenues exceeded 10% of consolidated net revenues for the six months ended June30, 2017 or 2016.    Net revenues by platform were as follows (amounts in millions):       (1)  Net revenues from Mobile and ancillary include revenues from mobile devices, as well as non-platform specific game-related revenues, such as standalone sales of toys and accessories from our Skylanders franchise and other physical merchandise and accessories.    (2)  Net revenues from Other include revenues from our Studios and Distribution businesses, as well as revenues from MLG.    21           Long-lived assets by geographic region at June30, 2017 and December31, 2016, were as follows (amounts in millions):       (1)  The only long-lived assets that we classify by region are our long-term tangible fixed assets, which consist of property, plant, and equipment assets; all other long-term assets are not allocated by location.    10.  Income Taxes    The Company accounts for its provision for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740,Income Taxes, which requires an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to be applied to the interim period, taking into account year-to-date amounts and projected results for the full year.The provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state, and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory U.S. income tax rate due to the effect of state and local income taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including, but not limited to: variations in the estimated and actual level of pre-tax income or loss by jurisdiction; changes in the mix of income by tax jurisdiction (as taxes are levied at relatively lower statutory rates in foreign regions and relatively higher statutory rates in the U.S.); research and development credits; changes in enacted tax laws and regulations, rulings, and interpretations thereof, including with respect to tax credits and state and local income taxes; developments in tax audits and other matters;recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from share-based payments; and certain nondeductible expenses. Changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition, or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of the change.    The income tax expense of $50 million for the three months ended June30, 2017, reflects an effective tax rate of 17%, which is higher than the effective tax rate of 10% for the three months ended June30, 2016.The increase is due to a decrease in excess tax benefits from share-based payments and an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at relatively lower statutory rates.    The income tax expense of $77 million for the six months ended June30, 2017, reflects an effective tax rate of 10%, which is lower than the effective tax rate of 11% for the six months ended June30, 2016.The decrease is due to an increase in excess tax benefits from share-based payments and a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at relatively lower statutory rates, partially offset by an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions.    The effective tax rate of 17% and 10% for the three and six months ended June30, 2017, respectively, is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower statutory rates, the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, and the recognition of federal and California research and development credits, partially offset by an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions.    The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) is currently examining Activision Blizzard s federal tax returns for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax years.During the second quarter of 2015, the Company transitioned the review of its transfer pricing methodology from the advanced pricing agreement review process to the IRS examination team. Their review could result in a different allocation of profits and losses under the Company s transfer pricing agreements. Such allocation could have a positive or negative impact on our provision for uncertain tax positions for the period in which such a determination is reached and the relevant periods thereafter. The Company also has several state level and non-U.S. audits pending.    22           As part of purchase price accounting for the King Acquisition, the Company assumed $74 million of uncertain tax positions, primarily related to the transfer pricing on King tax years occurring prior to the King Acquisition. The Company is currently in negotiations with the relevant jurisdictions and taxing authorities with respect to King s transfer pricing, which could result in a different allocation of profits and losses between the relevant jurisdictions.    Vivendi Games  results for the period from January1, 2008 through July9, 2008 are included in the consolidated federal and certain foreign state and local income tax returns filed by Vivendi or its affiliates, while Vivendi Games  results for the period from July10, 2008 through December31, 2008 are included in the consolidated federal and certain foreign, state and local income tax returns filed by Activision Blizzard. IRS Appeals proceedings concerning Vivendi Games  tax return for the 2008 tax year were concluded during July2016, but that year remains open to examination by other major taxing authorities. The resolution of the 2008 IRS Appeals process did not have a material impact to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.    Certain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation or may be subject to examination or investigation by tax authorities in various jurisdictions, including France. These proceedings may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or provisions for uncertain tax positions. Such proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in the period or periods in which the matters are resolved or in which appropriate tax provisions are taken into account in our financial statements. If we were to receive a materially adverse assessment from a taxing jurisdiction, we would plan to vigorously contest it and consider all of our options, including the pursuit of judicial remedies.    The final resolution of the Company s global tax disputes is uncertain. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of disputes, including the probability determination and estimation of the potential exposure. Based on current information, in the opinion of the Company s management, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, except as noted above.    23           11.  Computation of Basic/Diluted Earnings Per Common Share    The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in millions, except per share data):       Certain of our unvested restricted stock units meet the definition of participating securities as they participate in earnings based on their rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.Therefore, we are required to use the two-class method in our computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share. For both the three and six months ended June30, 2017, on a weighted-average basis, we had outstanding unvested restricted stock units of less than 1 million shares of common stock that are participating in earnings. For both the three and six months ended June30, 2016, on a weighted-average basis, we had outstanding unvested restricted stock units of 3 million shares of common stock that participated in earnings.    The vesting of certain of our employee-related restricted stock units and options are contingent upon the satisfaction of pre-defined performance measures.These shares are included in the weighted-average dilutive common shares only if the performance measures are met as of the end of the reporting period. Approximately 9 million shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for both the three and six months ended June30, 2017 as their respective performance measures had not yet been met. Approximately 10 million shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for both the three and six months ended June30, 2016 as their respective performance measures had not yet been met.    Potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per common share calculation when the inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, options to acquire less than 1 million and 5 million shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the three and six months ended June30, 2017, respectively, and options to acquire 4 million shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for both the three and six months ended June30, 2016, as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.    24           12.  Capital Transactions    Repurchase Program    On February2, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock during the two-year period from February13, 2017 through February12, 2019. As of June30, 2017, we have not repurchased any shares under this program.    Dividends    On February2, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share. On May10, 2017, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $226 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March30, 2017. On May26, 2017, we made related dividend equivalent payments of less than $1 million to certain holders of restricted stock units.    On February2, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per common share. On May11, 2016, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $192 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March30, 2016. On May27, 2016, we made related dividend equivalent payments of $3 million to certain holders of restricted stock units.    13.  Commitments and Contingencies    Legal Proceedings    We are party to routine claims, suits, investigations, audits, and other proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business, including with respect to intellectual property rights, contractual claims, labor and employment matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, unclaimed property matters, compliance matters, and collection matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, such routine claims and lawsuits are not significant and we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.    14.  Acquisitions    King Digital Entertainment    On February23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition, purchasing all of King s outstanding shares. As a result, King became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision Blizzard. King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS, and on online and social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King s results of operations since the King Closing Date are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements.    We made this acquisition because we believe that the addition of King s highly-complementary mobile business positions us as a global leader in interactive entertainment across console, PC, and mobile platforms, as well as positioning us for future growth.    The aggregate purchase price of the King Acquisition was approximately $5.8 billion, which was paid on the King Closing Date and funded primarily with $3.6 billion of existing cash and $2.2 billion of cash from new debt issued by the Company. We identified and recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values at the King Closing Date and allocated the remaining value of approximately $2.7 billion to goodwill.    25           The final purchase price allocation was as follows (amounts in millions):       During the six months ended June30, 2016, the Company incurred $38 million of expenses related to the King Acquisition, which are included within  General and administrative  in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the debt financing that occurred on the King Closing Date, we incurred $38 million of discounts and financing costs that were capitalized and recorded within  Long-term debt, net  on our condensed consolidated balance sheet.    Share-Based Compensation    In connection with the King Acquisition, a majority of the outstanding King options and awards that were unvested as of the King Closing Date were converted into equivalent options and awards with respect to shares of the Company s common stock, using an equity award exchange ratio calculated in accordance with the transaction agreement. As a result, replacement stock options and equity awards of 10 million and 3 million, respectively, were issued. The portion of the fair value related to pre-combination services of $76 million was included in the purchase price, while the remaining fair value will be recognized over the remaining service periods. As of December31, 2016, the future expense for the converted King unvested stock options and equity awards was approximately $40 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average service period of approximately 1.6 years.    The remaining portion of outstanding unvested awards that were assumed were replaced with deferred cash awards. The cash proceeds were placed in an escrow-like account, with the cash releases occurring as future services are rendered in accordance with the awards  original vesting schedules. The cash associated with these awards is recorded in  Other current assets  and  Other assets  in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The portion of the fair value related to pre-combination services of $22 million was included in the purchase price while the remaining fair value of approximately $9 million will be recognized over the remaining service periods.    Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired and Goodwill    The internally-developed franchises, customer base, developed software, and trade name intangible assets will be amortized to  Cost of revenues subscription, licensing, and other revenues: Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses,   Sales and marketing,   Cost of revenues subscription, licensing, and other revenues: Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses,  and  General and administrative,  respectively. The intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits received.    26           The $2.7 billion of goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the benefits the Company expects to derive from accelerated expansion as an interactive entertainment provider in the mobile sector, future franchises, and technology, as well as the management team s proven ability to create future games and franchises. Approximately $620 million of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes in the U.S.    King Net Revenue and Earnings    The amount of net revenue and earnings attributable to King in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations during the three and six months ended June30, 2016, the period of the King Acquisition, are included in the table below. The amounts presented represent the net revenues and earnings after adjustments for purchase price accounting, inclusive of amortization of intangible assets, share-based payments, and deferral of revenues and related cost of revenues.       Pro Forma Financial Information    The unaudited financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations of the Company and King for the six months ended June30, 2016, on a pro forma basis, as though the acquisition had occurred on January1, 2015. The 2016 pro forma financial information presented includes the effects of adjustments related to amortization charges from acquired intangible assets, employee compensation from replacement equity awards issued in the King Acquisition and the profit-sharing bonus plan established as part of the King Acquisition, and interest expense from the new debt, among other adjustments. We also adjusted for Activision Blizzard and King non-recurring acquisition related costs of approximately $64 million for the six months ended June30, 2016.    The unaudited pro forma financial information as presented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the King Acquisition, and any borrowings undertaken to finance the King Acquisition, had taken place at the beginning of the earliest period presented, nor does it intend to be a projection of future results.       15.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    Inventory    In July2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance related to the measurement of inventory which requires inventory within the scope of the guidance to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We adopted this new standard as of January1, 2017, and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.    27           Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted    Revenue Recognition    In May2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard will replace all current U.S.GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance, providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December15, 2017. We anticipate adopting the accounting standard on January1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method, which recognizes the cumulative effect upon adoption as an adjustment to retained earnings at the adoption date.    As previously disclosed, we believe the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard may have a significant impact on the accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the current accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements is required. This requirement will be eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly, we will be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software, as compared to the current requirement of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated offering period. We expect this difference to primarily impact revenues from our Call of Duty franchise. Many of our other franchises, such as Destiny, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, are hosted service arrangements and we do not expect any significant impact on the accounting for our sales of these games. Nonetheless, this difference may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption of the new guidance.    We are continuing to evaluate the additional impacts of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements and related disclosures.    Leases    In February2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and lessees will need to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for their leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements. Currently, we do not plan to early adopt this new standard.    Financial Instruments    In January2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The new standard, amongst other things, generally requires companies to measure investments in other entities, except those accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The new standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2017, and the guidance should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity investments without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.    28           Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash    In November2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2018, and should be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted.    We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements. We expect there would be a significant impact to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December31, 2015 to facilitate the King Acquisition and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 in connection with the King Acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance would be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, would not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows.    Goodwill    In January2017, the FASB issued new guidance which eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if any entity forgoes a Step 0 test, an entity will be required to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, as determined in Step 1 from the goodwill impairment test, with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge, if any, for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2019 and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.    29

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    Business Overview    Activision Blizzard,Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services across all of the major gaming platforms, including video game consoles, personal computers ( PC ), and mobile devices. The terms  Activision Blizzard,  the  Company,   we,   us,  and  our  are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard,Inc. and its subsidiaries.    The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December1992. We are the result of the 2008 business combination (the  Business Combination ) by and among the Company (then known as Activision,Inc.), VivendiS.A. ( Vivendi ), and Vivendi Games,Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi. In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, Activision,Inc. was renamed Activision Blizzard,Inc.    The common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol  ATVI.     The King Acquisition    On February23, 2016 (the  King Closing Date ), we acquired King Digital Entertainment, a leading interactive mobile entertainment company ( King ), by purchasing all of its outstanding shares (the  King Acquisition ). We made this acquisition because we believe that the addition of King s highly complementary mobile business positions us as a global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console, and PC platforms, as well as positioning us for future growth. The aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8billion was funded primarily with $3.6billion of existing cash and $2.2billion of cash from new debt issued by the Company. King s results of operations since the King Closing Date are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements.    Our Segments    As part of the continued implementation of our esports strategy, we instituted changes to our internal organization and reporting structure such that the Major League Gaming ( MLG ) business now operates as a division of Blizzard Entertainment,Inc. ( Blizzard ). As such, commencing with the second quarter of 2017, MLG, which was previously a separate operating segment, is now a component of the Blizzard operating segment.MLG will be responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League TM , along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for Activision Blizzard esports content.    Based on our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments as follows:    (i)Activision Publishing,Inc.    Activision Publishing,Inc. ( Activision ), is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly in console gaming. Activision primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including full-game sales and in-game purchases, as well as licenses of software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets and sells products which are principally based on our internally-developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties. We have also established a long-term alliance with Bungie to publish its game universe, Destiny.    Activision s key product franchises include: Call of Duty  , a first-person shooter for the console and PC platforms; Destiny, an online universe of first-person action gameplay (which we call a  shared-world shooter ) currently for console platforms; and Skylanders  , a franchise geared towards children that brings physical toys to life digitally in the game, primarily for console platforms.    30           (ii)Blizzard Entertainment,Inc.    Blizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly in PC gaming. Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including subscriptions, full-game sales, and in-game purchases, as well as licenses of software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content, online social connectivity across all Blizzard games, and the creation of user-generated content for Blizzard s games. Commencing with the second quarter of 2017, Blizzard also includes the activities of our MLG business, which is devoted to esports.    Blizzard s key product franchises include: World of Warcraft  , a subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing game ( MMORPG ) for the PC; StarCraft  , a real-time strategy PC franchise; Diablo  , an action role-playing franchise for the PC and console platforms; Hearthstone  , an online collectible card franchise for the PC and mobile platforms; Heroes of the Storm  , a free-to-play team brawler for the PC; and Overwatch  , a team-based first-person shooter for the PC and console platforms.    (iii)King Digital Entertainment    King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS. King also distributes its content and services on online social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King s games are free-to-play, however, players can acquire in-game virtual items, either with virtual currency the players purchase, or directly using real currency.    King s key product franchises, all of which are for the PC and mobile platforms, include: Candy Crush , which features  match three  games; Farm Heroes , which also features  match three  games; Pet Rescue , which is a  clicker  game; and Bubble Witch , which features  bubble shooter  games.    Other    We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:       the Activision Blizzard Studios ( Studios ) business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of globally recognized intellectual properties, and which, in October 2016, released the first season of the animated TV series Skylanders  Academy on Netflix; and       the Activision Blizzard Distribution ( Distribution ) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.    Business Results and Highlights    Financial Results    During the three months ended June30, 2017:       consolidated net revenues increased 4% to $1.63 billion and consolidated operating income increased 46% to $339 million, as compared to consolidated net revenues of $1.57 billion and consolidated operating income of $232 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016;       revenues from digital online channels increased 15% to $1.31 billion, as compared to $1.14 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2016;    31              operating margin was 20.8%, as compared with 14.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2016, with the higher margin being primarily due to an increased percentage of revenues coming from higher-margin online digital channels;       consolidated net income increased 61% to $243 million, as compared to $151 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016;       consolidated net income included $13 million of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, as compared to $24 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016; and       our diluted earnings per common share increased 60% to $0.32, as compared to $0.20 for the three months ended June 30, 2016.    During the six months ended June30, 2017:       consolidated net revenues increased 11% to $3.36 billion and consolidated operating income increased 20% to $831 million, as compared to consolidated net revenues of $3.03 billion and consolidated operating income of $693 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016;       revenues from digital online channels increased 30% to $2.69 billion, as compared to $2.07 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016;       operating margin was 24.8%, as compared with 22.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2016, with the higher margin being primarily due to an increased percentage of revenues coming from higher-margin online digital channels;       cash flows generated from operating activities were $676 million, a decrease of 20%, as compared to $840 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016;       consolidated net income increased 30% to $669 million, as compared to $514 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016;       consolidated net income included $82 million of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, as compared to $51 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016; and       our diluted earnings per common share increased 29% to $0.88, as compared to $0.68 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.    Since certain of our games are hosted or include online functionality that represents an essential component of gameplay and, as a result, a more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable, we initially defer the software-related revenues from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year. Net revenues for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 include a net effect of $213 million and $742 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues. Operating income for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 includes a net effect of $105 million and $501 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues and related cost of revenues.    Release Highlights    Games and digital downloadable content that were released during the three months ended June30, 2017 include:       Activision s Continuum , the second downloadable content pack for Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare  ;       Activision s Call of Duty: Black Ops III Zombies Chronicles , a downloadable content pack of remastered zombies maps from Call of Duty: World at War, Call of Duty: Black Ops , and Call of Duty: Black Ops II ;       Activision s Crash Bandicoot  N. Sane Trilogy , a remastered version for PlayStation 4 of the first three Crash Bandicoot games;       Blizzard s Journey to Un Goro  , the latest expansion to Hearthstone ; and       Blizzard s Rise of the Necromancer  , a downloadable content pack for Diablo III.    32           Monthly Active Users: Measuring the Size of Our User Base    We monitor monthly active users ( MAUs ) as a key measure of the overall size of our user base. MAUs are the number of individuals who played a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period. An individual who plays two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user.    The number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may cause a temporary surge in MAUs. Accordingly, although we believe that overall trending in the number of MAUs can be a meaningful performance metric, period-to-period fluctuations may not be indicative of longer-term trends. The following table details our average MAUs on a sequential quarterly basis for each of our reportable segments (amounts in millions):       Average MAUs decreased by 24 million, or 6%, for the quarter ended June30, 2017, as compared to the quarter ended March31, 2017. The decrease in King s average MAUs is due to decreases across franchises reflecting the maturity of released titles, as well as a decrease in Bubble Witch 3 Saga MAUs during the current quarter given the title launched in the prior quarter. The increase in Blizzard s average MAUs is due primarily to higher MAUs for the Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm franchises, in part due to content and feature releases during the quarter.    Average MAUs decreased by 84million, or 17%, for the quarter ended June30, 2017, as compared to the quarter ended June30, 2016. The decrease in King s average MAUs is due to decreases across King s franchises that are largely attributable to less engaged users leaving the network. This decrease is partially offset by the increase in Blizzard s average MAUs, driven by the release of Overwatch in May2016, along with higher MAUs for the Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm franchises.    Management s Overview of Business Trends    Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth    Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 19% annually over the last four calendar years. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions increasingly gain access to this form of entertainment.    33           Further, the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable market for gaming significantly. Smart phones and associated free-to-play games have introduced gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowed gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is now estimated to be larger than console and PC gaming and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games. In addition, our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to drive additional player investment from our franchises.    Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games    Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full games or downloadable content, or via microtransactions. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging opportunities to drive player investment outside of game purchases. These opportunities include esports, film and television, and consumer products. Our efforts to build these additional opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially significant sources of future revenues.    As part of our efforts to take advantage of the esports opportunity, and as announced in July2017, we completed the sale of the first Overwatch League TM  teams for major global cities to seven entrepreneurs and leaders from esports and traditional sports. The Overwatch League is the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams.    Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises    The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive software industry. According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 32% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2016. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues have historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games were responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively, accounted for 69% of our consolidated net revenues, and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income, for 2016.    The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. Each of the top 10 console franchises in 2016 was a previously established franchise. Similarly, according to U.S rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, per App Annie Intelligence as of June2017, the top 10 mobile games have an average tenure of 26months.    In addition to investing in and developing sequels and content for our top titles, we are continually exploring additional ways to expand those franchises. Further, we invest in new properties in an effort to develop the future top franchises. In 2014, we released Hearthstone and Destiny, in 2015, we released Heroes of the Storm, and in 2016, we released Overwatch. There is no guarantee these investments will result in established franchises. Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase our presence in the mobile market, on February23, 2016, we acquired King.    Overall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industry s, revenues and profits in the near future. Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors  top franchises can significantly impact our performance.    Recurring Revenue Business Models    Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business to a more recurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenue, it can also increase engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal.    34           Consolidated Statements of Operations Data    The following table sets forth condensed consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated in dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues, except for cost of revenues, which are presented as a percentage of associated revenues (amounts in millions):       Consolidated Net Revenues    The following table summarizes our consolidated net revenues and the increase/(decrease) in deferred net revenues recognized for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 (amounts in millions):       35           Consolidated Net Revenues    Q2 2017 vs. Q2 2016    The increase in consolidated net revenues for the three months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the three months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to:       higher revenues recognized from Overwatch , which was released in May 2016; and       higher revenues recognized from World of Warcraft , driven by the release of World of Warcraft: Legion   in August 2016, with no comparable release in 2015.    The increase was partially offset by lower revenues recognized from the Call of Duty franchise, primarily due to the performance of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare (which, when referred to herein, is inclusive of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered ) , which was released in November 2016, as compared to the performance of Call of Duty: Black Ops III , the comparable 2015 title.    YTD Q2 2017 vs. YTD Q2 2016    The increase in consolidated net revenues for the six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to:       higher revenues recognized from Overwatch ;       higher revenues from King titles, driven by the Candy Crush franchise, as the current period includes King revenues for the full year-to-date period, while the comparable prior period only included King revenues for the partial period following the King Closing Date; and       higher revenues recognized from World of Warcraft , driven by the release of World of Warcraft: Legion  in August 2016, with no comparable release in 2015 .    The increase was partially offset by lower revenues recognized from the Call of Duty franchise, primarily due to the performance of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, as compared tothe performance of Call of Duty: Black Ops III.    Change in Deferred Revenues Recognized    Q2 2017 vs. Q2 2016    The increase in net deferred revenues recognized for the three months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the three months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to higher deferred revenues recognized from Overwatch. The increase was partially offset by lower deferred revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, as compared toCall of Duty: Black Ops III.    YTD Q2 2017 vs. YTD Q2 2016    The increase in net deferred revenues recognized for the six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to:       net deferred revenues recognized from Overwatch in 2017 as compared to a net deferral of revenues in the comparable prior period due to Overwatch  s release in May 2016; and       higher deferred revenues recognized from World of Warcraft , driven by deferred revenues recognized from World of Warcraft: Legion .    The increase was partially offset by lower deferred revenues recognized from the Call of Duty franchise, primarily due to the performance of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, as compared toCall of Duty: Black Ops III.    36           Foreign Exchange Impact    Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $28 million and $61 million on Activision Blizzard s consolidated net revenues for the three and six months ended June30, 2017, respectively, as compared to the impact on net revenues for the three and six months ended June30, 2016. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and British pound.    Operating Segment Results    Currently, we have three reportable segments. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker ( CODM ). The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of: the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; share-based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting; fees and other expenses (including legal fees, expenses, and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities, and financings; certain restructuring costs; and other non-cash charges. The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly, no disclosure is made with respect thereto.    Our operating segments are also consistent with our internal organization structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments. As discussed in the  Business Overview  above, commencing with the second quarter of 2017, we made changes to our operating segments which reflect the changes in our organization and reporting structure. Our MLG business, which was previously included in the non-reportable  Other segments,  is now presented within the Blizzard reportable operating segment. Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect this change. This change had no impact on consolidated net revenues or operating income.    37           Information on the reportable segments and reconciliations of total segment net revenues and total segment operating income to consolidated net revenues from external customers and consolidated income before income tax expense for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 are presented in the table below (amounts in millions):        (1)  Other segments include other income and expenses from operating segments managed outside the reportable segments, including our Studios and Distribution businesses. Other segments also include unallocated corporate income and expenses.    (2)  Reflects fees and other expenses, such as legal, banking and professional services fees, primarily related to the King Acquisition and associated integration activities, inclusive of related debt financings.    (3)  Reflects restructuring charges incurred, primarily severance costs.    (4)  Reflects a non-cash accounting charge to reclassify certain cumulative translation losses into earnings due to the substantial liquidation of certain of our foreign entities.    38           Segment Net Revenues    Activision    Q2 2017 vs. Q2 2016    The decrease in Activision s net revenues for the three months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the three months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to lower revenues from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2016, as compared toCall of Duty: Black Ops III, the comparable 2015 title.    The decrease was partially offset by:       revenues from the Call of Duty: Black Ops III downloadable content pack, Zombies Chronicles , which was released in May 2017, with no comparable prior year release, as well as continued in-game microtransactions from Call of Duty: Black Ops III; and       revenues from the release of the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy in June 2017.    YTD Q2 2017 vs. YTD Q2 2016    The decrease in Activision s net revenues for the six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to the same drivers and partially offsetting factors as those for the three months ended June30, 2017 discussed above.    Blizzard    Q2 2017 vs. Q2 2016    The decrease in Blizzard s net revenues for the three months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the three months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to lower revenues from Overwatch, which was released in May2016. The decrease was partially offset by the prior-year negative impact of a reserve established in the second quarter of 2016 due to a value-added tax (VAT) audit, with no comparable reserve established for the three months ended June30, 2017.    YTD Q2 2017 vs. YTD Q2 2016    The decrease in Blizzard s net revenues for the six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to lower revenues from Overwatch, partially offset by higher revenues from World of Warcraft.    King    Q2 2017 vs. Q2 2016    King s net revenues for the three months ended June30, 2017, were comparable to net revenues for the three months ended June30, 2016. This was driven by slight declines in revenues across King s various franchises, partially offset by higher revenues from the Bubble Witch franchise due to the release of Bubble Witch 3 Saga at the beginning of 2017.    YTD Q2 2017 vs. YTD Q2 2016    The increase in King s net revenues for the six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to the current period including King revenues for the full year-to-date period, while the comparable prior period only included King revenues for the partial period following the King Closing Date.    39           Segment Income from Operations    Activision    Q2 2017 vs. Q2 2016    Activision s operating income for the three months ended June30, 2017, was comparable to the three months ended June30, 2016, despite the decrease in revenues discussed above. This was driven by:       an increased percentage of revenues coming from higher-margin online digital channels;       lower product development costs from the Skylanders franchise, as we do not have a new release title planned for 2017; and       offset by, higher sales and marketing costs for the Destiny franchise given the expected Destiny 2 release in September 2017, with no comparable release in the prior year.    YTD Q2 2017 vs. YTD Q2 2016    The decrease in Activision s operating income for the six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to the lower revenues discussed above. The decrease was also due to higher sales and marketing costs for the Destiny franchise given the expected Destiny 2 release in September2017, with no comparable release in the prior year.    The decrease was partially offset by:       lower product development costs, driven by lower costs for the Skylanders franchise and lower accrued bonuses; and       lower sales and marketing costs for the Skylanders franchise, as we do not have a new release title planned for 2017.    Blizzard    Q2 2017 vs. Q2 2016    The decrease in Blizzard s operating income for the three months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the three months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to the lower revenues discussed above. This was partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs for Overwatch given its launch in May2016.    YTD Q2 2017 vs. YTD Q2 2016    The decrease in Blizzard s operating income for the six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to higher product development costs resulting from lower capitalization of software development costs due to the timing of game development cycles. This was partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs for Overwatch given its launch in May2016.    40           King    Q2 2017 vs. Q2 2016    The decrease in King s operating income for the three months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the three months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to slightly higher product development and sales and marketing costs, partially offset by lower professional services fees.    YTD Q2 2017 vs. YTD Q2 2016    The increase in King s operating income for the six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to the current period including King s results of operations for the full year-to-date period, while the comparable prior period only included King s results of operations for the partial period following the King Closing Date.    Foreign Exchange Impact    Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $18 million and $33 million on reportable segment net revenues for the three and six months ended June30, 2017, respectively, as compared to the impact on reportable segment net revenues for the three and six months ended June30, 2016. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and British pound.

YTD Q2 2017 vs. YTD Q2 2016    The increase in game operations and distribution costs for the six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to higher online costs and platform provider fees associated with revenues from King, as the current period includes King s costs for a full year-to-date period, while the comparable prior period only included King s revenues and associated costs for the partial period following the King Closing Date.    The increase in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for the six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to a full year-to-date period amortization of internally-developed franchise intangible assets acquired in the King Acquisition, while the comparable prior period only included a partial period of amortization of internally-developed franchise intangible assets following the King Closing Date.    Product Development (amounts in millions)       Q2 2017 vs. Q2 2016    Product development costs for the three months ended June30, 2017, were comparable to the three months ended June30, 2016.    YTD Q2 2017 vs. YTD Q2 2016    The increase in product development costs for the six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to:       higher Blizzard product development costs to support current and future releases and lower capitalization of software development costs due to the timing of game development cycles; and       increased costs related to King, as the current period includes a full year-to-date period of costs, while the comparable prior period only included King s costs for the partial period following the King Closing Date.    The increase was partially offset by lower Activision product development costs, driven by lower accrued bonuses.    48           Sales and Marketing (amounts in millions)       Q2 2017 vs. Q2 2016    The decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the three months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to lower sales and marketing costs for Overwatch given it launched in May2016. The decrease was partially offset by higher sales and marketing costs for the Destiny franchise given the expected Destiny 2 release in September2017, with no comparable release in the prior year.    YTD Q2 2017 vs. YTD Q2 2016    The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to:       increased amortization of the customer base intangible assets acquired in the King Acquisition and increased sales and marketing costs to support King s titles, as the current period includes a full year-to-date period of costs, while the comparable prior period only included King s costs for the partial period following the King Closing Date; and       higher sales and marketing costs for the Destiny franchise given the expected Destiny 2 release in September 2017, with no comparable release in the prior year.    The increase was partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs for Overwatch given it launched in May2016.    General and Administrative (amounts in millions)       Q2 2017 vs. Q2 2016    For the three months ended June30, 2017, general and administrative expenses were comparable to the three months ended June30, 2016.    49           YTD Q2 2017 vs. YTD Q2 2016    The increase in general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to:       increased personnel costs to support the growth of our business and expanding areas of opportunity; and       the inclusion in the current period of a non-cash accounting charge to reclassify certain losses included in our cumulative translation adjustments into earnings due to the substantial liquidation of certain of our foreign entities.    The increase was partially offset by lower transaction costs, as the six months ended June30, 2016 included the King Acquisition.    Interest and Other Expense (Income), Net (amounts in millions)       The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net for the three and six months ended June30, 2017, as compared to the three and six months ended June30, 2016, was primarily due to our lower total outstanding debt and lower interest rates on our current debt instruments as a result of our refinancing activities in 2016 and 2017.    The decreases were partially offset by write-offs of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs as a result of our debt refinancing and paydown activities. See further discussion below under  Liquidity and Capital Resources.     Income Tax Expense (amounts in millions)       The income tax expense of $50 million for the three months ended June30, 2017, reflects an effective tax rate of 17%, which is higher than the effective tax rate of 10% for the three months ended June30, 2016.The increase is due to a decrease in excess tax benefits from share-based payments and an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at relatively lower statutory rates.    The income tax expense of $77 million for the six months ended June30, 2017, reflects an effective tax rate of 10%, which is lower than the effective tax rate of 11% for the six months ended June30, 2016.The decrease is due to an increase in excess tax benefits from share-based payments and a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at relatively lower statutory rates, partially offset by an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions.    The effective tax rate of 17% and 10% for the three and six months ended June30, 2017, respectively, is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower statutory rates, the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, and the recognition of federal and California research and development credits, partially offset by an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions.    50           Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory U.S. income tax rate due to the effect of state and local income taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including, but not limited to: variations in the estimated and actual level of pre-tax income or loss by jurisdiction; changes in the mix of income by tax jurisdiction (as taxes are levied at relatively lower statutory rates in foreign regions and relatively higher statutory rates in the U.S.); research and development credits; changes in enacted tax laws and regulations, rulings, and interpretations thereof, including with respect to tax credits, and state and local income taxes; developments in tax audits and other matters;recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from share-based payments; and certain nondeductible expenses. Changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition, or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of the change.    Further information about our income taxes is provided in Note10 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item1 of this Quarterly Report on Form10-Q.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. In the near term, we expect our business to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows. Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities. With our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.3 billion at June30, 2017, and the expected cash flows provided by our operating activities, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet daily operations for the foreseeable future. We also believe that we have sufficient working capital ($2.6 billion at June30, 2017) to finance our operational and financing requirements for at least the next 12 months. Additionally, we have the availability of a $250million revolving credit facility.    As of June30, 2017, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $2.1 billion, as compared to $1.9 billion as of December31, 2016. If the cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are needed in the future for our operations in the U.S., we would accrue and pay the required U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.    Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.    Sources of Liquidity (amounts in millions)       51              Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities    The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with our operating activities include the collection of customer receivables generated from the sale of our products and services. These collections are typically partially offset by: payments to vendors for the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of our products; payments for customer service support for our consumers; payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders; payments for interest on our debt; payments for software development; payments for tax liabilities; and payments to our workforce.    Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June30, 2017 was $676 million, as compared to $840 million for the six months ended June30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of the launches of our games, as the prior period included cash flows from the launch of Overwatch in May2016, with no comparable launch in the current period. The decrease was partially offset by:       higher net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016, along with larger adjustments to net income for non-cash charges, which were primarily associated with the amortization of the acquired intangibles in the King Acquisition; and       changes in our working capital due to the timing of collections and payments.    Net Cash Used in Investing Activities    The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.    Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June30, 2017 was $41 million, as compared to $1.1 billion for the six months ended June30, 2016.The decrease in the cash used was primarily due to cash used for the King Acquisition in the six months ended June30, 2016, with no comparable transaction in the current period.    Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities    The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends.    Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June30, 2017 was $652 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $746 million for the six months ended June30, 2016. The change was primarily attributed to our debt financing activities. For the six months ended June30, 2017, we had net debt repayments of $500 million, as compared to approximately $950 million of net debt proceeds for the six months ended June30, 2016. The cash flows used in financing activities for the six months ended June30, 2017 were partially offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises of $130 million, as compared to $60 million for the six months ended June30, 2016.    52           Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes    Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $50 million and a negative impact of $25 million on our cash and cash equivalents for the six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and the Euro.    Debt    As of December31, 2016, our total outstanding debt was $4.9 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 2.92%.    On February3, 2017, we entered into a sixth amendment (the  Sixth Amendment ) to our credit agreement, which was originally executed on October11, 2013 (as amended thereafter and from time to time, the  Credit Agreement ). The Sixth Amendment: (i)provided for a new tranche of term loans  A  in an aggregate principal amount of $2.55billion (the  2017 TLA ) and (ii)released each of our subsidiary guarantors from their respective guarantees provided under the Credit Agreement. All proceeds of the 2017 TLA, together with additional cash on hand of $139 million, were used to fully retire the term loans then outstanding (the  2016 TLA ) under the Credit Agreement, including all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The terms of the 2017 TLA, other than the absence of the subsidiary guarantees, are generally the same as the terms of the 2016 TLA. The fees incurred as a result of the Sixth Amendment were not material. The 2017 TLA will mature on August23, 2021.    On May26, 2017, in a public underwritten offering, we issued three series of unsecured senior notes $400 million of 2.6% unsecured senior notes due June2022, $400 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due June2027, and $400 million of 4.5% unsecured senior notes due June2047. The proceeds from these unsecured senior notes, together with cash on hand, were used to make a prepayment of $1.2 billion on our 2017 TLA.    During the six months ended June30, 2017, we reduced our total outstanding long-term debt by $500 million. This included $139 million of cash used to retire the 2016 TLA, as discussed above, along with a prepayment on the 2017 TLA of $361 million. The prepayment made on our 2017 TLA satisfied the remaining required quarterly principal repayments for the entire term of the Credit Agreement.    As a result of the above activities, our total outstanding debt as of June30, 2017 was $4.4 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 3.52%. A summary of our debt as of June30, 2017, is as follows (amounts in millions):       53           A summary of our debt as of December31, 2016, was as follows (amounts in millions):       Refer to Note7 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item1 of this Quarterly Report on Form10-Q for further disclosures regarding our debt obligations.    Dividends    On February2, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share. On May10, 2017, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $226 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March30, 2017. On May26, 2017, we made related dividend equivalent payments of less than $1 million to certain holders of restricted stock units.    Capital Expenditures    For the year ending December31, 2017, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $135 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases.During the six months ended June30, 2017, capital expenditures were $52 million.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    At June30, 2017 and December31, 2016, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, often referred to as  structured finance  or  special purpose  entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that they are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments, or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions, and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, include the following:       Revenue Recognition including Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables;     Allowances for Returns and Price Protection;     Allowance for Inventory Obsolescence;     Software Development Costs;     Income Taxes;     Fair Value Estimates (including Business Combinations and Assessment of Impairment of Assets); and     Share-Based Payments.    During the six months ended June30, 2017, there were no significant changes to the above critical accounting policies and estimates. Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in PartII,Item7 of our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2016, for a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.    54           Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    Below are recently issued accounting pronouncements that were most significant to our accounting policy activities. For a detailed discussion of all relevant recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note15 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item1 of this Quarterly Report on Form10-Q.    Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    Inventory    In July2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance related to the measurement of inventory which requires inventory within the scope of the guidance to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We adopted this new standard as of January1, 2017, and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted    Revenue Recognition    In May2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard will replace all current U.S.GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance, providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December15, 2017. We anticipate adopting the accounting standard on January1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method, which recognizes the cumulative effect upon adoption as an adjustment to retained earnings at the adoption date.    As previously disclosed, we believe the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard may have a significant impact on the accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the current accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements is required. This requirement will be eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly, we will be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software, as compared to the current requirement of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated offering period. We expect this difference to primarily impact revenues from our Call of Duty franchise. Many of our other franchises, such as Destiny, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, are hosted service arrangements and we do not expect any significant impact on the accounting for our sales of these games. Nonetheless, this difference may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption of the new guidance.    We are continuing to evaluate the additional impacts of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements and related disclosures.    55           Leases    In February2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and lessees will need to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for their leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements. Currently, we do not plan to early adopt this new standard.    Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash    In November2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2018, and should be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted.    We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements. We expect there would be a significant impact to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December31, 2015 to facilitate the King Acquisition and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 in connection with the King Acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance would be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, would not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows.
