AND SUBSIDIARIES  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  (Unaudited)    1.  Description of Business and Basis of Consolidation and Presentation    Activision Blizzard,Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment. The terms  Activision Blizzard,  the  Company,   we,   us,  and  our  are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard,Inc. and its subsidiaries. We currently offer games for video game consoles, personal computers ( PC ), and handheld, mobile, and tablet devices. We maintain significant operations in the United States ( U.S. ), Canada, the United Kingdom ( U.K. ), France, Germany,Ireland,Italy, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia, South Korea, and China.    Activision Blizzard is the result of the 2008 business combination ( Business Combination ) by and among the Company (then known as Activision,Inc.), Sego Merger Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision,Inc., VivendiS.A. ( Vivendi ), VGACLLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, and Vivendi Games,Inc. ( Vivendi Games ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of VGACLLC. As a result of the consummation of the Business Combination, Activision,Inc. was renamed Activision Blizzard,Inc.    As of December31, 2015, ASAC II LP, an exempted limited partnership established under the laws of the Cayman Islands ( ASAC LP ), held approximately 172 million shares, or approximately 23% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at that time. Robert A. Kotick, our Chief Executive Officer, and Brian G. Kelly, Chairman of our Board of Directors, are the managers of ASAC II LLC, the general partner of ASAC LP ( ASAC GP ). On June8, 2016, ASAC GP distributed the approximately 141 million shares allocable to the limited partners of ASAC LP to those limited partners. On July7, 2016, ASAC LP distributed approximately 18 million of its remaining approximately 31 million shares to ASAC GP. On August15, 2016, ASAC GP sold approximately 4 million shares of our common stock and distributed 14 million shares pro rata to its members, consisting of trusts for the benefit of Messrs.Kotick and Kelly, which shares were ultimately sold on that day for financial and estate-planning purposes. On August19, 2016, ASAC LP distributed its remaining shares of common stock to ASAC GP, leaving ASAC LP without any shares and ASAC GP with approximately 13 million shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 2% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of September30, 2016. We did not receive any proceeds from any of the distributions or sales of the shares.    The common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol  ATVI.     The King Acquisition    On November2, 2015, we and King Digital Entertainmentplc ( King ), a leading interactive mobile entertainment company, entered into a transaction agreement (the  Transaction Agreement ) under the terms of which we would acquire King (the  King Acquisition ) and King would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On February23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition, as further described in Note 14 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the operations of King commencing on February23, 2016.    Reportable Segments    Based upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable operating segments as follows:    (i)Activision Publishing,Inc.    Activision Publishing,Inc. ( Activision ) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and content. Activision delivers content to a broad range of gamers, ranging from children to adults, and from core gamers to mass-market consumers, in a variety of geographies. Activision develops, markets, and sells products through retail channels or digital downloads, which are principally based on our internally-developed intellectual properties, including games in the Call of Duty   and Skylanders   franchises, as well as some licensed properties. Additionally, we have established a long-term alliance with Bungie to publish its game universe, Destiny. Activision currently offers games that operate on the Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ) Xbox One ( Xbox One ) and Xbox 360 ( Xbox 360 ), Nintendo Co. Ltd. ( Nintendo ) Wii U ( Wii U ) and Wii ( Wii ), and Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. ( Sony ) PlayStation 4 ( PS4 ) and PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) console systems; the PC; the Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo Dual Screen, and Sony PlayStation Vita handheld game systems; and mobile and tablet devices.    9           (ii)Blizzard Entertainment,Inc.    Blizzard Entertainment,Inc. ( Blizzard ) is a leader in online PC gaming, including the subscription-based massively multi-player online role-playing game category, in terms of both subscriber base and revenues generated through its World of Warcraft   franchise. Blizzard also develops, markets, and sells role-playing action and strategy games for the PC, console, mobile and tablet platforms, including games in the multiple-award winning Diablo  , StarCraft  , Hearthstone  : Heroes of Warcraft   , and Heroes of the Storm   franchises. On May 24, 2016, Blizzard added a new franchise, Overwatch  , a team-based first-person shooter available on the PC and console platforms. In addition, Blizzard maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Battle.net  , which facilitates digital distribution and online social connectivity across all Blizzard games. Blizzard distributes its products and generates revenues worldwide through various means, including: subscriptions; sales of prepaid subscription cards; in-game purchases and services; retail sales of physical  boxed  products; online sales of downloadable PC products; purchases and downloads via third-party console, mobile, and tablet platforms; and licensing of software to third-party or related party companies that distribute Blizzard products.    (iii)King Digital Entertainment Limited    King Digital Entertainment Limited ( King ) is a leading interactive mobile entertainment company that develops and distributes games on mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS, and on online and social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King has four established free-to-play franchises: Candy Crush   , Farm Heroes   , Bubble Witch   , and Pet Rescue   , where monetization occurs through players purchasing virtual items and in-game virtual currency.    (iv)Other    We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:       The Major League Gaming ( MLG ) business (which we formerly referred to as Activision Blizzard Media Networks or Media Networks), which is devoted to eSports and builds on our competitive gaming efforts by creating ways to deliver best-in-class fan experiences across games, platforms, and geographies with a long-term strategy of monetization through advertising, sponsorships, tournaments, and premium content.       The Activision Blizzard Studios ( Studios ) business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our extensive library of iconic and globally-recognized intellectual properties.       The Activision Blizzard Distribution ( Distribution ) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistical, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.    Basis of Consolidation and Presentation    The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rulesand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim reporting. Accordingly, certain notes or other information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted if they substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the annual audited consolidated financial statements. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2015.    10           The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for the fair statement of our financial position and results of operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.    The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.    The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued, to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosures.    Cost of revenues presentation    In periods prior to the second quarter of 2016, we presented cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations in four financial statement captions:  Cost of sales - product costs,    Cost of sales - online,   Cost of sales - software royalties and amortization,  and  Cost of sales - intellectual property licenses.  Commencing with the second quarter of 2016, we have revised the presentation in our condensed consolidated statements of operations to more clearly align our costs of revenues with the associated revenue captions as follows:    Cost of revenues - product sales:    (i)   Product costs  - includes the manufacturing costs of goods produced and sold. These generally include product costs, manufacturing royalties, net of volume discounts, personnel-related costs, warehousing, and distribution costs. We generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned (typically in connection with the achievement of unit-based milestones).    (ii)   Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses  - includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties attributable to product sales revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released, at which time the capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable to product sales revenues.    Cost of revenues - subscription, licensing, and other revenues:    (i)   Game operations and distribution costs  - includes costs to operate our games, such as customer service, internet bandwidth and server costs, platform provider fee, and payment provider fees.    (ii)   Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses  - includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties attributable to subscription, licensing and other revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released, at which time the capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable to subscription, licensing and other revenues.    11           Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    During the nine months ended September30, 2016, there were no significant changes to our accounting policies but we did expand the accounting policy disclosure for revenue recognition to include virtual currency as noted below. Refer to Note 2 contained in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2015 for our full summary of significant accounting policies.    Microtransaction Revenues    Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual goods and currencies to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods and currencies are initially recorded in deferred revenues. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as a player uses the virtual goods purchased with the virtual currency. We categorize our virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time. We recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player, which is generally the estimated service period of the game.    Supplemental Cash Flow Information: Non-cash investing and financing activities    For the nine months ended September30, 2016, we had non-cash purchase price consideration of $89 million related to vested and unvested stock options and awards that were assumed and replaced with Activision Blizzard equity or deferred cash awards in the King Acquisition. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion.    2.  Inventories, Net    Our inventories, net consist of the following (amounts in millions):       At September30, 2016, and December31, 2015, inventory reserves were $52 million and $54 million, respectively.    12           3.  Software Development and Intellectual Property Licenses    The following table summarizes the components of our capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses (amounts in millions):       Intellectual property licenses are classified within  Other current assets  and  Other assets  in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.    Amortization of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses was the following (amounts in millions):       4.  Intangible Assets, Net    Intangible assets, net consist of the following (amounts in millions):       13              The balances of intangible assets, net presented in the table above at September30, 2016, does not include license agreement intangible assets that were fully amortized at December31, 2015, and hence have been removed from the September30, 2016 balances, as presented. Amortization expense of intangible assets was $211 million and $496 million for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, respectively. Amortization expense of intangible assets was $2 million and $5 million for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015, respectively.    At September30, 2016, future amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is estimated as follows (amounts in millions):       5.  Goodwill    The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by operating segment for the nine months ended September30, 2016, are as follows (amounts in millions):       The addition to goodwill through acquisition is attributed to the King Acquisition (see Note14 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements).    14           6.  Fair Value Measurements    Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) literature regarding fair value measurements for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of  observable inputs  and minimize the use of  unobservable inputs.  The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:       Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;       Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and       Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.    Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis    The table below segregates all financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value at the measurement date (amounts in millions):       15              ARS represented the only level3 investment held by the Company. There were no changes in the fair value of these investments for the nine months ended September30, 2016.    Foreign Currency Forward Contracts    Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges    For foreign currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate risk from foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, and earnings that are not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with FASB Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) Topic 815, changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives are recorded within  General and administrative expenses  and  Interest and other expense (income), net  in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, consistent with the nature of the underlying transactions.    At September30, 2016, the gross notional amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges was approximately $165 million. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts was $4 million as of September30, 2016, and recorded in  Other current assets  in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.    At December31, 2015, the gross notional amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges was approximately $489 million. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts was $11 million as of December31, 2015, and recorded in  Other current assets  in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.    For the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015, pre-tax net gains associated with these forward contracts were not material.    Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Hedges    For foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge forecasted intercompany cash flows that are subject to foreign currency risk and which we designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC Topic 815, we assess the effectiveness of these cash flow hedges at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine if the hedges are effective at providing offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. We record the effective portion of changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives in  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  and subsequently reclassify the related amount of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings within  General and administrative expense  when the hedged item impacts earnings. Cash flows from these foreign currency forward contracts are classified in the same category as the cash flows associated with the hedged item in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. We measure hedge ineffectiveness, if any, and if it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, we will discontinue hedge accounting for the derivative.    16           The gross notional amount of all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was approximately $599 million at September30, 2016, and $381 million at December31, 2015. These foreign currency forward contracts have remaining maturities of 15 months or less. During the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, and 2015, there was no ineffectiveness relating to these hedges. At September30, 2016, $4 million of net unrealized losses related to these contracts are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.    During the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015, the amount pre-tax net realized gains reclassified out of  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  due to maturity of these contracts was not material.    Fair Value Measurements on a Non-Recurring Basis    We measure the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis, generally annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.    For the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, and 2015, there were no impairment charges related to assets that are measured on a non-recurring basis.    7.  Debt    Credit Facilities    On October11, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) for a $2.5 billion secured term loan facility maturing in October2020 (the  Term Loan ), and a $250 million secured revolving credit facility (the  Original Revolver ). As of December31, 2015, as a result of repayments and prepayments during the prior periods, we had $1.9 billion outstanding under the Term Loan.    In conjunction with the King Acquisition, we entered into three amendments to the Credit Agreement (the  Amendments ). The Amendments, among other things, provided for incremental term loans in the form of trancheA term loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.3 billion. The proceeds were provided on February23, 2016 and were used to fund the King Acquisition. On March31, 2016, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Credit Agreement which provided for an incremental tranche A term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $250 million (together with the $2.3 billion tranche A term loans, the  Existing TLA ); the proceeds from the incremental borrowing were used to make a voluntary prepayment on our Term Loan on March31, 2016. In addition to this prepayment, we made voluntary prepayments on our Term Loan of $500 million and $800 million on February25 and May26, 2016, respectively.    On August23, 2016 we entered into a fifth amendment to the Credit Agreement (the  Fifth Amendment ) that provided for new tranche A term loans of approximately $2.9 billion (the  New TLA ) and an amended revolving credit facility of $250 million (the  Revolver  and together with the New TLA, the  Credit Facilities ). Both the New TLA and Revolver are scheduled to mature on August23, 2021 and are unsecured. The proceeds from the New TLA were primarily used to pay off the remaining outstanding principal balance on the Term Loan of $319 million and the Existing TLA of $2.5 billion. As a result of the payments to extinguish the Term Loan and Existing TLA, we wrote-off unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $10 million, which is included in  Interest and other expense (income), net  in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The remaining unamortized discount and deferred financing costs were deferred, along with new fees paid to the New TLA lenders, and will continue to be amortized over the maturity of the New TLA. Debt discounts and deferred financing costs incurred in relation to the Fifth Amendment were not material.    17           Borrowings under the Revolver may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed by the Company, and are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Up to $50 million of the Revolver may be used for letters of credit. To date, we have not drawn on the Revolver. Borrowings under the New TLA and the Revolver will bear interest, at the Company s option, at either (a)a base rate equal to the highest of (i)the federal funds rate, plus 0.5%, (ii)the prime commercial lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (iii)the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) for an interest period of one month beginning on such day plus 1.00%, or (b)LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable interest margin. LIBOR will be subject to a floor of 0% and the base rate will be subject to an effective floor of 1.00%. The applicable interest margin for borrowings under the New TLA and Revolver will range from 1.125% to 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings and from 0.125% to 1.00% for base rate borrowings and will be determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company s credit ratings. At September30, 2016, the New TLA bore interest at 1.77%.    The Credit Agreement requires quarterly principal payments of 0.625% of the stated principal amount of the New TLA commencing on September30, 2016, with increases to 1.250% starting on September30, 2019 and 3.125% starting on September30, 2020, with the remaining balance payable on the New TLA s scheduled maturity date of August23, 2021. On September30, 2016, in addition to the required quarterly repayment of $18 million, we made a voluntary prepayment on our New TLA of $167 million. These payments satisfied the required quarterly principal repayments through December31, 2018.    The Company is subject to a financial covenant requiring the Company s Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not to exceed (i)4.00:1.00 on or prior to March31, 2017, and (ii)thereafter, 3.50:1.00. The Fifth Amendment contains other covenants consistent with the Credit Agreement, although the Fifth Amendment provides for additional exceptions from such covenants that are customary for transactions of this type for issuers with similar credit ratings. A violation of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of such event of default or certain other customary events of default, payment of any outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated, and the lenders  commitments to extend credit under the Credit Agreement may be terminated. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement could, under certain circumstances, permit the holders of other outstanding unsecured debt, including the debt holders described below, to accelerate the repayment of such obligations. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the Credit Facilities as of September30, 2016.    The Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain of the Company s U.S. subsidiaries, whose assets represent approximately 68% of our consolidated total assets.    Unsecured Senior Notes    On September19, 2013, we issued, at par, $1.5 billion of 5.625% unsecured senior notes due September2021 (the  Original 2021 Notes ) and $750 million of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due September2023 (the  2023 Notes  and, together with the Original 2021 Notes, the  Notes ) in a private bond offering to qualified institutional buyers made in accordance with Rule144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.    The Notes are general senior obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment to all of the Company s existing and future senior indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities described above. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries. The Notes and related guarantees are not secured and are effectively subordinated to any of the Company s existing and future indebtedness that is secured.    The Original 2021 Notes became eligible for redemption on September15, 2016 (and, as described below, were redeemed on October19, 2016). We may redeem the 2023 Notes on or after September15, 2018, in whole or in part on any one or more occasions, at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of the 2023 Notes prior to September15, 2018, at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a  make-whole premium  and accrued and unpaid interest. Further, upon the occurrence of one or more qualified equity offerings, we may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes outstanding with the net cash proceeds from such offerings.    18           On September19, 2016, we issued $650 million of 2.300% unsecured senior notes due September2021 (the  New 2021 Notes ) and $850 million of 3.400% unsecured senior notes due September2026 (the  2026 Notes  and together with the New 2021 Notes, the  New Notes ) in a private offering made in accordance with Rule144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.    In connection with the issuance of the New Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the  Registration Rights Agreement ), among the Company, the Guarantors and the representatives of the initial purchasers of the New Notes. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to within one year of the issue date of the New Notes, among other things, (1)file a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange each series of the New Notes for new notes that are substantially identical in all material respects, (except for the provisions relating to the transfer restrictions and payment of additional interest) and (2)cause the registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act.    We may redeem the New 2021 Notes on or after August15, 2021, and the 2026 Notes on or after June15, 2026, in whole or in part on any one or more occasions and in each case at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of the New 2021 Notes prior to August15, 2021 and some or all of the 2026 Notes prior to June15, 2026, in each case at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a  make-whole  premium and accrued and unpaid interest.    Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes and New Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These repurchase requirements are considered clearly and closely related to the Notes and New Notes and are not accounted for separately upon issuance.    The Notes contain customary covenants that place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of debt, granting of liens, payment of dividends, sales of assets, and certain merger and consolidation transactions. The New Notes contain customary covenants that place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of secured debt, entry into sale or leaseback transactions, and certain merger or consolidation transactions. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the Notes and New Notes as of September30, 2016.    Interest on the Notes and New Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March15 and September15 of each year. As of September30, 2016, and December31, 2015, we had interest payable of $7 million and $38 million, respectively, related to the Notes and New Notes recorded within  Accrued expenses and other liabilities  in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.    On September19, 2016 we issued an irrevocable notice to the holders of the Original 2021 Notes that we were calling those notes which then had a 30-day period before payment. On October19, 2016 we redeemed the notes in full for $1.6 billion, which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of approximately $82 million, comprised of a premium payment of $63 million and write off of unamortized discount and financing costs of $19 million. This loss was recognized at the time of extinguishment. As a result of the irrevocable notice of redemption, we presented the outstanding principal balance of the Original 2021 Notes and its related unamortized discount and deferred financing costs as  Current portion of long-term debt, net  on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September30, 2016.    Debt Discounts and Deferred Financing Costs    Fees and discounts associated with the closing of our debt instruments are recorded as debt discount, which reduces their respective carrying values, and is amortized over their respective terms. Amortization expense is recorded within  Interest and other expense (income), net  in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.    19           In connection with the debt financing for the Existing TLA and New Notes offering, we incurred $38 million and $17 million of discounts and financing costs, respectively, that were capitalized and recorded within  Long-term debt, net  in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. New lender fees and deferred financing costs related to the New TLA were not material.    For the three and nine months ended September30, 2016: interest expense was $50 million and $158 million, respectively; amortization of the debt discount and deferred financing costs was $4 million and $16 million, respectively; and commitment fees for the Revolver were not material. For the three and nine months ended September30, 2015: interest expense was $48 million and $145 million, respectively; amortization of the debt discount and deferred financing costs for the Credit Facilities and Notes was $2 million and $5 million, respectively; and commitment fees for the Original Revolver were not material.    A summary of our debt is as follows (amounts in millions):       As of September30, 2016, the scheduled maturities and contractual principal repayments of our debt for each of the five succeeding years are as follows (amounts in millions):       20           As of September30, 2016, and December31, 2015, the carrying value of the Term Loan and New TLA approximates the fair value, based on Level 2 inputs (observable market prices in less than active markets), as the interest rate is variable over the selected interest period and is similar to current rates at which we can borrow funds. Based on Level 2 inputs, the fair values of the Original 2021 Notes, 2023 Notes, New 2021 Notes, and 2026 Notes were $1,565 million, $825 million, $652 million, and $854 million, respectively, as of September30, 2016. Based on Level 2 inputs, the fair values of the Original 2021 Notes and 2023 Notes were $1,571 million and $795 million, respectively, as of December31, 2015.    Debt Repayments    On February2, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized debt repayments of up to $1.5 billion of our outstanding debt during 2016. For the nine months ended September30, 2016, we have made payments to reduce our total outstanding term loans by $1.5billion.    8.  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)    The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at September30, 2016 and 2015, were as follows (amounts in millions):       Income taxes were not provided for foreign currency translation items as these are considered indefinite investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.    9.  Operating Segments and Geographic Region    Our operating segments are consistent with our internal organizational structure, the manner in which our operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ), the manner in which we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate financial information. Currently, we have three reportable operating segments (see Note1 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements). We do not aggregate operating segments in determining and disclosing our reportable segments.    The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting, and fees and other expenses related to financings and acquisitions. The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and, accordingly, no disclosure is made with respect thereto. Information on the operating segments and reconciliations of total net revenues and total segment operating income to consolidated net revenues from external customers and consolidated income before income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 are presented below (amounts in millions):    21              (1)  Other includes other income and expenses from operating segments managed outside the reportable segments, including MLG, Studios, and Distribution businesses. Other also includes unallocated corporate income and expenses.    (2)  Reflects fees and other expenses related to the King Acquisition, inclusive of related debt financings and integration costs.    22           Geographic information presented below for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015, is based on the location of the paying customer. Net revenues from external customers by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions):       (1)  EMEA consists of the Europe, Middle East, and Africa geographic regions.    The Company s net revenues in the U.S. were 43% and 46% of consolidated net revenues for the three months ended September30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company s net revenues in the U.K. were 10% and 13% of consolidated net revenues for the three months ended September30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No other country s net revenues exceeded 10% of consolidated net revenues for the three months ended September30, 2016 or 2015.    The Company s net revenues in the U.S. were 46% and 50% of consolidated net revenues for the nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company s net revenues in the U.K. were 10% and 13% of consolidated net revenues for the nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No other country s net revenues exceeded 10% of consolidated net revenues for the nine months ended September30, 2016 or 2015.    Net revenues by platform were as follows (amounts in millions):       (1)  Net revenues from PC includes revenues that were historically shown as Online.  (2)  Net revenues from mobile and ancillary includes revenues from handheld, mobile and tablet devices, as well as non-platform specific game-related revenues such as standalone sales of toys and accessories from our Skylanders franchise and other physical merchandise and accessories.  (3)  Net revenues from Other include revenues from MLG, Studios, and Distribution businesses.    Long-lived assets by geographic region at September30, 2016, and December31, 2015, were as follows (amounts in millions):         (1)  The only long-lived assets that we classify by region are our long-term tangible fixed assets, which only include property, plant, and equipment assets; all other long-term assets are not allocated by location.    23           10.   Income Taxes    The Company accounts for its provision for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740,Income Taxes, which requires an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to be applied to the interim period, taking into account year-to-date amounts and projected results for the full year. The provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state, and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory U.S. income tax rate due to the effect of state and local income taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including, but not limited to: variations in the estimated and actual level of pre-tax income or loss by jurisdiction; changes in the mix of income by tax jurisdiction (as taxes are levied at relatively lower statutory rates in foreign regions and relatively higher statutory rates in the U.S.); research and development credits; changes in enacted tax laws and regulations, rulings, and interpretations thereof, including with respect to tax credits, and state and local income taxes; developments in tax audits and other matters; and certain nondeductible expenses. Changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition, or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of the change.    The income tax expense of $32 million for the three months ended September30, 2016, reflects an effective tax rate of 14%, which is higher than the effective tax rate of 13% for the three months ended September30, 2015. The increase is due to the change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings and increases to the Company s reserve for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments (see Note15 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements) and favorable return to provision adjustments.    The income tax expense of $93 million for the nine months ended September30, 2016, reflects an effective tax rate of 12%, which is lower than the effective tax rate of 20% for the nine months ended September30, 2015. The decrease is due to the change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings, the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, the net benefit related to the settlement of an income tax audit during the first quarter of 2016, and favorable return to provision adjustments, partially offset by increases to the Company s reserve for uncertain tax positions.    The effective tax rate of 14% for the three months ended September30, 2016 differs from the US statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to the tax benefit from foreign earnings taxed at relatively lower statutory rates, the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, the recognition of federal and California research and development credits, favorable return to provision adjustments, and increases to the Company s reserve for uncertain tax positions.    The effective tax rate of 12% for the nine months ended September30, 2016 differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to the tax benefit from foreign earnings taxed at relatively lower statutory rates, the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, the recognition of federal and California research and development credits, the net benefit related to the settlement of an income tax audit during the first quarter of 2016, favorable return to provision adjustments, and increases to the Company s reserve for uncertain tax positions.    The overall effective income tax rate for the year will be dependent, in part, on our profitability for the remainder of the year, as well as the other factors described above.    The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) is currently examining Activision Blizzard s federal tax returns for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax years. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company transitioned the review of its transfer pricing methodology from the advanced pricing agreement review process to the IRS examination team. Their review could result in a different allocation of profits and losses under the Company s transfer pricing agreements. Such allocation could have a positive or negative impact on our provision for uncertain tax positions for the period in which such a determination is reached and the relevant periods thereafter. In addition, as part of purchase price accounting for the King Acquisition, the Company assumed $93 million of uncertain tax positions primarily related to the transfer pricing on King tax years occurring prior to the King Acquisition. The Company is currently in negotiations with the relevant jurisdictions and taxing authorities, which could result in a different allocation of profits and losses between the relevant jurisdictions.    Vivendi Games  results for the period from January1, 2008 through July9, 2008 are included in the consolidated federal and certain foreign state and local income tax returns filed by Vivendi or its affiliates, while Vivendi Games  results for the period from July10, 2008 through December31, 2008 are included in the consolidated federal and certain foreign, state and local income tax returns filed by Activision Blizzard. IRS Appeals proceedings concerning Vivendi Games  tax return for the 2008 tax year were concluded during July2016, but that year remains open to examination by other major taxing authorities. The resolution of the 2008 IRS Appeals process did not have a material impact to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.    24           Certain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation or may be subject to examination or investigation by tax authorities in various jurisdictions, including France. These proceedings may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or provisions for uncertain tax positions. Such proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations in the period or periods in which the matters are resolved or in which appropriate tax provisions are taken into account in our financial statements. If we were to receive a materially adverse assessment from a taxing jurisdiction, we would plan to vigorously contest it and consider all of our options, including the pursuit of judicial remedies.    The final resolution of the Company s global tax disputes is uncertain. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of disputes, including the probability determination and estimation of the potential exposure. Based on current information, in the opinion of the Company s management, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations, except as noted above. However, the Company s global tax disputes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations in the period or periods in which the matters are ultimately resolved or in which appropriate tax provisions are taken into account in our financial statements.    In 2013, in connection with a share repurchase from Vivendi (the  Purchase Transaction ), we assumed certain tax attributes, generally consisting of net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards of approximately $760 million, which represent a potential future tax benefit of approximately $266 million. The utilization of such NOL carryforwards will be subject to certain annual limitations and will begin to expire in 2021. The Company also obtained indemnification from Vivendi against losses attributable to the disallowance of claimed utilization of such NOL carryforwards of up to $200 million in unrealized tax benefits in the aggregate, limited to taxable years ending on or prior to December31, 2016. No benefit for these tax attributes or indemnification was recorded upon the close of the Purchase Transaction. For the nine months ended September30, 2016, we utilized $291 million of the NOL, which resulted in a tax benefit of $102 million, and a corresponding reserve of $102 million was established. As of September30, 2016, an indemnification asset of $191 million has been recorded in  Other Assets,  and, correspondingly, the same amount has been recorded as a reduction to the consideration paid for the shares repurchased in  Treasury Stock.     11.   Computation of Basic/Diluted Earnings Per Common Share    The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in millions, except per share data):       25           Certain of our unvested restricted stock rights (including certain restricted stock units and performance shares) met the definition of participating securities as they participate in earnings based on their rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Therefore, we are required to use the two-class method in our computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share. For the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, on a weighted-average basis, we had outstanding unvested restricted stock rights with respect to 2 million and 3 million shares of common stock, respectively, that are participating in earnings. For the three and nine months ended September30, 2015, on a weighted-average basis, we had outstanding unvested restricted stock rights with respect to 8 million and 9 million shares of common stock, respectively, that are participating in earnings.    Certain of our employee-related restricted stock rights and options are contingently issuable upon the satisfaction of pre-defined performance measures. These shares are included in the weighted-average dilutive common shares only if the performance measures are met as of the end of the reporting period. Approximately 10 million shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, as their respective performance measures had not yet been met. Approximately 4 million shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015, as their respective performance measures had not yet been met.    Potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per common share calculation when the inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, options to acquire 1 million and 4 million shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, respectively, and options to acquire 1 million shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended September30, 2015, as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.    12.   Capital Transactions    Repurchase Program    On February3, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $750 millionof our common stock during the two-year period from February9, 2015 through February8, 2017. As of September30, 2016, we have not repurchased any shares under this program.    Dividends    On February2, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per common share, payable on May11, 2016, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March30, 2016. On May11, 2016, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $192 million to such shareholders, and on May27, 2016, we made related dividend equivalent payments of $3 million to certain holders of restricted stock rights.    On February3, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per common share, payable on May13, 2015, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March30, 2015. On May13, 2015, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $167 million to such shareholders, and on May29, 2015, we made related dividend equivalent payments of $3 million to certain holders of restricted stock rights.    26           13.   Commitments and Contingencies    Legal Proceedings    SEC regulations govern disclosure of legal proceedings in periodic reports and ASC Topic 450 governs the disclosure of loss contingencies and accrual of loss contingencies in respect of litigation and other claims. We record an accrual for a potential loss when it is probable that a loss will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the potential loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum of the range of potential loss is accrued, unless a higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range. Moreover, even if an accrual is not required, we provide additional disclosure related to litigation and other claims when it is reasonably possible (i.e.,more than remote) that the outcomes of such litigation and other claims include potential material adverse impacts on us.    The outcomes of legal proceedings and other claims are subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of these matters, including the probability determination and whether a potential exposure can be reasonably estimated. In making these determinations, we, in consultation with outside counsel, examine the relevant facts and circumstances on a quarterly basis assuming, as applicable, a combination of settlement and litigated outcomes and strategies. Moreover, legal matters are inherently unpredictable and the timing of development of factors on which reasonable judgments and estimates can be based can be slow. As such, there can be no assurance that the final outcome of any legal matter will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows, or liquidity.    We are party to routine claims, suits, investigations, audits, and other proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business, including with respect to intellectual property rights, contractual claims, labor and employment matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, unclaimed property matters, compliance matters, and collection matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, such routine claims and lawsuits are not significant and we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.    14.   Acquisitions    King Digital Entertainment plc    On February23, 2016 (the  King Closing Date ), we completed the King Acquisition under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, purchasing all of the outstanding shares of King. As a result, King became a wholly owned subsidiary of Activision Blizzard. King is a leading interactive entertainment company that develops and distributes games on mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS, and on online and social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King s results of operations since the King Closing Date are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements.    We made this acquisition because we believe that the addition of King s highly-complementary mobile business will position the Company as a global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console, and PC platforms, as well as positioning us for future growth.    27           The aggregate purchase price of the King Acquisition was approximately $5.8 billion, which was paid on the King Closing Date and funded primarily with $3.6 billion of existing cash and $2.2 billion of cash from new debt issued by the Company. The total aggregate purchase price for King was comprised of (amounts in millions):        (1)  Represents the cash consideration paid based on $18.00 per share to common stock holders of King and the fair value of King s existing vested options and awards that were cash settled at the King Closing Date for the portion of the fair value related to pre-combination services. No future services are required.    (2)  Represents the fair value of King s existing vested and unvested stock options and awards that were assumed and replaced with Activision Blizzard equity or deferred cash awards. The purchase price includes the portion of fair value related to pre-combination services. The fair value of the options and awards assumed was determined using binomial-lattice and Monte Carlo models with the following assumptions: (a) volatility of 36%, (b) time varying risk free interest rates based on the U.S. Treasury yield curves, (c) an expected life ranging from approximately 0.1 years to 7.6 years, and (d) an expected dividend yield of 0.9%. See additional discussion under  Stock-Based Compensation  below.    The Company identified and recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values at the King Closing Date, and allocated the remaining value of approximately $2.7 billion to goodwill. The values assigned to certain acquired assets and liabilities are preliminary, and are based on information available as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form10-Q. Additional information may become available subsequently and may result in changes in the values allocated to various assets and liabilities, including the fair value of identified intangible assets, deferred income taxes, and contingent liabilities. Any changes in the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period of up to 12 months from the King Closing Date may result in material adjustments to goodwill. During the three months ended September30, 2016, we recorded a measurement period adjustment for certain liabilities recorded in our preliminary purchase price allocation based on additional analysis of facts and circumstances that existed as of the King Closing Date.The adjustment resulted in an increase to other liabilities and goodwill and was not material.    The preliminary purchase price allocation was as follows (amounts in millions):       28           During the nine months ended September30, 2016, the Company incurred $38 million of expenses related to the King Acquisition, which are included within  General and administrative  in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the debt financing that occurred on the King Closing Date, we incurred $38 million of issuance costs that were capitalized and recorded within  Long-term debt, net  on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The amortization of these capitalized costs was not material to our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016.    Stock-Based Compensation    In connection with the King Acquisition, a majority of the outstanding King options and awards that were unvested as of the King Closing Date were converted into equivalent options and awards with respect to shares of the Company s common stock, using an equity award exchange ratio calculated in accordance with the Transaction Agreement. As a result, replacement equity options and awards of 10 million and 3 million, respectively, were issued in connection with the King Acquisition. The portion of the fair value related to pre-combination services of $76 million was included in the purchase price while the remaining fair value will be recognized over the remaining service periods. As of September30, 2016, the future expense for the converted King unvested options and awards was approximately $53 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average service period of approximately 1.8 years.    The remaining portion of outstanding unvested awards that were assumed were replaced with deferred cash awards. The cash proceeds were placed in an escrow-like account with the cash releases to occur based on the awards  original vesting schedule upon future service being rendered. The cash associated with these awards is recorded in  Other current assets  and  Other assets  in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The portion of the fair value related to pre-combination services of $22 million was included in the purchase price while the remaining fair value of approximately $9 million will be recognized over the remaining service periods. A portion of the cash proceeds placed in an escrow-like account were released to award holders, but the amount was not material.    Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired and Goodwill    The preliminary fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired from King were estimated using an income approach, with the exception of the customer base, which was estimated using a cost approach. The fair value of the intangibles using the income approach was determined with the following key assumptions: (a)a weighted average cost of capital of 13%, (b)long-term revenue decay rates ranging from 0% to 65%, and (c)royalty rates ranging from 0.5% to 8%. The fair value of the intangibles using the cost approach was based on amounts that would be required to replace the asset (i.e., replacement cost).    The Internally-developed franchises, Customer base, Developed software, and Trademark intangible assets will be amortized to  Cost of revenues - subscription, licensing, and other revenues - software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses,   Sales and marketing,   Cost of revenues - subscription, licensing, and other revenues - software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses,  and  General and administrative,  respectively. The intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits received.    The $2.7 billion of goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the benefits the Company expects to derive from accelerated expansion as an interactive entertainment provider in the mobile sector, future franchises, and technology, as well as the management team s proven ability to create future games and franchises. Approximately $620 million of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes in the U.S.    29           Contingent Liabilities Assumed    As a result of the King Acquisition, we assumed contingent liabilities related to contingent consideration associated with King s previous acquisitions of Nonstop Games Oy and Z2Live,Inc. The remaining contingent consideration for Non Stop Games Oy is linked to amounts generated from games launched by Nonstop Games Oy over a specified period. The range of the potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Company could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is from $0 to $84 million. The remaining contingent consideration for Z2Live,Inc. is linked to amounts generated from specific games launched by Z2Live,Inc. within a defined period. The potential range of undiscounted future payments that the Company could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is from $0 to $75 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement at the King Closing date and as of September30, 2016, for Nonstop Games Oy and Z2Live,Inc. was immaterial.    King Net Revenue and Earnings    The amount of net revenue and earnings attributable to King in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, are included in the table below. The amounts presented represent the net revenues and earnings after adjustments for purchase price accounting, inclusive of amortization of intangible assets, share-based payments, and deferral of revenues and related cost of revenues.       Pro Forma Financial Information    The unaudited financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations of the Company and King, on a pro forma basis, as though the acquisition had occurred on January1, 2015. The pro forma financial information presented includes the effects of adjustments related to amortization charges from acquired intangible assets, employee compensation from replacement equity awards issued in the King Acquisition and the profit sharing bonus plan established as part of the King Acquisition, and interest expense from the new debt, among other adjustments. We also adjusted for Activision Blizzard and King non-recurring acquisition related costs of approximately $69 million for the nine months ended September30, 2016. Non-recurring acquisition related costs for the three months ended September30, 2016 were not material. The pro forma financial information as presented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the King Acquisition, and any borrowings undertaken to finance the King Acquisition, had taken place at the beginning of the earliest period presented, nor does it intend to be a projection of future results.       30           15.   Recently issued accounting pronouncements    Recently adopted accounting pronouncements    Stock-based compensation    In June2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to stock compensation. The new standard requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award. This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered. We adopted this new standard as of January1, 2016, and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.    Consolidations    In February2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to consolidations. The new standard amends certain requirements for determining whether a variable interest entity must be consolidated. We adopted this new standard as of January1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.    Debt Issuance Costs    In April2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. The new standard requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. We adopted this change in accounting principle as of January1, 2016, and applied it retrospectively for each period presented. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.    Internal-Use Software    In April2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to internal-use software. The new standard relates to a customer s accounting for fees paid in cloud computing arrangements. The amendment provides guidance for customers to determine whether such arrangements include software licenses. If a cloud arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. We adopted this standard as of January1, 2016, and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.    Business Combinations    In September2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to business combinations. The new standard requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment, including the impact on prior periods, on provisional amounts recorded at the acquisition date as a result of the business combination be recognized in the reporting period the adjustment is identified. The standard also requires separate presentation on the face of the income statement, or disclosure in the notes, of the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item. Prior to the issuance of the standard, such adjustments to provisional amounts were recognized retrospectively. We adopted this new standard as of January1, 2016, and applied it prospectively. No measurement period adjustments impacting earnings occurred as of and for the nine months ended September30, 2016.    31           Share-Based Payments    In March2016, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify accounting for share-based payments. The new standard, amongst other things:       requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the statement of operations and that the tax effects of exercised or vested awards be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur;       requires excess tax benefits from share-based payments to be reported as operating activities on the statement of cash flows; and       permits an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate, as currently required, or account for forfeitures when they occur.    We elected to early adopt this new standard in the third quarter of 2016, which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of January1, 2016. As part of the adoption, we made certain elections, including the following:       to apply the presentation requirements for our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods presented; and       to continue to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate.    As a result of the adoption we recognized excess tax benefits of $12 million and $63 million as a reduction to income tax expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, respectively. The adoption of the standard impacted our previously reported quarterly results and financial positions for fiscal year 2016 as follows:             32           Given our retrospective application of the presentation requirements for our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows related to excess tax benefits, our net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in financing activities increased $33 million for the nine months ended September30, 2015. The other provisions of the standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.    Statement of Cash Flows    In August2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of certain cash items in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires, among other things, that cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities, as opposed to operating activities as is required under existing guidance. We elected to early adopt this standard in the current period and applied it retrospectively. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.    Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted    Revenue recognition    In May2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December15, 2017, and can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are evaluating the adoption method as well as the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements. While we are currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact of the new revenue standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we believe the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard may have a significant impact on the accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor-specific-objective-evidence( VSOE ) for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the current accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements is required. This requirement is eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly, we may be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software, as compared to the current requirement of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated offering period. While we are still currently evaluating the impact of the new standard, the impact of this identified difference in accounting may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.    33           Leases    In February2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either a operating or financing lease and lessees will need to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for their leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.    Inventory    In July2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to the measurement of inventory which requires inventory within the scope of the guidance to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2016 and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.    Financial Instruments    In January2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The new standard, amongst other things, generally requires companies to measure investments in other entities, except those accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The new standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2017, and the guidance should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity investments without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.    34

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    Business Overview    Activision Blizzard,Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment. The terms  Activision Blizzard,  the  Company,   we,   us,  and  our  are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard,Inc., and its subsidiaries.    Activision Blizzard is the result of the 2008 business combination ( Business Combination ) by and among the Company (then known as Activision,Inc.), Sego Merger Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision,Inc., VivendiS.A. ( Vivendi ), VGACLLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, and Vivendi Games,Inc. ( Vivendi Games ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of VGACLLC. As a result of the consummation of the Business Combination, Activision,Inc., was renamed Activision Blizzard,Inc.    As of December31, 2015, ASAC II LP, an exempted limited partnership established under the laws of the Cayman Islands ( ASAC LP ), held approximately 172 million shares, or approximately 23% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at that time. Robert A. Kotick, our Chief Executive Officer, and Brian G. Kelly, Chairman of our Board of Directors, are the managers of ASAC II LLC, the general partner of ASAC LP ( ASAC GP ). On June8, 2016, ASAC GP distributed the approximately 141 million shares allocable to the limited partners of ASAC LP to those limited partners. On July7, 2016, ASAC LP distributed approximately 18 million of its remaining approximately 31 million shares to ASAC GP. On August15, 2016, ASAC GP sold approximately 4 million shares of our common stock and distributed 14 million shares pro rata to its members, consisting of trusts for the benefit of Messrs.Kotick and Kelly, which shares were ultimately sold on that day for financial and estate-planning purposes. On August19, 2016, ASAC LP distributed its remaining shares of common stock to ASAC GP, leaving ASAC LP without any shares and ASAC GP with approximately 13 million shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 2% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of September30, 2016. We did not receive any proceeds fromany of the distributions or sales of the shares.    The common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol  ATVI.     The King Acquisition    On November2, 2015, we and King Digital Entertainment plc ( King ), a leading interactive mobile entertainment company ( King ), entered into a transaction agreement (the  Transaction Agreement ) under the terms of which we would acquire King (the  King Acquisition ) and King would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On February23, 2016 (the  King Closing Date ), we completed the King Acquisition under the terms of the Transaction Agreement and purchased all of the outstanding shares of King. The aggregate purchase price of King was approximately $5.8 billion, which was paid on the King Closing Date and funded with $3.6 billion of existing cash and $2.2 billion of cash from new debt issued by the Company. King s results of operations since the King Closing Date are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements.    We made this acquisition because we believe that the addition of King s highly-complementary mobile business positions the Company as a global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console, and PC platforms, as well as positioning us for future growth.    Reportable Segments    Based upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable operating segments: Activision Publishing,Inc., Blizzard Entertainment,Inc., and King Digital Entertainment Limited.    35           (i)Activision Publishing,Inc.    Activision Publishing,Inc. ( Activision ) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and content. Activision delivers content to a broad range of gamers, ranging from children to adults, and from core gamers to mass-market consumers, in a variety of geographies. Activision develops, markets, and sells products through retail channels or digital downloads, which are principally based on our internally-developed intellectual properties, including games in the Call of Duty   and Skylanders   franchises, as well as some licensed properties. Additionally, we have established a long-term alliance with Bungie to publish its game universe, Destiny. Activision currently offers games that operate on: the Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ) Xbox One ( Xbox One ) and Xbox 360 ( Xbox 360 ), Nintendo Co. Ltd. ( Nintendo ) Wii U ( Wii U ) and Wii ( Wii ), and Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. ( Sony ) PlayStation 4 ( PS4 ) and PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) console systems; the PC; the Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo Dual Screen, and Sony PlayStation Vita handheld game systems; and mobile and tablet devices.    (ii)Blizzard Entertainment,Inc.    Blizzard Entertainment,Inc. ( Blizzard ) is a leader in online PC gaming, including the subscription-based massively multi-player online role-playing game category, in terms of both subscriber base and revenues generated through its World of Warcraft   franchise. Blizzard also develops, markets, and sells role-playing action and strategy games for the PC, console, mobile, and tablet platforms, including games in the multiple-award winning Diablo  , StarCraft  , Hearthstone  : Heroes of Warcraft   , and Heroes of the Storm   franchises. On May 24, 2016, Blizzard added a new franchise, Overwatch  , a team-based first-person shooter available on the PC and console platforms. In addition, Blizzard maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Battle.net  , which facilitates digital distribution and online social connectivity across all Blizzard games. Blizzard distributes its products and generates revenues worldwide through various means, including subscriptions, sales of prepaid subscription cards, in-game purchases and services, retail sales of physical  boxed  products, online sales of downloadable PC products, purchases and downloads via third-party console, mobile, and tablet platforms, and licensing of software to third-party or related party companies that distribute Blizzard products.    (iii)King Digital Entertainment Limited    King Digital Entertainment Limited ( King ) is a leading interactive mobile entertainment company that develops and distributes games on mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS, and on online and social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King has four established free-to-play franchises: Candy Crush   , Farm Heroes   , Bubble Witch   , and Pet Rescue   , where monetization occurs through players purchasing virtual items and in-game virtual currency.    (iv)Other    We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:       The Major League Gaming ( MLG ) business (which we formerly referred to as Activision Blizzard Media Networks or Media Networks), which is devoted to eSports and builds on our competitive gaming efforts by creating ways to deliver best-in-class fan experiences across games, platforms, and geographies with a long-term strategy of monetization through advertising, sponsorships, tournaments, and premium content.       The Activision Blizzard Studios ( Studios ) business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our extensive library of iconic and globally-recognized intellectual properties.       The Activision Blizzard Distribution ( Distribution ) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistical, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.    36           Business Highlights    For the three months ended September30, 2016, Activision Blizzard had net revenues of $1.6 billion, as compared to net revenues of approximately $1.0 billion for the same period in 2015. For the three months ended September30, 2016, Activision Blizzard had earnings per diluted share of $0.26, as compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.17 for the same period in 2015.    For the nine months ended September30, 2016, Activision Blizzard had net revenues of $4.6 billion, as compared to net revenues of $3.3 billion for the same period in 2015. For the nine months ended September30, 2016, Activision Blizzard had earnings per diluted share of $0.94, as compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.98 for the same period in 2015.    Net revenues for the three months ended September30, 2016 include a net effect of $62 million from the deferral of net revenues. Net revenues for the nine months ended September30, 2016 include a net effect of $447 million from the recognition of deferred net revenues. Since certain games are hosted or include online functionality that represents an essential component of gameplay and, as a result, a more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable, we initially defer the software-related revenues from the sale and recognize the revenues attributable to these games over their estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year.    Also, for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, as a result of the King Acquisition, our net revenues include $447 million and $1,088 million, respectively, and our net income includes $(72) million and $(171) million from King s operations, respectively, after adjustments for purchase price accounting, inclusive of amortization of intangible assets, share-based payments, and deferral of revenues and related cost of revenues. Our earnings under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) are expected to be down versus prior-year as the expected results will be impacted by accounting charges associated with the King Acquisition, which include, among other things, integration and acquisition-related costs, the amortization of intangible assets resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments, share-based payments, and the related tax impact from the King Acquisition. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics or operating cash flows of our business, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP results.    On August23, 2016, we amended our Credit Agreement to refinance our term loans and revolver under the Credit Agreement. As a result of the amendment, we obtained $2.9 billion in proceeds in the form of a new tranche A term loan, of which the proceeds were used to pay-off our then outstanding term loans of $2.9 billion, which bore interest at higher rates. The refinancing resulted in a write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs attributed to the existing term loans of $10 million, with the remaining unamortized discount and financing costs being deferred along with new costs incurred with the amendment. Additionally, on September19, 2016, we issued two series of senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion in a private 144A offering, of which the proceeds were used to redeem our then existing 2021 Notes of $1.5 billion on October19, 2016 at a repayment price of $1.6 billion. The repayment resulted in a loss on extinguishment of approximately $82 million that was recognized in October2016, inclusive of prepayment premiums and the write-off of debt discount and deferred financing costs. As a result of the offering we incurred debt discount and financing costs of $17 million which were capitalized in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.    On February2, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per common share, payable on May11, 2016, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March30, 2016. On May11, 2016, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $192 million to such shareholders, and on May27, 2016, we made related dividend equivalent payments of $3 million to certain holders of restricted stock rights.    Activision Blizzard Recent and Upcoming Product Releases    We have recently released or expect to release the following titles and games, among other titles:       Activision released  Call of Duty: Black Ops III Descent , the third downloadable content pack for  Call of Duty: Black Ops III,  on the PS4 on July 12, 2016, and released it on Xbox One and PC on August 11, 2016.       Blizzard released the Summer Games event, a limited time event for Overwatch that included a soccer-like game mode and special seasonal cosmetic items , on August 2, 2016.        37              Blizzard released One Night in Karazhan   , a new adventure for Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft , on August 11, 2016.       Blizzard released World of Warcraft: Legion   , the sixth expansion for Blizzard s acclaimed massively multiplayer online role-playing game, on August 30, 2016.       Activision released  Call of Duty: Black Ops III Salvation , the fourth and final downloadable content pack for  Call of Duty: Black Ops III,  on the PS4 on September 6, 2016, and on Xbox One and PC on October 6, 2016.       Activision released Destiny: Rise of Iron , a large expansion in the Destiny universe, on September 20, 2016.       Blizzard released the Halloween Terror event, a limited time event for Overwatch that included a player versus environment game mode and special seasonal cosmetic items, on October 11, 2016.       Activision released Skylanders Imaginators , the next iteration in the Skylanders franchise, on October 16, 2016.       Activision expects to release Call of Duty  : Infinite Warfare    and Infinite Warfare Legacy Edition , featuring Modern Warfare  Remastered , on the PS4, Xbox One, and PC on November 4, 2016.    Monthly Active Users ( MAUs )    We monitor MAUs as a key measure of the overall size of our user base and its regular engagement with our portfolio of games. MAUs are the number of individuals who played a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period.An individual who plays two of our games would be counted as two users.In addition, due to technical limitations with respect to Activision and King MAUs, an individual who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users.For Blizzard MAUs, an individual who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user.    The number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may cause a temporary surge in MAUs. Accordingly, although we believe that overall trending in the number of MAUs can be a meaningful performance metric, period-to-period fluctuations may not be indicative of longer-term trends. The following table details our average MAUs on a sequential quarterly basis for our reportable segments (amounts in millions):       Average MAUs decreased by 9 million, or 2%, for the quarter ended September30, 2016, as compared to the quarter ended June30, 2016. The decrease in King s average MAUs is due to the performance of more mature titles, partially offset by the release of Farm Heroes Super Saga    in June 2016. The decrease in Activision s average MAUs is due to the timing of slate releases as Call of Duty: Black Ops III was launched in November 2015 and MAUs for a given title generally decline over time. The decrease is partially offset by the increase in Blizzard s average MAUs, driven by the release of Overwatch and World of Warcraft: Legion .    Average MAUs decreased by 66million, or 12%, for the quarter ended September30, 2016, as compared to the quarter ended September30, 2015. The decrease in King s average MAUs is due to the performance of more mature titles, partially offset by the release of new titles during the past twelve months, most notably Candy Crush Jelly Saga    and Farm Heroes Super Saga. This decrease is partially offset by the increase in Blizzard s average MAUs, driven by the release of Overwatch and World of Warcraft: Legion.    38           Management s Overview of Business Trends    Digital Online Channel Revenues    We provide our products through both retail and digital distribution channels. Many of our video games that are available through retailers as physical  boxed  software products are also available digitally, from our websites and from websites and digital distribution channels owned by third parties. In addition, we offer players digital downloadable content as add-ons to our products (e.g., new multi-player content packs or in-game microtransaction purchases), generally for a one-time fee. We also offer subscription-based services and other value-added services forWorld of Warcraft, all of which are digitally delivered and hosted by Battle.net.    We currently define sales via digital online channels as revenues from digitally-distributed subscriptions, licensing royalties, value-added services, downloadable content, microtransaction purchases, and products. This definition may differ from that used by our competitors or other companies.    According to Activision Blizzard internal estimates, overall industry digital gaming revenues for the nine months ended September30, 2016, increased by approximately 41% as compared to the same period in 2015, with mobile growth at 62%.The primary drivers of the increase in digital gaming revenues were increases in microtransaction purchases and consumer purchases of full games and other content via digital channels. In addition to increasing microtransaction purchases within free-to-play games, the increase includes microtransaction purchases within purchased game software, as publishers offer increasingly new opportunities for monetization within their games to extend and enlarge the monetization cycle. Digital revenues are an important part of our business, and we continue to focus on and develop products, such as downloadable content, that can be delivered via digital channels. The amount of our digital revenues in any period may fluctuate depending in part on the timing and nature of our specific product releases. Our sales of digital downloadable content are driven in part by sales of, and engagement by players in, our retail products. As such, lower revenues in our retail distribution channels in a year may impact our revenues through digital online channels in the subsequent year.    For the three months ended September30, 2016, revenues through digital online channels increased by $715 million, as compared to the same period in 2015, and represented 86% of our total consolidated net revenues, as compared to 64% for the same period in 2015. The digital online channel revenues for the three months ended September30, 2016 includes a net effect of $158 million deferral of net revenues.    For the nine months ended September30, 2016, revenues through digital online channels increased by $1,633 million, as compared to the same period in 2015, and represented 74% of our total consolidated net revenues, as compared to 54% for the same period in 2015. The digital online channel revenues for the nine months ended September30, 2016 include a net effect of $288 million deferral of net revenues.    Concentration of Top Titles    The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive software industry. According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 33% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2015. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games have been responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, the Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Skylanders, and Destiny franchises combined accounted for 71% of our consolidated net revenues, and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income, for 2015. As a result, successful competition against these titles can significantly impact our performance.    39           We are continually exploring additional investments in existing and future franchises. During 2015, we releasedHeroes of the Storm, Call of Duty Onlinein China, and on May24, 2016, we released Overwatch.    Additionally, on February23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition, diversifying our portfolio of key franchises and increasing our presence in the mobile market. We see similar concentration of key titles accounting for a disproportionate amount of digital sales in that market. According to the U.S. ranking for the Apple App Store, per App Annie Intelligence, seven mobile titles remained in the top 10 ranking of gross sales for all four quarters during 2015.    Overall, we expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industry s, revenues and profits in the near future.    Consolidated Statements of Operations Data    The following table sets forth condensed consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated in dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues, except for cost of revenues, which are presented as a percentage of associated revenues (amounts in millions):        (1)In periods prior to the second quarter of 2016, we presented cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations in four financial statement captions:  Cost of sales - product costs,    Cost of sales - online,   Cost of sales - software royalties and amortization,  and  Cost of sales - intellectual property licenses.  Commencing with the second quarter of 2016, we have revised the presentation in our condensed consolidated statements of operations to more clearly align our costs of revenues with the associated revenue captions as follows:    40           Cost of revenues - product sales:    (i)   Product costs  - includes the manufacturing cost of goods produced and sold. This generally includes product costs, manufacturing royalties, net of volume discounts, personnel-related costs, warehousing, and distribution costs. We generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned (typically in connection with the achievement of unit-based milestones).    (ii)   Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses  - includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties attributable to product sales revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released, at which time the capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable to product sales revenues.    Cost of revenues - subscription, licensing, and other revenues:    (i)   Game operations and distribution costs  - includes costs to operate our games, such as customer service, internet bandwidth and server costs, platform provider fees, and payment provider fees.    (ii)   Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses  - includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties attributable to subscription, licensing and other revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released, at which time the capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable to subscription, licensing, and other revenues.    Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.    Operating Segment Results    Our operating segments are consistent with our internal organizational structure, the manner in which our operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ), the manner in which we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments in determining and disclosing our reportable segments.    The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting, and fees and other expenses related to financings and acquisitions. The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly, no disclosure is made with respect thereto. Information on the operating segments and reconciliations of total segment net revenues and total segment operating income to consolidated net revenues from external customers and consolidated income before income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 are presented in the table below (amounts in millions):    41               (1)  Other segments includes other income and expenses from operating segments managed outside the reportable segments, including our MLG, Studios, and Distribution businesses. Other also includes unallocated corporate income and expenses.    (2)  Reflects fees and other expenses related to the King Acquisition, inclusive of related debt financings and integration costs.    Segment Net Revenues    Activision    Activision s net revenues decreased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to 2015. This was primarily due to:    42              Lower revenues from standalone toys and accessories from the Skylanders franchise. Additionally, Skylanders Imaginators was released in October 2016 while the comparable prior year title, Skylanders Superchargers , was released in September 2015.     Lower revenues from the Destiny franchise, as there were two expansion packs in 2015   House of Wolves and The Taken King   but only one in 2016   Rise of Iron .    The decrease was partially offset by:       Higher revenues from digital content associated with Call of Duty: Black Ops III as compared to  Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare .     Revenues from microtransactions from Destiny , which were introduced into the Destiny franchise in the fourth quarter of 2015.    Blizzard    Blizzard s net revenues increased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to 2015. This was primarily due to:       Revenues from Overwatch, a new team-based first-person shooter released in May 2016.     Higher revenues from World of Warcraft driven by the release of World of Warcraft: Legion  in August 2016, with no comparable release in 2015.    For the three months ended September30, 2016, as compared to 2015, the increase was partially offset by lower revenues from the Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft franchise due to the release of One Night in Karazhan, an adventure, in August2016 while the prior year comparable period included the release of The Grand Tournament   , an expansion which included higher priced offerings, in August 2015.    For the nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to 2015, the increase was partially offset by:       Lower revenues from Diablo III: Reaper of Souls    in China, which was released in the second quarter of 2015 with no comparable release in 2016.     Lower revenues from Heroes of the Storm .    King    King s net revenues represent the net revenues from the King Closing Date through September30, 2016. The revenues were primarily driven by the Candy Crush franchise, which included the release of Candy Crush Jelly Saga in January2016.    Segment Income from Operations    Activision    Activision s operating income remained flat for the three months ended September30, 2016, as compared to 2015, despite the decrease in revenues. This was primarily due to:       An increased percentage of revenues coming from higher margin online digital channels, driven by Call of Duty: Black Ops III .     Lower sales and marketing spending on Guitar Hero  Live and  the Destiny franchise.    43           Activision s operating income increased for the nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to 2015, despite the decrease in revenues. The increase was due to the same factors noted above for the three months ended September30, 2016, partially offset by increased product development costs.

Revenues recognized from King titles since the King Closing Date.     Revenues recognized from StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void    which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Meanwhile, World of Warcraft: Legion released in August2016 but the associated game revenues are largely deferred and will be recognized in future periods over an estimated service period.    50           Change in Deferred Revenues Recognized    Deferred revenues recognized from PC decreased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily due to deferrals of revenues associated with the release of World of Warcraft: Legion in August2016, as compared to the recognition of deferred revenues in 2015 from the release of World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor in November2014. The decrease is partially offset by higher deferred revenues recognized from Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft.    Additionally, for the three months ended September30, 2016, the decrease in deferred revenues was partially offset by the recognition of revenues associated with Overwatch. Conversely, for the nine months ended September30, 2016, the decrease in deferred revenues was also due to additional deferrals associated with Overwatch.    Mobile and ancillary    Net Revenues    Net revenues from mobile and ancillary increased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to 2015. This was primarily due to:       New revenues from King titles since the King Closing Date, which were primarily driven by the Candy Crush franchise.     Higher revenues recognized from Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, which was released on iPhone and Android smartphones in April 2015.    The increase was partially offset by lower revenues from standalone toys and accessories from the Skylanders franchise.

Change in Deferred Revenues Recognized    Deferred revenues recognized from mobile and ancillary had no significant movements for the three months ended September30, 2016, as compared to 2015.

Cost of Revenues - Product Sales    Product costs decreased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. This was primarily due to the release of Skylanders Superchargers in September2015, while the current year comparable title, Skylanders Imaginators, was released in October2016. The Skylanders franchise titles typically have relatively higher product costs compared to other titles due to the inclusion of various hardware components, including toys. This was partially offset by product costs incurred in the current periods associated with Overwatch, which was released in May2016, and Guitar Hero Live, which was released in October2015. Neither of these franchises had comparable titles impacting the three and nine months ended September30, 2015.    Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales decreased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016. This was primarily due to the timing of the Skylanders title launch in the current and prior year as noted above, along with lower software amortization from the Destiny franchise, asDestinywas released in the third quarter of 2014, but had no comparable full-game release in 2015. This was partially offset by software amortization from Overwatch, which was released in May2016 with no comparable title in 2015. Additionally, for the nine months ended September30, 2016, the decrease was further partially offset by higher software amortization associated with Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared toCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2014, and software amortization associated with recently released titles without prior comparable titles in the previous period, including Guitar Hero Live.    52           Cost of Revenues - Subscription, Licensing, and Other Revenues    Game operations and distribution costs increased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, when compared to the same periods in 2015. This was primarily due to increased online costs and platform provider fees associated with revenues included since the King Closing Date and increased expenditures to support our growing online activity across our existing and new titles.    Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues increased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, when compared to the same periods in 2015. This was primarily due to the amortization of internally-developed franchise intangible assets acquired in the King Acquisition. This was partially offset by lower software amortization from Heroes of the Storm, as it was released in June2015.    Product Development (amounts in millions)       Product development costs increased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to 2015. This was primarily due to:       Product development costs associated with King s titles.     Increased product development costs for Activision and Blizzard s current and upcoming releases.    Sales and Marketing (amounts in millions)       Sales and marketing costs increased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to 2015. This was primarily due to:       Amortization of the customer base intangible assets acquired in the King Acquisition.     Sales and marketing spending to support King s titles and new launches, including Farm Heroes Super Saga and Candy Crush Jelly Saga.     New sales and marketing spending to support Overwatch along with increased spending to support our existing franchises and their associated releases, including the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises. The month of September 2016 included our Call of Duty XP event, which culminated with the Call of Duty World League Championship.    These increases were partially offset by lower spending on Guitar Hero Live, the Destiny franchise, and the Skylanders franchise.    53           General and Administrative (amounts in millions)       General and administrative expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to 2015. This was primarily due to:       King s general and administrative costs, which are included from the King Closing Date.     Higher Blizzard personnel costs due to segment performance bonuses and increased headcount to support the business growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 2015.    Additionally, general and administrative expenses increased for the nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to 2015, due to higher professional and transaction related fees due to the King Acquisition, which closed on February23, 2016.    Interest and Other Expense (Income), Net (amounts in millions)       Interest and other expense (income), net, increased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to:       Interest expense associated with the existing Tranche A Term Loans that were funded at the King Closing Date.     Extinguishment costs associated with refinancing the existing Tranche A Term Loans and extinguishment of the Term Loan.    This increase was partially offset by lower interest expense related to the Term Loan as a result of having a lower principal balance during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016. We made voluntary prepayments of $500 million, $250 million, and $800 million on February25, 2016, March31, 2016, and May26, 2016, respectively.    Income Tax Expense (amounts in millions)       The Company accounts for its provision for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740,Income Taxes, which requires an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to be applied to the interim period, taking into account year-to-date amounts and projected results for the full year. The provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state, and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory U.S. income tax rate due to the effect of state and local income taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including, but not limited to: variations in the estimated and actual level of pre-tax income or loss by jurisdiction; changes in the mix of income by tax jurisdiction (as taxes are levied at relatively lower statutory rates in foreign regions and relatively higher statutory rates in the U.S.); research and development credits; changes in enacted tax laws and regulations, rulings, and interpretations thereof, including with respect to tax credits and state and local income taxes; developments in tax audits and other matters; and certain nondeductible expenses. Changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of the change.    54           The income tax expense of $32 million for the three months ended September30, 2016, reflects an effective tax rate of 14%, which is higher than the effective tax rate of 13% for the three months ended September30, 2015. The increase is due to the change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings and increases to the Company s reserve for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments (see  Recently issued accounting pronouncements ) and favorable return to provision adjustments.    The income tax expense of $93 million for the nine months ended September30, 2016, reflects an effective tax rate of 12%, which is lower than the effective tax rate of 20% for the nine months ended September30, 2015. The decrease is due to the change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings, the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, the net benefit related to the settlement of an income tax audit during the first quarter of 2016, and favorable return to provision adjustments, partially offset by increases to the Company s reserve for uncertain tax positions.    The effective tax rate of 14% for the three months ended September30, 2016 differs from the US statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to the tax benefit from foreign earnings taxed at relatively lower statutory rates, the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, the recognition of federal and California research and development credits, favorable return to provision adjustments, and increases to the Company s reserve for uncertain tax positions.    The effective tax rate of 12% for the nine months ended September30, 2016 differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to the tax benefit from foreign earnings taxed at relatively lower statutory rates, the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, the recognition of federal and California research and development credits, the net benefit related to the settlement of an income tax audit during the first quarter of 2016, favorable return to provision adjustments, and increases to the Company s reserve for uncertain tax positions.    The overall effective income tax rate for the year will be dependent in part on our profitability for the remainder of the year, as well as the other factors described above.    The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) is currently examining Activision Blizzard s federal tax returns for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax years. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company transitioned the review of its transfer pricing methodology from the advanced pricing agreement review process to the IRS examination team. Their review could result in a different allocation of profits and losses under the Company s transfer pricing agreements. Such allocation could have a positive or negative impact on our provision for uncertain tax positions for the period in which such a determination is reached and the relevant periods thereafter. In addition, as part of purchase price accounting for the King Acquisition, the Company assumed $93 million of uncertain tax positions primarily related to the transfer pricing on King tax years occurring prior to the King Acquisition. The Company is currently in negotiations with the relevant jurisdictions and taxing authorities, which could result in a different allocation of profits and losses between the relevant jurisdictions.    Vivendi Games  results for the period from January1, 2008 through July9, 2008 are included in the consolidated federal and certain foreign state and local income tax returns filed by Vivendi or its affiliates, while Vivendi Games  results for the period from July10, 2008 through December31, 2008 are included in the consolidated federal and certain foreign, state and local income tax returns filed by Activision Blizzard. IRS Appeals proceedings concerning Vivendi Games  tax return for the 2008 tax year were concluded during July2016, but that year remains open to examination by other major taxing authorities. The resolution of the 2008 IRS Appeals process did not have a material impact to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.    Certain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation or may be subject to examination or investigation by tax authorities in various jurisdictions, including France. These proceedings may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or provisions for uncertain tax positions. Such proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations in the period or periods in which the matters are resolved or in which appropriate tax provisions are taken into account in our financial statements. If we were to receive a materially adverse assessment from a taxing jurisdiction, we would plan to vigorously contest it and consider all of our options, including the pursuit of judicial remedies.    55           The final resolution of the Company s global tax disputes is uncertain. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of disputes, including the probability determination and estimation of the potential exposure. Based on current information, in the opinion of the Company s management, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, except as noted above. However, the Company s global tax disputes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in the period or periods in which the matters are ultimately resolved or in which appropriate tax provisions are taken into account in our financial statements.    In 2013, in connection with a share repurchase from Vivendi (the  Purchase Transaction ), we assumed certain tax attributes, generally consisting of net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards of approximately $760 million, which represent a potential future tax benefit of approximately $266 million. The utilization of such NOL carryforwards will be subject to certain annual limitations and will begin to expire in 2021. The Company also obtained indemnification from Vivendi against losses attributable to the disallowance of claimed utilization of such NOL carryforwards of up to $200 million in unrealized tax benefits in the aggregate, limited to taxable years ending on or prior to December31, 2016. No benefit for these tax attributes or indemnification was recorded upon the close of the Purchase Transaction. For the nine months ended September30, 2016, we utilized $291 million of the NOL, which resulted in a tax benefit of $102 million, and a corresponding reserve of $102 million was established. As of September30, 2016, an indemnification asset of $191 million has been recorded in  Other Assets,  and, correspondingly, the same amount has been recorded as a reduction to the consideration paid for the shares repurchased in  Treasury Stock.     Liquidity and Capital Resources    Sources of Liquidity (amounts in millions)          Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities    The primary drivers of cash flows provided by operating activities typically include the collection of customer receivables generated by the sale of our products and digital and subscription revenues, partially offset by: payments to vendors for the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of our products; payments for customer service support for our consumers; payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders; payments for interest on our debt; payments for software development; payments for tax liabilities; and payments to our workforce.    56           Cash flows provided by operating activities were higher for the nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. This is primarily due to:       New operating cash flows contributed by King.     Operating cash flows generated by the release of Overwatch and World of Warcraft: Legion during fiscal 2016, which had no comparable releases in the prior year, although the impact to net income is largely deferred into future periods.     Higher non-cash reconciling items, primarily due to the amortization of the acquired intangibles in the King Acquisition and associated deferred tax impacts.    Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities    The primary drivers of cash flows used in investing activities typically include the net effect of capital expenditures, changes in restricted cash balances, as well as cash used for acquisitions.    Cash flows used in investing activities were $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to $239 million for the nine months ended September30, 2015. The increase in the cash used was primarily due to the $2.2 billion cash outflow for the King Acquisition in excess of the cash already in escrow, net of the $1.15 billion cash acquired. This was partially offset by $144 million of cash outflow for the purchase of available-for-sale investments for the nine months ended September30, 2015 for which there was no such purchase made in fiscal 2016.    Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities    The primary drivers of cash flows used in financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt, and transactions involving our common stock, such as the issuance of shares of common stock to employees, the repurchase of our common stock, and the payment of dividends.    Cash flows provided by financing activities were higher during the nine months ended September30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to $6.9 billion of proceeds received from debt financings. These were partially offset by:       Repayments made to extinguish our Term Loan of $1.9 billion.     Repayments of $2.5 billion for refinancing our existing TLA.     Repayments of $185 million made on our new TLA, which included $167 million of voluntary prepayments, as compared to the $250 million partial repayment of our Term Loan in 2015.     Payment of debt discount and financing costs.     Higher payment of dividends of $195 million in 2016, compared to $170 million in 2015.    Other Liquidity and Capital Resources    Our primary sources of liquidity are typically cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities. In addition, as described below, we have availability of $250 million, subject to certain restrictions, under an unsecured revolving credit facility. With our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $4 billion at September30, 2016, and expected cash flows provided by operating activities, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet daily operations in the foreseeable future, including the repayment of $1.6 billion of our existing 2021 Notes made on October19, 2016. We also believe that we have sufficient working capital ($1.6 billion at September30, 2016) to finance our operational and financing requirements for at least the next twelve months, including: purchases of inventory and equipment; the development, production, marketing, and sale of new products; provision of customer service for our subscribers; acquisition of intellectual property rights for future products from third parties; and payments related to debt obligations.    57           As of September30, 2016, and December31, 2015, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $1.9 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively. If the cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. is needed in the future for our operations in the U.S., we would accrue and pay the required U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.    Debt    Credit Facilities    On October11, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) for a $2.5 billion secured term loan facility maturing in October2020 (the  Term Loan ), and a $250 million secured revolving credit facility (the  Original Revolver ). As of December31, 2015, as a result of repayments and prepayments during the prior periods, we had $1.9 billion outstanding under the Term Loan.    In conjunction with the King Acquisition, we entered into three amendments to the Credit Agreement (the  Amendments ). The Amendments, among other things, provided for incremental term loans in the form of trancheA term loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.3 billion. The proceeds were provided on February23, 2016 and were used to fund the King Acquisition. On March31, 2016, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Credit Agreement which provided for an incremental tranche A term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $250 million (together with the $2.3 billion tranche A term loans, the  Existing TLA ); the proceeds from the incremental borrowing were used to make a voluntary prepayment on our Term Loan on March31, 2016. In addition to this prepayment, we made voluntary prepayments on our Term Loan of $500 million and $800 million on February25 and May26, 2016, respectively.    On August23, 2016 we entered into a fifth amendment to the Credit Agreement (the  Fifth Amendment ) that provided for new tranche A term loans of approximately $2.9 billion (the  New TLA ) and an amended revolving credit facility of $250 million (the  Revolver  and together with the New TLA, the  Credit Facilities ). Both the New TLA and Revolver are scheduled to mature on August23, 2021 and are unsecured. The proceeds from the New TLA were primarily used to pay off the remaining outstanding principal balance on the Term Loan of $319 million and the Existing TLA of $2.5 billion. As a result of the payments to extinguish the Term Loan and Existing TLA, we wrote-off unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $10 million, which is included in  Interest and other expense (income), net  in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The remaining unamortized discount and deferred financing costs were deferred, along with new fees paid to the New TLA lenders, and will continue to be amortized over the maturity of the New TLA. Debt discounts and deferred financing costs incurred in relation to the Fifth Amendment were not material.    Borrowings under the Revolver may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed by the Company, and are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Up to $50 million of the Revolver may be used for letters of credit. To date, we have not drawn on the Revolver. Borrowings under the New TLA and the Revolver will bear interest, at the Company s option, at either (a)a base rate equal to the highest of (i)the federal funds rate, plus 0.5%, (ii)the prime commercial lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (iii)the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) for an interest period of one month beginning on such day plus 1.00%, or (b)LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable interest margin. LIBOR will be subject to a floor of 0% and the base rate will be subject to an effective floor of 1.00%. The applicable interest margin for borrowings under the New TLA and Revolver will range from 1.125% to 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings and from 0.125% to 1.00% for base rate borrowings and will be determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company s credit ratings. At September30, 2016, the New TLA bore interest at 1.77%.    The Credit Agreement requires quarterly principal payments of 0.625% of the stated principal amount of the New TLA commencing on September30, 2016, with increases to 1.250% starting on September30, 2019 and 3.125% starting on September30, 2020, with the remaining balance payable on the New TLA s scheduled maturity date of August23, 2021. On September30, 2016, in addition to the required quarterly repayment of $18 million, we made a voluntary prepayment on our New TLA of $167 million. These payments satisfied the required quarterly principal repayments through December31, 2018.    58           The Company is subject to a financial covenant requiring the Company s Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not to exceed (i)4.00:1.00 on or prior to March31, 2017, and (ii)thereafter, 3.50:1.00. The Fifth Amendment contains other covenants consistent with the Credit Agreement, although the Fifth Amendment provides for additional exceptions from such covenants that are customary for transactions of this type for issuers with similar credit ratings. A violation of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of such event of default or certain other customary events of default, payment of any outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated, and the lenders  commitments to extend credit under the Credit Agreement may be terminated. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement could, under certain circumstances, permit the holders of other outstanding unsecured debt, including the debt holders described below, to accelerate the repayment of such obligations. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the Credit Facilities as of September30, 2016.    The Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain of the Company s U.S. subsidiaries, whose assets represent approximately 68% of our consolidated total assets.    Unsecured Senior Notes    On September19, 2013, we issued, at par, $1.5 billion of 5.625% unsecured senior notes due September2021 (the  Original 2021 Notes ) and $750 million of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due September2023 (the  2023 Notes  and, together with the Original 2021 Notes, the  Notes ). On September19, 2016, we issued $650 million of 2.300% unsecured senior notes due September2021 (the  New 2021 Notes ) and $850 million of 3.400% unsecured senior notes due September2026 (the  2026 Notes  and together with the New 2021 Notes, the  New Notes ) in a private offering made in accordance with Rule144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.    In connection with the issuance of the New Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the  Registration Rights Agreement ), among the Company, the Guarantors and the representatives of the initial purchasers of the New Notes. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to within one year of the issue date of the New Notes, among other things, (1)file a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange each series of the New Notes for new notes that are substantially identical in all material respects, (except for the provisions relating to the transfer restrictions and payment of additional interest) and (2)cause the registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act.    Interest on the Notes and New Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March15 and September15 of each year, commencing on March15, 2014 and March15, 2017, respectively. As of September30, 2016, the Notes and New Notes had a net carrying value of $2.22 billion and $1.48 billion, respectively.    The Original 2021 Notes became eligible for redemption on September15, 2016 (and, as described below, were redeemed on October19, 2016). We may redeem the 2023 Notes on or after September15, 2018, in whole or in part on any one or more occasions, at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of the 2023 Notes prior to September15, 2018, at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a  make-whole premium  and accrued and unpaid interest. Further, upon the occurrence of one or more qualified equity offerings, we may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes outstanding with the net cash proceeds from such offerings.    We may redeem the New 2021 Notes on or after August15, 2021, and the 2026 Notes on or after June15, 2026, in whole or in part on any one or more occasions and in each case at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of the New 2021 Notes prior to August15, 2021 and some or all of the 2026 Notes prior to June15, 2026, in each case at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a  make-whole  premium and accrued and unpaid interest. Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes and New Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.    The Notes contain customary covenants that place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of debt, granting of liens, payment of dividends, sales of assets, and certain merger and consolidation transactions. The New Notes contain customary covenants that place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of secured debt, entry into sale or leaseback transactions, and certain merger or consolidation transactions. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the Notes and New Notes as of September30, 2016.    59           On September19, 2016 we issued an irrevocable notice to the holders of the Original 2021 Notes that we were calling those notes which then had a 30-day period before payment. On October19, 2016, we redeemed the notes in full for $1.6 billion, which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of approximately $82 million, comprised of a premium payment of $63 million and write off of unamortized discount and financing costs of $19 million. This loss was recognized at the time of extinguishment. As a result of the irrevocable notice of redemption, we presented the outstanding principal balance of the Original 2021 Notes and its related unamortized discount and deferred financing costs as  Current portion of long-term debt, net  on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September30, 2016.    Debt Discounts and Deferred Financing Costs    Fees and discounts associated with the closing of our debt instruments are recorded as debt discount, which reduces their respective carrying values, and is amortized over their respective terms. Amortization expense is recorded within  Interest and other expense (income), net  in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.    In connection with the debt financing for the Existing TLA and New Notes offering, we incurred $38 million and $17 million of discounts and financing costs, respectively, that were capitalized and recorded within  Long-term debt, net  in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. New lender fees and deferred financing costs related to the New TLA were not material.    Debt Repayments    On February2, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized debt repayments of up to $1.5 billion of our outstanding debt during 2016. For the nine months ended September30, 2016, we have made payments to reduce our total outstanding term loans by $1.5billion.    Capital Expenditures    For the year ending December31, 2016, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $151 million, primarily for computer hardware and software purchases. During the first nine months of 2016, we made aggregate capital expenditures of $99million.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    At September30, 2016, and December31, 2015, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, often referred to as  structured finance  or  special purpose  entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.    60           Financial Disclosure    We maintain internal control over financial reporting, which generally includes those controls relating to the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S.GAAP. We also are focused on our  disclosure controls and procedures,  which as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), are generally those controls and procedures designed to ensure that financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC is reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rulesand forms, and that such information is communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.    Our Disclosure Committee, which operates under the Board of Directors-approved Disclosure Committee Charter and Disclosure Controls& Procedures Policy, includes senior management representatives and assists executive management in its oversight of the accuracy and timeliness of our disclosures, as well as in implementing and evaluating our overall disclosure process. As part of our disclosure process, senior finance and operational representatives from all of our corporate divisions and business units prepare quarterly reports regarding their current-quarter operational performance, future trends, subsequent events, internal controls, changes in internal controls, and other accounting and disclosure relevant information. These quarterly reports are reviewed by certain key corporate finance executives. These corporate finance representatives also conduct quarterly interviews on a rotating basis with the preparers of selected quarterly reports. The results of the quarterly reports and related interviews are reviewed by the Disclosure Committee. Finance representatives also conduct interviews with our senior management team, our legal counsel and other appropriate personnel involved in the disclosure process, as appropriate. Additionally, senior finance and operational representatives provide internal certifications regarding the accuracy of information they provide that is utilized in the preparation of our periodic public reports filed with the SEC. Financial results and other financial information also are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. As required by applicable regulatory requirements, the principal executive and financial officers review and make various certifications regarding the accuracy of our periodic public reports filed with the SEC, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting. With the assistance of the Disclosure Committee, we will continue to assess and monitor, and make refinements to, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting.    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments, or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions, and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, include the following:       Revenue Recognition including Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables     Allowances for Returns, Price Protection, Doubtful Accounts, and Inventory Obsolescence     Software Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses     Income Taxes     Fair Value Estimates (including Business Combinations and Assessment of Impairment of Assets)     Stock-Based Compensation    During the nine months ended September30, 2016, there were no significant changes to the above critical accounting policies and estimates, but we did expand the accounting policy disclosure for revenue recognition to include virtual currency as noted below. Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in PartII,Item7 of our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2015, for a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.    61           Microtransaction Revenues    Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual goods and currencies to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods and currencies are initially recorded in deferred revenues. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as a player uses the virtual goods purchased with the virtual currency. We categorize our virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time. We recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player, which is generally the estimated service period of the game.    Recently issued accounting pronouncements    Recently adopted accounting pronouncements    Stock-based compensation    In June2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to stock compensation. The new standard requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award. This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered. We adopted this new standard as of January1, 2016, and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.    Consolidations    In February2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to consolidations. The new standard amends certain requirements for determining whether a variable interest entity must be consolidated. We adopted this new standard as of January1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.    Debt Issuance Costs    In April2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. The new standard requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. We adopted this change in accounting principle as of January1, 2016, and applied it retrospectively for each period presented. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.    Internal-Use Software    In April2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to internal-use software. The new standard relates to a customer s accounting for fees paid in cloud computing arrangements. The amendment provides guidance for customers to determine whether such arrangements include software licenses. If a cloud arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. We adopted this standard as of January1, 2016, and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.    Business Combinations    In September2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to business combinations. The new standard requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment, including the impact on prior periods, on provisional amounts recorded at the acquisition date as a result of the business combination be recognized in the reporting period the adjustment is identified. The standard also requires separate presentation on the face of the income statement, or disclosure in the notes, of the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item. Prior to the issuance of the standard, such adjustments to provisional amounts were recognized retrospectively. We adopted this new standard as of January1, 2016, and applied it prospectively. No measurement period adjustments impacting earnings occurred as of and for the nine months ended September30, 2016.    62           Share-Based Payments    In March2016, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify accounting for share-based payments. The new standard, amongst other things:       requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the statement of operations and that the tax effects of exercised or vested awards be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur;       requires excess tax benefits from share-based payments to be reported as operating activities on the statement of cash flows; and       permits an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate, as currently required, or account for forfeitures when they occur.    We elected to early adopt this new standard in the third quarter of 2016, which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of January1, 2016. As part of the adoption, we made certain elections, including the following:       to apply the presentation requirements for our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods presented; and       to continue to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate.    As a result of the adoption we recognized excess tax benefits of $12 million and $63 million as a reduction to income tax expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016, respectively. The adoption of the standard impacted our previously reported quarterly results and financial positions for fiscal year 2016 as follows:          63           Given our retrospective application of the presentation requirements for our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows related to excess tax benefits, our net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in financing activities increased $33 million for the nine months ended September30, 2015. The other provisions of the standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.    Statement of Cash Flows    In August2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of certain cash items in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires, among other things, that cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities, as opposed to operating activities as is required under existing guidance. We elected to early adopt this standard in the current period and applied it retrospectively. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.    Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted    Revenue recognition    In May2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December15, 2017, and can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are evaluating the adoption method as well as the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements. While we are currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact of the new revenue standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we believe the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard may have a significant impact on the accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor-specific-objective-evidence( VSOE ) for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the current accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements is required. This requirement is eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly, we may be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software, as compared to the current requirement of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated offering period. While we are still currently evaluating the impact of the new standard, the impact of this identified difference in accounting may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.    Leases    In February2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, amongst other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either a operating or financing lease and lessees will need to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for their leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.    64           Inventory    In July2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to the measurement of inventory which requires inventory within the scope of the guidance to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2016 and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.    Financial Instruments    In January2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The new standard, amongst other things, generally requires companies to measure investments in other entities, except those accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The new standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2017, and the guidance should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity investments without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.
