Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company or AMD) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The results of operations for the quarter and six months ended July 1, 2017 shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year ending December30, 2017 . In the opinion of the Company's management, the information contained herein reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2016 . The Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. The quarters and six months ended July1, 2017 and June25, 2016 each consisted of 13 weeks and 26 weeks, respectively. Principles of Consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the Company's accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all significant inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Inventory. In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (ASU 2015-11), which requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost or net realizable value test. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2017 and it did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Investments . In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting (ASU 2016-07), whichrequires the equity method investor to add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment qualifies for equity method accounting. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2017 and it did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Stock Compensation. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2017 and elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $96 million cumulative-effect adjustment in accumulated deficit and an offsetting increase in deferred tax assets for previously unrecognized excess tax benefits that existed as of December 31, 2016. Since substantially all of the Company's U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, are subject to a valuation allowance and the realization of these assets is not more likely than not to be achieved, the Company recorded a $96 million valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets with an offsetting adjustment in accumulated deficit. The Company elected to report cash flows related to excess tax benefits as an operating activity on a prospective basis. The presentation requirement for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares did not impact the statements of cash flows because such cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Revenue Recognition. InMay 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09), which creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies in all industries and replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has issued several amendments to the new standard, including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The new standard permits companies to early adopt the new standard, but not before annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The 7 Company will not early adopt the new standard and therefore the new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of its fiscal 2018. The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or prospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application and providing additional disclosures comparing results to the previous rules in the year of adoption of the new standard (the modified retrospective method or the cumulative catchup method). The Company currently anticipates adopting the standard using the full retrospectivemethod to restate each prior reporting period presented. The Company's ability to adopt utilizing the full retrospective method is dependent upon system readiness and the completion of its analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements. In 2016, the Company established a cross-functional team consisting of representatives across both business segments.While the Company is continuingto assess all potential impacts of the standard, it currently believes the mostsignificant impact relates to accelerated revenue recognition for sales to its distributors, whereby revenue is expected to be recognized upon the initial sale to the Company's distributors, instead of the current recognition upon resale by the distributors to the end customers. The Company currently expects other revenue streams to remain substantially unchanged. Aspart of the Company's assessment and implementation plan, the Company is evaluating and implementing changes to its policies, procedures and controls. Financial Instruments. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01), which requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Entities will have to assess the realizability of such deferred tax assets in combination with the entities' other deferred tax assets. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2016-01 on its consolidated financial statements. Leases. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (ASU 2016-02), which increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, lessees must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. Financial Instruments . In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13). The standard changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the timing of adoption and impact of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements. Statement of Cash Flows . In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15), whichis intended to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes . In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. This amends current GAAP which prohibits recognition of current and deferred income taxes for all types of intra-entity asset transfers until the asset has been sold to an outside party. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the Company must apply a modified retrospective transition approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements, as well as its planned adoption date. 8 Goodwill Impairment. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other : Topic 350: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04), which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under the amendments in ASU 2017-04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual and any interim impairment tests performed for periods beginning after December 15, 2019 on a prospective basis, and earlier adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2017-04 on its consolidated financial statements. Stock Compensation.  In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation: Topic 718: Scope of Modification Accounting (ASU 2017-09) to provide clarity and reduce both the (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when changing the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards. Under ASU 2017-09, modification accounting is required to be applied unless all of the following are the same immediately before and after the change: 1.The award's fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if those measurement methods are used). 2.The award's vesting conditions. 3.The award's classification as an equity or liability instrument. ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. The Company has evaluated the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2017-09 and does not expect that this guidance will have a significant impact on its financial statements. Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB, which the Company has adopted or will adopt, as applicable, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or operating results. NOTE 2. GLOBALFOUNDRIES Wafer Supply Agreement. The Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) governs the terms by which the Company purchases products manufactured by GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF). Sixth Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement . On August 30, 2016, the Company entered into a sixth amendment (the Sixth Amendment) to the WSA. The Sixth Amendment modified certain terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for the Company's microprocessor, graphics processor and semi-custom products for a five -year period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020. The Company and GF also agreed to establish a comprehensive framework for technology collaboration for the 7nm technology node. The Sixth Amendment also provides the Company a limited waiver with rights to contract with another wafer foundry with respect to certain products in the 14nm and 7nm technology nodes and gives the Company greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services across its product portfolio. In consideration for these rights, the Company agreed to pay GF $100 million in installments starting in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 through the third fiscal quarter of 2017. During the second fiscal quarter of 2017, the Company paid GF $25 million and, as of July1, 2017 , the Company had paid GF $75 million in aggregate. Starting in 2017 and continuing through 2020, the Company also agreed to make quarterly payments to GF based on the volume of certain wafers purchased from another wafer foundry. Further, for each calendar year during the term of the Sixth Amendment, the Company and GF agreed to annual wafer purchase targets that increase from 2016 through 2020. If the Company does not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any calendar year, the Company will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the Company's actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. The annual targets were established based on the Company's business and market expectations and took into account the limited waiver it received for certain products. As of July1, 2017 , the Company expected to meet its 2017 wafer purchase target. The Company and GF also agreed on fixed pricing for wafers purchased during 2016 and established a framework to agree on annual wafer pricing for the years 2017 to 2020. The Company and GF have agreed on pricing for wafer purchases for 2017. The Company's total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing, research and development activities and other for the quarters ended July1, 2017 and June25, 2016 were $266 million and $85 million , respectively. The Company's total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing, research and development activities and other for the six months ended July 1, 2017 and June25, 2016 were $442 million and $293 million , respectively. As of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 , the amount of prepayment and other receivables related to GF was $7 million and $32 million , respectively, included in Prepayment and other receivables - related parties on its condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 , the amount 9  payable to GF was $229 million and $255 million , respectively, included in Payables to related parties on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. Warrant Agreement . Also on August 30, 2016, in consideration for the limited waiver and rights under the Sixth Amendment, the Company entered into a warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement) with West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala). Under the Warrant Agreement, WCH and its permitted assigns are entitled to purchase 75 million shares of the Company's common stock (the Warrant Shares) at a purchase price of $5.98 per share. The warrant is exercisable in whole or in part until February 29, 2020, provided that the maximum number of Warrant Shares that may be exercised prior to the one-year anniversary of the Warrant Agreement cannot exceed 50 million . The warrant will be fully exercisable as of August 30, 2017. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Warrant Agreement will only be exercisable to the extent that Mubadala does not beneficially own, either directly through any other entities directly and indirectly owned by Mubadala or its subsidiaries, an aggregate of more than 19.99% of the Company's outstanding capital stock after any such exercise. GF continues to be a related party of the Company because Mubadala and Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech, a party to the WSA) are affiliated with WCH, the Company's largest stockholder. GF, WCH and Mubadala Tech are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mubadala. NOTE 3. Supplemental Balance Sheet Information Accounts Receivable, net As of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016, Accounts receivables, net included unbilled accounts receivables of $45 million and $37 million , respectively.Unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue recognized but not billed as payments are deferred by customers until certain contractual milestones are met. Substantially all unbilled accounts receivable are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months. Inventories Property, Plant and Equipment 10  The Company incurs costs for the fabrication of masks used by its foundry partners to manufacture its products. Beginning the first fiscal quarter of 2017, the Company capitalizes mask costs that are expected to be utilized in production manufacturing as the Company's product development process has become more predictable and thus supports capitalization of the mask. The capitalized mask costs begin depreciating to Cost of Sales once the products go into production, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of two years. Previously mask sets were expensed to research and development. Other Assets Accrued Liabilities NOTE 4. Equity Interest Purchase Agreement - ATMP Joint Venture On April 29, 2016, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries completed the sale of a majority of the equity interests in Suzhou TF-AMD Semiconductor Co., Ltd. (formerly, AMD Technologies (China) Co., Ltd.), and TF AMD Microelectronics (Penang) Sdn. Bhd. (formerly, Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd.), to affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. (formerly, Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd.) (TFME), a Chinese joint stock company, to form two joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JV). As a result of the sale, TFME's affiliates own 85% of the equity interests in the ATMP JV while certain of the Company's subsidiaries own the remaining 15% . The Company has no obligation to fund the ATMP JV. The Company accounts for its equity interests in the ATMP JV under the equity method of accounting due to its significant influence over the ATMP JV. As of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 , the carrying value of the Company's investment in the ATMP JV was approximately $58 million and $59 million , respectively. Following the deconsolidation, the ATMP JV is a related party of the Company. The ATMP JV provides assembly, test, mark and packaging (ATMP) services to the Company. The Company currently pays the ATMP JV for ATMP services on a cost-plus basis. The Company's total purchases from the ATMP JV during the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 amounted to approximately $105 million and $201 million , respectively. The Company's total purchases from the ATMP JV during the three and six months ended June 25, 2016 amounted to approximately $66 million . As of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 , the amount payable to the ATMP JV was $145 million and $128 million , respectively, included in Payables to related parties on its condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 , the Company recorded $3 million and $5 million , respectively, in Equity loss in investee on its condensed consolidated statements of operations, which included certain expenses incurred by the Company on behalf of the ATMP JV. During the three and six months ended June 25, 2016 , the Company recorded a loss of $3 million , in Equity loss in investee on its condensed consolidated statements of operations, which included certain expenses incurred by the Company on behalf of the ATMP JV. NOTE 5. Equity Joint Venture - Intellectual Property Licensing Agreement  In February 2016, the Company and Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity (JV Partner), formed a joint venture comprised of two separate legal entities, China JV1 and China JV2 (collectively, the THATIC JV). The Company's equity share in China JV1 and China JV2 is a majority and minority interest, respectively, funded 11  by the Company's contribution of certain of its patents. The JV Partner is responsible for the initial and on-going financing of the THATIC JV's operations. The Company has no obligations to fund the THATIC JV. The Company concluded the China JV1 and China JV2 are not operating joint ventures and are variable interest entities due to their reliance on on-going financing by JV Partner. The Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of either China JV1 or China JV2, as the Company does not have unilateral power to direct selling and marketing, manufacturing and product development activities related to the THATIC JV's products. Accordingly, the Company will not consolidate either of these entities and therefore accounts for its investments in the THATIC JV under the equity method of accounting. The THATIC JV is a related party of the Company. In February 2016, the Company licensed certain of its intellectual property (Licensed IP) to the THATIC JV for a total of approximately $293 million in license fee payable over several years contingent upon achievement of certain milestones. The Company also expects to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV's products to be developed on the basis of such Licensed IP. The Company will also provide certain engineering and technical support to the THATIC JV in connection with the product development. In March 2017, the Company entered into a development and intellectual property agreement with THATIC JV, and also expects to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV's products to be developed on the basis of such agreement. The Company will also provide certain engineering and technical support to the THATIC JV in connection with the product development. The Company recognizes income related to the Licensed IP over the period commencing upon delivery of the first Licensed IP milestone through the date of the milestone that requires the Company's continuing involvement in the product development process. Royalty payments will be recognized in income once earned. The Company will classify Licensed IP income and royalty income as other operating income. During the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 , the Company recognized $25 million and $52 million licensing gain associated with the Licensed IP, respectively, and development fees of $6 million and $10 million , respectively, as a credit to research and development expenses. During the three and six months ended June 25, 2016 , the Company recognized $26 million and $33 million licensing gain, respectively. No development fee credit associated with these agreements was recognized by the Company during the three and six months ended June 25, 2016 . No royalty income was recognized by the Company during the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 and June25, 2016 . The Company's total exposure to losses through its investment in the THATIC JV is limited to the Company's investment in the THATIC JV, which was zero as of July1, 2017 . The Company's share in the net losses of the THATIC JV for the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 and June25, 2016 was not material and is not recorded in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations since the Company is not obligated to fund the THATIC JV's losses in excess of the Company's investment in the THATIC JV. The Company's receivable from THATIC JV was $2 million and zero as of July1, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, included in Prepayment and other receivables - related parties on its condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of July1, 2017 , the total assets and liabilities of the THATIC JV were not material. NOTE 6. Debt and Secured Revolving Line of Credit Debt 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 On September 14, 2016, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ( 2.125% Notes). The Company also granted an option to the underwriters to purchase an additional $105 million aggregate principal amount of the 2.125% Notes. On September 28, 2016, this option was exercised in full and the Company issued an additional $105 million aggregate principal amount of the 2.125% Notes. The 2.125% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company and will mature on September 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. Interest is payable in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on March 1, 2017. The 2.125% Notes are governed by the terms of a base indenture and a supplemental indenture (together the 2.125% Indentures) dated September 14, 2016 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2026 under the occurrence of one of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate 12  on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after June 1, 2026 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, at the Company's election. The first event described in (1) above was met during the second quarter of 2017 and as a result, the 2.125% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder as of July 1, 2017 and remain convertible until September 30, 2017. The Company's current intent is to deliver shares of its common stock upon conversion of the 2.125% Notes. As such, the Company continued to classify the carrying value of the liability component of the 2.125% Notes as long-term debt and the equity component of the 2.125% Notes as permanent equity on its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of July 1, 2017. The Company may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the 2.125% Notes. The conversion rate is currently 125.0031 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2.125% Notes(equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.00 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances. If the Company undergoes a fundamental change prior to the maturity date of the notes, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2.125% Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2.125% Notes to be repurchased,plusaccrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In accounting for the issuance of the 2.125% Notes, the Company separated the 2.125% Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amounts of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have associated conversion features. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2.125% Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its book value (debt discount) is accreted to interest expense over the term of the 2.125% Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the 2.125% Notes, the Company allocated the total amount of issuance costs incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative fair values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2.125% Notes, and the issuance costs attributable to the equity component were netted against the equity component in  additional paid-in capital. During 2016, the Company recorded issuance costs of $15 million and $9 million , for the liability and equity portions, respectively. The determination of whether or not the 2.125% Notes are convertible must continue to be performed on a calendar-quarter basis. The 2.125% Notes consisted of the following: (1) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within Long-term debt, net and amortized over the remaining life of the notes using the effective interest rate method. (2) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within additional paid-in capital, net of $9 million of equity issuance costs. As of July1, 2017 , the remaining life of the 2.125% Notes was approximately 111 months . Based on the closing price of the Company's common stock of $12.48 on June 30, 2017, the last business day of the second quarter of 2017 , the if-converted value of the 2.125% Notes exceeded its principal amount by approximately $451 million . 13  The effective interest rate of the liability component of the 2.125% Notes is 8% . This interest rate was based on the interest rates of similar liabilities at the time of issuance that did not have associated conversion features. The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the 2.125% Notes: 6.75% Senior Notes Due 2019 On February26, 2014, the Company issued $600 million of its 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 ( 6.75% Notes). The 6.75% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. Interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning September 1, 2014 until the maturity date of March1, 2019. The 6.75% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 6.75% Indenture) dated February 26, 2014 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. On February 10, 2017, the Company settled $5 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.75% Notes with treasury stock. As of July1, 2017 , the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 6.75% Notes was $191 million . 7.50% Senior Notes Due 2022 On August15, 2012, the Company issued $500 million of its 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 ( 7.50% Notes). The 7.50% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. Interest is payable on February15 and August15 of each year beginning February15, 2013 until the maturity date of August15, 2022.

Secured Revolving Line of Credit  Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement  On April14, 2015, the Company and its subsidiaries, AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd. (AMDISS) and ATI Technologies ULC (collectively, the Loan Parties), entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement (the Amended 14  and Restated Loan Agreement) by and among the Loan Parties, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as lenders (the Lenders) and Bank of America, N.A., acting as agent for the Lenders (the Agent).  Fifth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement  On March 21, 2017, the Loan Parties entered into a fifth amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the Fifth Amendment) by and among the Loan Parties, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as lenders and the Agent, which modifies the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The Fifth Amendment amends the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement by, among other things, extending the maturity date of the Secured Revolving Line of Credit from April 14, 2020 to March 21, 2022, reducing the Applicable Margin (as defined in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement), reducing the commitment fee, lowering the minimum threshold of Availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) required to be maintained by the Company and AMDISS in order to avoid cash dominion, amending the borrowing base reporting requirement, amending maximum dollar limits related to supply chain finance arrangements, and reducing the amount of the Secured Revolving Line of Credit available for the issuance for letters of credit from $75 million to $45 million .  The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement provides for a Secured Revolving Line of Credit for a principal amount up to $500 million with up to $45 million available for issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit are limited to up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable ( 90% for certain qualified eligible accounts receivable), minus specified reserves. The size of the commitments under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be increased by up to an aggregate amount of $200 million .  The Secured Revolving Line of Credit is secured by a first priority security interest in the Loan Parties' accounts receivable, inventory, deposit accounts maintained with the Agent and other specified assets, including books and records. As of July1, 2017 , the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had an outstanding loan balance of $42 million , at an interest rate of 4.75% . As of December31, 2016 , the Company did no t have any borrowings outstanding under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit. As of July1, 2017 , the Company had $19 million letter of credit outstanding and up to $249 million available for future borrowings under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The Company reports its intra-period changes in its revolving credit balance on a net basis in its condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as the Company intends the period of the borrowings to be brief, repaying borrowed amounts within 90 days . As of July1, 2017 , the Company was in compliance with all required covenants in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. NOTE 7. Net Income (Loss) Per Share Basic net income (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus any potentially dilutive shares outstanding. Potentially dilutive shares include stock options, restricted stock units, shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.125% Notes and the exercise of the warrant under the Warrant Agreement. 15  The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share: Potential sharesfrom stock options, restricted stock units, the 2.125% Notes and the warrants under the Warrant Agreement totaling 193 million for the second quarter of 2017 and potential shares from stock options and restricted stock units totaling 19 million for the second quarter of 2016 were not included in the net income (loss) per share calculations because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. Potential sharesfrom stock options, restricted stock units, the 2.125% Notes and the warrants under the Warrant Agreement totaling 196 million for the six months ended July 1, 2017 and potential shares from stock options and restricted stock units totaling 41 million for the six months ended June 25, 2016 were not included in the net loss per share calculations because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. NOTE 8.Financial Instruments Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash and financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 are summarized below: 16 (1) The Company did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level2 of the fair value hierarchy during the quarter and six months ended July 1, 2017 or the year ended December31, 2016 . (2) The Company's Level 1 assets are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. (3) The Company's Level 2 assets are valued using broker reports that utilize quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments. Brokers gather observable inputs for all of the Company's fixed income securities from a variety of industry data providers and other third-party sources. Available-for-sale securities held by the Company as of July1, 2017 consisted of commercial paper. The amortized cost of available-for-sale securities approximates the fair value for all periods presented. In addition to those amounts presented above, as of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 , the Company had approximately $2 million of investments in government money market funds, used as collateral for letters of credit deposits, which were included in Other current assets on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. These government money market funds are classified within Level 1 because they are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Their amortized cost approximates the fair value for all periods presented. The Company is restricted from accessing these deposits. As of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 , the Company also had approximately $16 million and $15 million , respectively, of investments in mutual funds held in a Rabbi trust established for the Company's deferred compensation plan, which were included in Other assets on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. These mutual funds are classified within Level 1 because they are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Their amortized cost approximates the fair value for all periods presented. The Company is restricted from accessing these investments. Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis. The Company carries its financial instruments at fair value with the exception of its debt. Financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis for disclosure purposes. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments not recorded at fair value are as follows:  (1)  Carrying amounts of long-term debt are net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $22 million as of July1, 2017 and $25 million as of December31, 2016 , based on the adoption of ASU 2015-03 and net of unamortized debt discount associated with the 2.125% Notes of $297 million as of July1, 2017 and $308 million as of December31, 2016 . The Company's long-term debt is classified within Level 2. The fair value of the debt was estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. The fair value of the Company's accounts receivable, accounts payable and other short-term obligations approximate their carrying value based on existing payment terms. 17 Hedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges The following table shows the amount of gain (loss) included in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) and the amount of gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) and included in earnings related to the foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges: The Company's foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 because the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments in active markets, such as currency spot and forward rates. The following table shows the fair value amounts included in Other current assets should the foreign currency forward contracts be in a gain position or included in Other current liabilities should these contracts be in a loss position. These amounts were recorded in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets as follows: For the foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portions of the hedging relationship and the amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were immaterial. As of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 , the notional values of the Company's outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were $310 million and $138 million , respectively. All the contracts mature within 12 months, and, upon maturity, the amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) are expected to be reclassified into earnings. The Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum of 12 months. NOTE 9. Income Taxes In the second quarter of 2017 , the Company recorded an income tax provision of $3 million , consisting of $1 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations and $3 million for withholding taxes applicable to license fee revenue from foreign locations, partially offset by $1 million of tax benefits comprising the tax effects of items credited directly to other comprehensive income, Canadian tax credits, and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits. For the six months ended July1, 2017 , the Company recorded an income tax provision of $8 million , consisting of $4 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations and $7 million for withholding taxes applicable to license fee revenue from foreign locations, partially offset by $3 million of tax benefits comprising the tax effects of items credited directly to other comprehensive income, Canadian tax credits, and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits. In the second quarter of 2016 , the Company recorded an income tax provision of $29 million , consisting of $2 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations and $2 million for withholding taxes applicable to license fee revenue from foreign locations, partially offset by $2 million of tax benefits comprising the tax effects of items credited directly to other comprehensive income and Canadian tax credits. In addition, the Company recorded the tax effect of completion of the sale of a majority equity interest in two subsidiaries comprising $21 million of income tax expense in China and $6 million of withholding tax expense associated with a future repatriation of the gain generated in China by the Chinese portion of that transaction. For the six months ended June 25, 2016, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $30 million due to foreign taxes in profitable locations and items identified above. 18  The Company has not recognized the tax benefit of future foreign tax credits associated with the withholding tax expense as the size and age profile of existing tax attributes does not allow us to satisfy the "more likely than not" criterion for the recognition of deferred tax assets. As of July1, 2017 , substantially all of the Company's U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continue to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, as of July1, 2017 , in management's estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. The Company's total gross unrecognized tax benefits is increased from $42 million in prior quarter to $58 million as of July1, 2017 . This increase is due to additional R&D unrecognized tax benefits in foreign locations . The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months. However, the settlement, resolution or closure of tax audits are highly uncertain. NOTE 10. Segment Reporting Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net and income taxes. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management's judgment. The Company has the following two reportable segments:   the Computing and Graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) and professional graphics processors; and   the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, development services, technology for game consoles and licensing portions of its intellectual property portfolio. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. This category also includes employee stock-based compensation expense and restructuring and other special charges, net. The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment:   The following table provides major items included in All Other category: 19  NOTE 11. Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans Restricted Stock Units In the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, the Company granted 1.5 million and 5.6 million shares of restricted stock units, respectively, with weighted average grant date fair values per share of $12.06 and $2.97 , respectively. In the six months ended July 1, 2017 and June 25, 2016, the Company granted 2.1 million and 6.4 million shares of restricted stock units, respectively, with weighted average grant date fair values per share of $12.18 and $2.86 , respectively. NOTE 12. Commitments and Contingencies Warranties and Indemnities The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to the Company's approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for one year. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company also offers a three-year limited warranty to end users for only those central processing unit (CPU) and AMD accelerated processing unit (APU) products that are commonly referred to as "processors in a box" and for certain server CPU products. The Company also offers extended limited warranties to certain customers of "tray" microprocessor products and/or professional graphics products who have written agreements with the Company and target their computer systems at the commercial and/or embedded markets. Changes in the Company's estimated liability for product warranty were as follows: In addition to product warranties, the Company, from time to time in its normal course of business, indemnifies other parties, with whom it enters into contractual relationships, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. In these limited matters, the Company has agreed to hold certain third parties harmless against specific types of claims or losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, third-party claims that the Company's products, when used for their intended purpose(s) and under specific conditions, infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, or other specified claims made against the indemnified party. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. Historically, payments made by the Company under these obligations have not been material. Contingencies Securities Class Action On January15, 2014, a class action lawsuit captioned Hatamian v. AMD, et al. , C.A. No.3:14-cv-00226 (the Hatamian Lawsuit) was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain individual officers for alleged violations of Section10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.The plaintiffs seek to represent a proposed class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company's common stock during the period April4, 2011 through October18, 2012.The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by the Company and the individual officers regarding the Company's 32nm technology and "Llano" product, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for the Company's common stock during the period.The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys' fees and costs. On July 7, 2014, the Company filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims. On March 31, 2015, the Court denied the motion to dismiss. On May 14, 2015, the Company filed its answer to plaintiffs' corrected amended complaint. On September 4, 2015, plaintiffs filed 20  their motion for class certification, and on March 16, 2016, the Court granted plaintiffs' motion. A court-ordered mediation held in January 2016 did not result in a settlement of the lawsuit. The discovery process has concluded. Plaintiffs and defendants have filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and briefing on those motions was completed in July 2017. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits On March 20, 2014, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Wessels v. Read, et al. , Case No. 1:14 cv-262486 (Wessels) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the Santa Clara County Superior Court of the State of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain individual directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by the Company and the individual directors and officers regarding its 32nm technology and "Llano" product, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for the Company's common stock during the period. On April 27, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Christopher Hamilton and David Hamilton v. Barnes, et al. , Case No. 5:15-cv-01890 (Hamilton) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The case was transferred to the judge handling the Hatamian Lawsuit and is now Case No. 4:15-cv-01890. On September 29, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Jake Ha v Caldwell, et al., Case No. 3:15-cv-04485 (Ha) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit also seeks a court order voiding the stockholder vote on the Company's 2015 proxy. The case was transferred to the judge handling the Hatamian Lawsuit and is now Case No. 4:15-cv-04485. The Wessels, Hamilton and Ha shareholder derivative lawsuits are currently stayed. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. ZiiLabs Litigation  On December16, 2016, a patent lawsuit captioned ZiiLabs v. AMD , C.A. No. 2:16-cv-1418 in the United States District Court for Eastern District of Texas (the "ZiiLabs Lawsuit") was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that the Company infringed four patents related generally to graphics processors and memory controllers. The complaint seeks damages, interest, and attorneys' fees. ZiiLabs filed several similar lawsuits against other companies on the same day. On the same date, ZiiLabs also filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission ("USITC") pursuant to Section337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against the Company and several other companies asserting the same four patents ("USITC Proceeding"). The complaint seeks a limited exclusion order barring the importation of certain products that contain AMD memory controllers and graphics processors.Some of the Company's customers are also named respondents.On January18, 2017, the USITC announced that it would institute the investigation, entitled 337-TA-1037, In the Matter of Certain Graphics Processors, DDR Memory Controllers, and Products Containing the Same . Discovery is ongoing, and the target date for the USITC to issue a final determination is June 25, 2018.The ZiiLabs Lawsuit has been stayed pending completion of the USITC Proceeding. On July 7, 2017, ZiiLabs filed a motion to stay the USITC Proceeding pending finalization of a settlement reached in principle. The Administrative Law Judge granted ZiiLab's motion on July 10, 2017. On July 20, 2017, the Company obtained a license to patents-in-suit. Accordingly, the Company expects that the Company and ZiiLabs will, in the near future, ask the USITC and the Court to dismiss proceedings as to the Company. The resulting settlement obligation was not material. The applicable amount of the patent license will be capitalized on the Company's balance sheet in the third quarter of 2017 and amortized over its useful life. Dickey Litigation On October 26, 2015, a putative class action complaint captioned Dickey et al. v. AMD, No. 15-cv-04922 was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs allege that the Company misled consumers by using the term "eight cores" in connection with the marketing of certain AMD FX CPUs that are based on the Company's "Bulldozer" core architecture. The plaintiffs allege these products cannot perform eight calculations simultaneously, without restriction. The plaintiffs seek to obtain damages under several causes of action for a nationwide class of consumers who allegedly were deceived into purchasing certain Bulldozer-based CPUs that were marketed as containing eight cores. The plaintiffs also seek attorneys' fees. On December 21, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted on April 7, 2016. The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint with a narrowed putative class definition, which the Court dismissed upon the Company's motion on October 31, 2016. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a second amended complaint, and the Company 21  filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. On June 14, 2017, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the Company's motion to dismiss, and allowing the plaintiffs to move forward with a portion of their complaint. The putative class definition does not encompass the Company's Ryzen or EYPC processors. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Other Legal Matters The Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on the management's current knowledge, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 13. Restructuring and Other Special Charges, Net 2015 Restructuring Plan In the third quarter of 2015, the Company implemented a restructuring plan (the 2015 Restructuring Plan) focused on its ongoing efforts to simplify its business and better align resources around its priorities and business outlook. The 2015 Restructuring Plan largely involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and included organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. The actions associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan were completed during the first quarter of 2017. The liabilities related to the 2015 Restructuring Plan recorded in Other current liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets as of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 were zero and $3 million , respectively. 2014 Restructuring Plan In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company implemented a restructuring plan (the 2014 Restructuring Plan) designed to improve operating efficiencies. The 2014 Restructuring Plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6% and an alignment of its real estate footprint with its reduced headcount. The 2014 Restructuring Plan was completed during the third quarter of 2015. The liabilities related to the 2014 Restructuring Plan recorded in Other current liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets as of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 were $1 million and $4 million , respectively.

ITEM2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The statements in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "intends," "plans," "pro forma," "estimates," "anticipates," or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. The forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: possible impact of future accounting rules on AMD's consolidated financial statements; demand for AMD's products; the growth, change and competitive landscape of the markets in which AMD participates; future restructuring activities; the nature and extent of AMD's future payments to GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) and the materiality of these payments; the materiality of AMD's future purchases from GF;AMD's ability to meet it's 2017 wafer purchase target; the expected amounts to be received by AMD under the IP licensing agreement and AMD's expected royalty payments from future product sales of China JVs' products to be developed on the basis of such licensed IP; sales patterns of AMD's PC products and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products for game consoles; the level of international sales as compared to total sales; international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future; that other unrecognized tax benefits will not materially change in the next 12 months; that AMD's cash and cash equivalents balances together with the availability under that certain secured revolving line of credit (Secured Revolving Line of Credit) made available to AMD and certain of its subsidiaries under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, will be sufficient to fund AMD's operations including capital expenditures over the next 12 months; AMD's ability to obtain sufficient external financing on favorable terms, or at all; AMD's expectation that based on the information presently known to management, the potential liability related to AMD's current litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations; AMD does not expect to pay dividends in the future; a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of AMD's revenue in the future; and anticipated sales in the third quarter of 2017. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD's ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements andrelated notes included in this report and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, and for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2016 as filed in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2016. Overview We are a global semiconductor company with facilities around the world. Within the global semiconductor industry, we offer primarily:    x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated as an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets, discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) and professional graphics processors; and    server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles. We also license portions of our intellectual property portfolio.  In this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, "us," "our" or "AMD"), including a discussion of our results of operations for the quarter and six months ended July 1, 2017 compared to the quarter and six months ended June 25, 2016 , an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations.  We believe our financial results for the second quarter of 2017 reflect our continued financial growth and focus on executing our engineering milestones. Net revenue in the second quarter of 2017 was $1.22 billion, a 19% increase compared to the second quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a 51% increase in Computing and Graphics net revenue, partially offset by a 5% decrease in Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue. The increase in Computing and Graphics segment net revenue was primarily due to higher sales from our graphics processors and our AMD Ryzen  desktop processors. The decrease in Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment net revenue was primarily driven by lower sales of our semi-custom SoCs. Our operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $25 million compared to operating loss of $8 million in the second quarter of 2016. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue, for the second quarter of 2017 was 33% compared to31%in thesecond quarter of 2016 due to a higher proportion of revenue from the Computing and Graphics segment as well as a richer product mix within the Computing and Graphics segment.  During the second quarter of 2017, we delivered a number of new products. We launched our AMD Ryzen  5 desktop processors targeting the mainstream desktop market and our AMD Ryzen PRO desktop processors for the commercial desktop market. We launched the Radeon  500 series graphics cards based on our 2nd generation "Polaris" architecture. Apple introduced their newest iMac, featuring our Radeon Pro 500 Series graphics processors that enables ultra-smooth gaming, fluid content creation, and support for GPU acceleration across a broad range of applications. We also announced the world's first professional dual-GPU card, the Radeon Pro Duo, and our first graphics card based on the next-generation "Vega" architecture for machine learning development and advanced visualization, the Radeon Vega Frontier Edition. We launched our AMD EPYC  7000 series high-performance datacenter processors, previously codenamed "Naples", with ecosystem support from leading server members like Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell. This full family of high-performance processors for cloud-based and traditional enterprise servers is based on our "Zen" x86 processor core and offers a combination of processor core count, memory footprint, and I/O bandwidth.  With respect to our balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of the end of the second quarter of 2017 were $844 million, compared to $1.26 billion at end of 2016, primarily due to changes in working capital, largely driven by wafer purchases in support of anticipated sales in the third quarter of 2017.  We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and quarter to quarter, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. 26 Results of Operations Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net and income taxes. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management's judgment. We have the following two reportable segments:   the Computing and Graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete graphics processors and professional graphics processors; and   the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, semi-custom SoC products, development services, technology for game consoles and licensing portions of our intellectual property portfolio. In addition to these reportable segments, we have an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. This category also includes employee stock-based compensation expense and restructuring and other special charges, net. We use a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. The quarters ended July1, 2017 and June25, 2016 each consisted of 13 weeks. The six months ended July1, 2017 and June25, 2016 each consisted of 26 weeks. Our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. For example, historically, first quarter PC product sales are generally lower than fourth quarter sales. In addition, with respect to our semi-custom SoC products for game consoles, we expect sales patterns to follow the seasonal trends of a consumer business with sales in the first half of the year being lower than sales in the second half of the year. The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment: Computing and Graphics Computing and Graphics net revenue of $659 million in the second quarter of 2017  increased by 51% , compared to net revenue of $435 million in the second quarter of 2016 , primarily as a result of a 31% increase in average selling price and a 12% increase in unit shipments. The increase in average selling price was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling price of our graphics processor products and our desktop processor products. The increase in average selling price was primarily due to a shift in product mix of our graphics processors and a greater mix of sales of our Ryzen desktop processors. The increase in unit shipments was primarily attributable to strong demand for our graphicsprocessors and Ryzen desktop processors. Computing and Graphics net revenue of $1,252 million in the first six months of 2017  increased by 40% , compared to net revenue of $895 million in the first six months of 2016 , primarily as a result of a 30% increase in average selling price and a 6% increase in unit shipments. The increase in average selling price was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling price of our graphics and desktop processor products. The increase in average selling price was due to a shift in product mix of our graphics processors and a greater mix of sales of our Ryzen desktop processors. The increase in unit shipments was primarily attributable to strong demand for our graphicsprocessors and Ryzen desktop processors. Computing and Graphics operating income was $7 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to an operating loss of $81 million in the second quarter of 2016 . The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue, 27  partially offset by the related increase in cost of sales  and $19 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under "Expenses" below. Computing and Graphics operating loss was $8 million in the first six months of 2017 compared to an operating loss of $151 million in the first six months of 2016 . The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue, partially offset by the related increase in cost of sales  and $27 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under "Expenses" below. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $563 million in the second quarter of 2017  decreased by 5% compared to net revenue of $592 million in the second quarter of 2016 . The decrease in net revenue was primarily due to lower sales of our semi-custom SoC products and a decrease in non-recurring engineering (NRE) revenue . Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $954 million in the first six months of 2017  decreased by 1% compared to net revenue of $964 million in the first six months of 2016 . The decrease in net revenue was primarily due to a decrease in non-recurring engineering (NRE) revenue, partially offset by higher sales of our semi-custom SoC products. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $42 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to operating income of $84 million in the second quarter of 2016 . The decline in operating results was primarily due to a $21 million increase in operating expenses and the decrease in net revenue referenced above. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under "Expenses" below. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $51 million in the first six months of 2017 compared to operating income of $100 million in the first six months of 2016 . The decline in operating results was primarily due to a $46 million increase in primarily datacenter-related operating expenses and the decrease in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $19 million increase in IP licensing gain related to the THATIC JV. The IP licensing gain was recognized for the entire first six months of 2017 compared to the first six months of 2016 . We started to recognize the IP licensing gain at the end of the first quarter of 2016. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under "Expenses" below. All Other All Other operating loss of $24 million in the second quarter of 2017 was related to stock-based compensation expense. All Other operating loss of $11 million in the second quarter of 2016 included stock-based compensation expense of $18 million, partially offset by restructuring reversals of $7 million. All Other operating loss of $47 million in the first six months of 2017 was related to stock-based compensation expense. All Other operating loss of $25 million in the first six months of 2016 included stock-based compensation expense of $34 million, partially offset by restructuring reversals of $10 million. International Sales International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 77% in the second quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2016 . International sales as a percentage of net revenue were  77% in the first six months of 2017 and 80% in the first six months of 2016 . The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in the first six months of 2017 compared to the first six months of 2016 was primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue from domestic sales of our desktop processors, graphic processors and semi-custom SoC products. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars. 28  Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net and Income Taxes The following is a summary of certain condensed consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated:  Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 33% in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 31% in the second quarter of 2016 and 33% in the first six months of 2017 compared to 32% in the first six months of 2016 . The improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by a richer product mix within the Computing and Graphics segment, primarily due to sales of our Ryzen desktop processors and a higher percentage of revenue from the Computing and Graphics segment. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses of $279 million in the second quarter of 2017  increased by $36 million , or 15% , compared to $243 million in the second quarter of 2016 . The increase was primarily due to an $18 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment mainly due to product engineering and design costs, a $15 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment due to higher datacenter related investments and a $3 million increase attributable to our All Other category as a result of stock-based compensation expense. Research and development expenses of $545 million in the first six months of 2017  increased by $60 million , or 12% , compared to $485 million in the first six months of 2016 . The increase was primarily due to a $35 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment due to higher datacenter related investments, a $17 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment mainly due to product engineering and design costs and an $8 million increase attributable to our All Other category as a result of stock-based compensation expense. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $125 million in the second quarter of 2017  increased by $8 million , or 7% , compared to $117 million in the second quarter of 2016 . The increase was primarily due to a $5 million increase attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, due to increases in sales and marketing activities, and a $2 million increase attributable to our All Other category as a result of stock-based compensation expense. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $246 million in the first six months of 2017  increased by $24 million , or 11% , compared to $222 million in the first six months of 2016 . The increase was primarily due to a $10 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment and, a $10 million increase attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, both primarily due to increases in sales and marketing activities, and a $5 million increase attributable to our All Other category as a result of stock-based compensation expense.  29  Restructuring and Other Special Charges, Net 2015 Restructuring Plan In the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan (the 2015 Restructuring Plan) focused on our ongoing efforts to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. The 2015 Restructuring Plan largely involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and included organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. The actions associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan were completed during the first quarter of 2017. The liabilities related to the 2015 Restructuring Plan recorded in Other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 were zero and $3 million , respectively. 2014 Restructuring Plan In the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented a restructuring plan (the 2014 Restructuring Plan) designed to improve operating efficiencies. The 2014 Restructuring Plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6% and an alignment of our real estate footprint with our reduced headcount. The 2014 Restructuring Plan was completed during the third quarter of 2015. The liabilities related to the 2014 Restructuring Plan recorded in Other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 were $1 million and $4 million , respectively. Interest Expense Interest expense of $32 million in the second quarter of 2017  decreased by $9 million compared to $41 million in the second quarter of 2016 primarily due to a lower overall interest rate and lower debt balance. Interest expense of $64 million in the first six months of 2017  decreased by $17 million compared to $81 million in the first six months of 2016 primarily due to a lower overall interest rate and lower debt balance. Other Income (expense), Net Other expense, net of $3 million in the second quarter of 2017 , changed by $153 million compared to $150 million Other income, net in the second quarter of 2016 primarily due to the gain on sale of equity interests in ATMP JV of $150 million in the second quarter of 2016. Other expense, net of $8 million in the first six months of 2017 , changed by $158 million compared to $150 million Other income, net in the first six months of 2016 primarily due to the gain on sale of equity interests in ATMP JV of $150 million in the first six months of 2016 and $7 million total loss on debt redemption in the first six months of 2017. Income Taxes In the second quarter of 2017 , we recorded an income tax provision of $3 million, consisting of $1 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations and $3 million for withholding taxes applicable to license fee revenue from foreign locations, partially offset by $1 million of tax benefits comprising the tax effects of items credited directly to other comprehensive income, Canadian tax credits, and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits. For the six months ended July 1, 2017, we recorded an income tax provision of $8 million, consisting of $4 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations and $7 million for withholding taxes applicable to license fee revenue from foreign locations, partially offset by $3 million of tax benefits comprising the tax effects of items credited directly to other comprehensive income, Canadian tax credits, and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits. In the second quarter of 2016 , we recorded an income tax provision of $29 million, consisting of $2 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations and $2 million for withholding taxes applicable to license fee revenue from foreign locations partially offset by $2 million of tax benefits comprising the tax effects of items credited to other comprehensive income and Canadian tax credits. In addition, we recorded the tax effect of completion of the sale of a majority equity interest in two subsidiaries comprising $21 million of income tax expense in China and $6 million of withholding tax expense associated with a future repatriation of the gain generated in China by the Chinese portion of that transaction. For the six months ended June 25, 2016, we recorded an income tax provision of $30 million due to foreign taxes in profitable locations and items identified above. We have not recognized the tax benefit of future foreign tax credits associated with the withholding tax expense as the size and age profile of existing tax attributes does not allow us to satisfy the "more likely than not" criterion for the recognition of deferred tax assets. As of July1, 2017 , substantially all of our U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continue to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income, which as of July1, 2017 , in our estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. 30  Our total gross unrecognized tax benefits is increased from $42 million in prior quarter to $58 million as of July1, 2017 . This increase is due to additional R&D unrecognized tax benefits in foreign locations. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months. However, the settlement, resolution or closure of our tax audits are highly uncertain. Stock-Based Compensation Expense The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and restricted stock units, which we allocated in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as follows: For all periods presented, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and therefore did not record any related operating cash flows. Stock-based compensation expense of $24 million in the second quarter of 2017  increased by $6 million compared to $18 million in the second quarter of 2016 . Stock-based compensation expense of $47 million in the first six months of 2017  increased by $13 million compared to $34 million in the first six months of 2016 . The increase was primarily due to a higher weighted average grant date fair value of unvested restricted stock units in the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 , compared to the three and six months ended June 25, 2016 . The increase was also driven by the absence of the stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units with market condition in the first six months of 2016, as these awards were granted in the second half of 2016. GLOBALFOUNDRIES Wafer Supply Agreement. The Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF). Sixth Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement . On August 30, 2016, we entered into a sixth amendment (the Sixth Amendment) to the WSA. The Sixth Amendment modified certain terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor, graphics processor and semi-custom products for a five-year period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020. AMD and GF also agreed to establish a comprehensive framework for technology collaboration for the 7nm technology node. The Sixth Amendment also provides us a limited waiver with rights to contract with another wafer foundry with respect to certain products in the 14nm and 7nm technology nodes and gives us greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services across our product portfolio. In consideration for these rights, we agreed to pay GF $100 million in installments starting in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 through the third fiscal quarter of 2017. During the second fiscal quarter of 2017, we paid GF $25 million and, as of July1, 2017 , we had paid GF $75 million in aggregate. Starting in 2017 and continuing through 2020, we also agreed to make quarterly payments to GF based on the volume of certain wafers purchased from another wafer foundry. Further, for each calendar year during the term of the Sixth Amendment, AMD and GF agreed to annual wafer purchase targets that increase from 2016 through 2020. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any calendar year, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the our actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. The annual targets were established based on our business and market expectations and took into account the limited waiver we received for certain products. As of July1, 2017 , we expected to meet our 2017 wafer purchase target. AMD and GF also agreed on fixed pricing for wafers purchased during 2016 and established a framework to agree on annual wafer pricing for the years 2017 to 2020. AMD and GF have agreed on pricing for wafer purchases for 2017. 31 Our total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing, research and development activities and other for the quarters ended July1, 2017 and June25, 2016 were $266 million and $85 million , respectively. Our total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing, research and development activities and other for the six months ended July1, 2017 and June25, 2016 were $442 million and $293 million , respectively. As of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 , the amount of prepayment and other receivables related to GF was $7 million and $32 million , respectively, included in Prepayment and other receivables - related parties on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 , the amount payable to GF was $229 million and $255 million , respectively, included in Payable to related parties on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Warrant Agreement . Also on August 30, 2016, in consideration for the limited waiver and rights under the Sixth Amendment, we entered into a warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement) with West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala). Under the Warrant Agreement, WCH and its permitted assigns are entitled to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock (the Warrant Shares) at a purchase price of $5.98 per share. The warrant is exercisable in whole or in part until February 29, 2020, provided that the maximum number of Warrant Shares that may be exercised prior to the one-year anniversary of the Warrant Agreement cannot exceed 50 million. The warrant will be fully exercisable as of August 30, 2017. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Warrant Agreement will only be exercisable to the extent that Mubadala does not beneficially own, either directly through any other entities directly and indirectly owned by Mubadala or its subsidiaries, an aggregate of more than 19.99% of our outstanding capital stock after any such exercise. GF continues to be a related party of AMD because Mubadala and Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech, a party to the WSA) are affiliated with WCH, our largest stockholder. GF, WCH and Mubadala Tech are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mubadala. Equity Interest Purchase Agreement - ATMP Joint Venture On April 29, 2016, we and certain of our subsidiaries completed the sale of a majority of the equity interests in Suzhou TF-AMD Semiconductor Co., Ltd. (formerly, AMD Technologies (China) Co., Ltd.), and TF AMD Microelectronics (Penang) Sdn. Bhd. (formerly, Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd.), to affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. (formerly, Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd.) (TFME), a Chinese joint stock company, to form two joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JV). As a result of the sale, TFME's affiliates own 85% of the equity interests in the ATMP JV while certain of our subsidiaries own the remaining 15%. We have no obligation to fund the ATMP JV. We account for our equity interests in the ATMP JV under the equity method of accounting due to our significant influence over the ATMP JV. As of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 , the carrying value of our investment in the ATMP JV was approximately $58 million and $59 million , respectively. Following the deconsolidation, the ATMP JV is our related party. The ATMP JV provides assembly, test, mark and packaging (ATMP) services to us. We currently pay the ATMP JV for ATMP services on a cost-plus basis. Our total purchases from the ATMP JV during the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 amounted to approximately $105 million and $201 million , respectively. Our total purchases from the ATMP JV during the three and six months ended June 25, 2016 amounted to approximately $66 million . As of July1, 2017 and December31, 2016 , the amount payable to the ATMP JV was $145 million and $128 million , respectively, included in Payables to related parties on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 , we recorded $3 million and $5 million , respectively, in Equity loss in investee on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, which included certain expenses incurred by us on behalf of the ATMP JV. During the three and six months ended June 25, 2016 , we recorded a loss of $3 million , in Equity loss in investee on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, which included certain expenses incurred by us on behalf of the ATMP JV. Equity Joint Venture - Intellectual Property Licensing Agreement In February 2016, we and Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity (JV Partner), formed a joint venture comprised of two separate legal entities, China JV1 and China JV2 (collectively, the THATIC JV). Our equity share in China JV1 and China JV2 is a majority and minority interest, respectively, funded by our contribution of certain of our patents. The JV Partner is responsible for the initial and on-going financing of the THATIC JV's operations. We have no obligations to fund the THATIC JV. We concluded the China JV1 and China JV2 are not operating joint ventures and are variable interest entities due to their reliance on on-going financing by the JV Partner. We determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of either China JV1 or China JV2, as we do not have unilateral power to direct selling and marketing, manufacturing and product development activities related to the THATIC JV's products. Accordingly, we will not consolidate either of these entities and therefore account for our investments in the THATIC JV under the equity method of accounting. The THATIC JV is a related party of ours. 32 In February 2016, we licensed certain of our intellectual property (Licensed IP) to the THATIC JV for a total of approximately $293 million in license fee payable over several years contingent upon achievement of certain milestones. We also expect to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV's products to be developed on the basis of such Licensed IP. We will also provide certain engineering and technical support to the THATIC JV in connection with the product development. In March 2017, we entered into a development and intellectual property agreement with THATIC JV, and also expect to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV's products to be developed on the basis of such agreement. We will also provide certain engineering and technical support to the THATIC JV in connection with the product development. We recognize income related to the Licensed IP over the period commencing upon delivery of the first Licensed IP milestone through the date of the milestone that requires our continuing involvement in the product development process. Royalty payments will be recognized in income once earned. We will classify Licensed IP income and royalty income as other operating income. During the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 , we recognized $25 million and $52 million licensing gain associated with the Licensed IP, respectively, and development fees of $6 million and $10 million , respectively, as a credit to research and development expenses. During the three and six months ended June 25, 2016 , we recognized $26 million and $33 million licensing gain, respectively. No development fee credit associated with these agreements was recognized during the three and six months ended June 25, 2016 . No royalty income was recognized during the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 and June25, 2016 . Our total exposure to losses through our investment in the THATIC JV is limited to our investment in the THATIC JV, which was zero as of July1, 2017 . Our share in the net losses of the THATIC JV for the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 and June25, 2016 was not material and is not recorded in our condensed consolidated statement of operations since we are not obligated to fund the THATIC JV's losses in excess of our investment in the THATIC JV. Our receivable from THATIC JV was $2 million and zero as of July1, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, included in Prepayment and other receivables - related parties on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of July1, 2017 , the total assets and liabilities of the THATIC JV were not material. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of July1, 2017 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $844 million compared to $1.26 billion as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in the six months of 2017 was due to net cash used in our operating and investing activities as described below. The percentage of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held domestically was 93% as of July1, 2017 , compared to 98% at December 31, 2016. The following is a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:  Our aggregate debt obligations of $1.42 billion, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized debt discount associated with the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 (2.125% Notes) as of July1, 2017 , decreased from $1.44 billion at December 31, 2016. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance along with our Secured Revolving Line of Credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe that in the event we decide to obtain external funding, we may be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. Should we require additional funding, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our business. If market conditions deteriorate, we may be 33  limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $381 million in the first six months ended July 1, 2017 compared to $127 million in the first six months ended June 25, 2016 . The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital, largely driven by wafer purchases in support of anticipated sales in the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher cash collection primarily due to higher revenue in the first six months ended July 1, 2017 compared to the first six months ended June 25, 2016 . Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $122 million in the first six months ended July 1, 2017 , which consisted of net cash outflows of $84 million from purchases and maturities of available-for-sale securities and $35 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities was $303 million in the first six months ended June 25, 2016 , which consisted of net cash inflow of $351 million from sale of equity interests in the ATMP JV, partially offset by a cash outflow of $47 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $1 million in the first six months ended July 1, 2017 , which consisted of a cash outflow of $42 million to repurchase a portion of our 7% Notes and $11 million for tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock, partially offset by a cash inflow of net proceeds from borrowings pursuant to our Secured Revolving Line of Credit of $42 million and $10 million for proceeds from issuance of common stock from the exercise of employee stock options. Net cash used in financing activities was $4 million in the first six months ended June 25, 2016 primarily due to $4 million net repayments of Secured Revolving Line of Credit borrowings. 34 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual obligations, as of July1, 2017 , and is supplemented by the discussion following the table:  (1) Amounts largely represent future fixed and non-cancelable cash payments associated with software technology and licenses and IP licenses, including the payments due within the next 12 months. (2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding debt obligations that are payable in cash, excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. (3) We have purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we acquire. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (4) Includes our currently expected purchases from GF for the remainder of 2017 for wafer manufacturing and research and development activities and minimum purchase obligations for wafer purchases for years 2018 through 2020. We cannot meaningfully quantify or estimate our future purchase obligations to GF beyond 2020 but expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. (5) Total amount excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets except for debt obligations and other liabilities related to software and technology licenses and IP licenses. The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. 6.75% Senior Notes Due 2019 On February 26, 2014, we issued $600 million of our 6.75% Senior Notes Due 2019 (6.75% Notes). Our 6.75% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning September 1, 2014 until the maturity date of March1, 2019. Our 6.75% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 6.75% Indenture) dated February 26, 2014 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. At any time before March 1, 2019, we may redeem some or all of our 6.75% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a "make whole" premium (as set forth in the 6.75% Indenture). On February 10, 2017, we settled $5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% Notes with treasury stock. As of July1, 2017 , the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% Notes was $191 million . 7.50% Senior Notes Due 2022 On August15, 2012, we issued $500 million of our 7.50% Senior Notes Due 2022 (7.50% Notes). Our 7.50% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on February15 and August15 of each year beginning February15, 2013 until the maturity date of August15, 2022. Our 7.50% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.50% Indenture) dated August15, 2012 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. Prior to August15, 2022, we may redeem some or all of our 7.50% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a "make whole" premium (as set forth in the 7.50% Indenture). 35  On February 10, 2017, we settled $3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes with treasury stock. As of July1, 2017 , the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes was $347 million . 7.00% Senior Notes Due 2024 On June 16, 2014, we issued $500 million of our 7.00% Senior Notes Due 2024 (7.00% Notes). The 7.00% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year beginning January 1, 2015 until the maturity date of July1, 2024. The 7.00% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.00% Indenture) dated June 16, 2014 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. At any time before July 1, 2017, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 7.00% Notes within 90 days of the closing of an equity offering with the net proceeds thereof at a redemption price equal to 107.000% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. Prior to July 1, 2019, we may redeem some or all of the 7.00% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a "make whole" premium (as set forth in the 7.00% Indenture). Starting July 1, 2019, we may redeem our 7.00% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest:  During the first quarter of 2017, we settled $26 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Notes with treasury stock. During the second quarter of 2017, we repurchased $40 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Notes for $42 million. As of July1, 2017 , the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Notes was $350 million .  2.125% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 On September 14, 2016, we issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes. We also granted an option to the underwriters to purchase up to an additional $105 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes. On September 28, 2016, this option was exercised in full and we issued an additional $105 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes. Our 2.125% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations and will mature on September 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. Interest is payable in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on March 1, 2017. Our 2.125% Notes are governed by the terms of a base indenture and a supplemental indenture (together the 2.125% Indentures) dated September 14, 2016 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2026 under the occurrence of one of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after June 1, 2026 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the our common stock, at our election. The first event described in (1) above was met during the second quarter of 2017 and as a result, the 2.125% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder as of July 1, 2017 and remain convertible until September 30, 2017. Our current intent is to deliver shares of our common stock upon conversion of the 2.125% Notes. As such, 36 we continued to classify the carrying value of the liability component of the 2.125% Notes as long-term debt and the equity component of the 2.125% Notes as permanent equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of July 1, 2017. We may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the 2.125% Notes. The conversion rate is currently 125.0031shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2.125% Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.00per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances. If we undergo a fundamental change prior to the maturity date of the notes, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2.125% Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2.125% Notes to be repurchased,plusaccrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. As of July1, 2017 , the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes was $805 million.  Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of our 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and 2.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer when we believe the market conditions are favorable. Secured Revolving Line of Credit  Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement  On April14, 2015, AMD and its subsidiaries, AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd. (AMDISS) and ATI Technologies ULC (collectively, the Loan Parties), entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement (the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) by and among the Loan Parties, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as lenders (the Lenders) and Bank of America, N.A., acting as agent for the Lenders (the Agent).  Fifth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement  On March 21, 2017, the Loan Parties entered into a fifth amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the Fifth Amendment) by and among the Loan Parties, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as lenders and the Agent, which modifies the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The Fifth Amendment amends the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement by, among other things, extending the maturity date of the Secured Revolving Line of Credit from April 14, 2020 to March21, 2022, reducing the Applicable Margin (as defined in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement), reducing the commitment fee, lowering the minimum threshold of Availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) required to be maintained by AMD and AMDISS in order to avoid cash dominion, amending the borrowing base reporting requirement, amending maximum dollar limits related to supply chain finance arrangements, and reducing the amount of the Secured Revolving Line of Credit available for the issuance for letters of credit from $75 million to $45 million.  The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement provides for a Secured Revolving Line of Credit for a principal amount up to $500 million with up to $45 million available for issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit are limited to up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable ( 90% for certain qualified eligible accounts receivable), minus specified reserves. The size of the commitments under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be increased by up to an aggregate amount of $200 million .  The Secured Revolving Line of Credit is secured by a first priority security interest in the Loan Parties' accounts receivable, inventory, deposit accounts maintained with the Agent and other specified assets, including books and records. As of July1, 2017 , the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had an outstanding loan balance of $42 million, at an interest rate of 4.75%. As of December31, 2016 , we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit. As of July1, 2017 , we had $19 million letters of credit outstanding and up to $249 million available for future borrowings under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit. We report our intra-period changes in our revolving credit balance on a net basis in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as we intend the period of the borrowings to be brief, repaying borrowed amounts within 90 days. As of July1, 2017 , we were in compliance with all required covenants in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. 37  The agreements governing our 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes, 2.125% Notes and Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2028. We lease certain office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of July1, 2017 were $271 million , including $226 million of future lease payments and estimated operating costs related to the real estate transactions that occurred in Austin, Texas; Sunnyvale and Santa Clara, California; Markham, Ontario, Canada; and Singapore. During the second quarter of 2016, we signed an amendment to the lease agreement associated with our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California so that the lease expires in December 2017. In connection with the amendment, the lease payments were reduced for 2017. During the third quarter of 2016, we entered into a 10 year operating lease to occupy 220,000 square feet of new office space in Santa Clara, California. Base rent payments commence in August 2017 and the total estimate base rent payments over the life of the lease are approximately $104 million . In addition to the base rent payments, we will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for our share of operating expenses and tax obligations. We will also incur costs for capital projects on the new office space. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for two additional five-year periods. Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations primarily include our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties, excluding our wafer purchase commitments to GF under the WSA. As of July1, 2017 , total non-cancelable purchase obligations were $516 million . Obligations to GF Our currently expected purchases from GF for the remainder of 2017 for wafer and research and development activities, and minimum purchase obligations for wafer purchases for years 2018 through 2020 are approximately $3.2 billion . We are not able to meaningfully quantify or estimate our future purchase obligations to GF beyond this amount but expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of July1, 2017 , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our net revenue, inventories, asset impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management's expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. Management believes there have been no significant changes during the quarter and six months ended July 1, 2017 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting estimates in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2016 . We will perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of 2017 pursuant to our accounting policy. However, we will also test for goodwill impairment at any time during the year if there are indicators of impairment present. If there are declines in our market capitalization, business climate or operating results, we may incur impairment charges that could be material. 38
