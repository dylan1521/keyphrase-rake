NOTESTO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ("we," "us," "our," "Advanced Energy," or the "Company") design, manufacture, sell, and support power conversion products that transform power into various usable forms. Our products enable manufacturing processes that use thin film for various products, such as semiconductor devices, flat panel displays, thin film renewables, architectural glass, optical coating and consumer products decorative and functional coating. We also supply thermal instrumentation products for advanced temperature control in the thin film process for these same markets. Our power control modules provide power control solutions for industrial applications where heat treatment and processing are used such as glass manufacturing, metal fabrication and treatment, and material and chemical processing. Our high voltage power supplies and modules are used in applications such as semiconductor ion implantation, scanning electron microscopy, chemical analysis such as mass spectrometry and various applications using X-ray technology and electron guns for both analytical and processing applications. Our network of global service support centers provides a recurring revenue opportunity as we offer repair services, conversions, upgrades, and refurbishments and used equipment to companies using our products. As of December 31, 2015, we discontinued the production, engineering, and sales of our Inverter product line. As such, all Inverter revenues, costs, assets and liabilities are reported in Discontinued Operations for all periods presented herein. See Note 2. Discontinued Operations. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal, recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company at March31, 2016 , and the results of our operations and cash flows for the three months ended  March31, 2016 and 2015 . The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the fiscal year ended December31, 2015 and other financial information filed with the SEC. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S.GAAP requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that the significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when accounting for items and matters such as allowances for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory, warranty reserves, acquisitions, asset valuations, goodwill, asset life, depreciation, amortization, recoverability of assets, impairments, deferred revenue, stock option and restricted stock grants, taxes, and other provisions are reasonable, based upon information available at the time they are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates, making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our accounting policies are described in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2015 . NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standards setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements. Updates to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update ("ASU"). Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued guidance, whether adopted or to be adopted in the future, is not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption. In April 2014, the FASB issued guidance redefining discontinued operations and requiring only those disposals of components of an entity, including classifications as held for sale, that represent a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major 7  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) effect on an entity's operations and financial results to be reported as discontinued operations. In addition, the new standard expands the disclosure requirements of discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2015, we have discontinued our inverter engineering, sales, and production and have applied this guidance to our Consolidated Financial Statements herein. See Note 2. Discontinued Operations. In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers, which implements a five step process for how an entity should recognize revenue in order to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective for us beginning the first quarter of 2018. Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing reporting. In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet instead of separating into current and noncurrent amounts. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, on a prospective or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for all companies in any interim or annual period. Advanced Energy has not determined in what period it will adopt or what adoption method it will use and is currently assessing the impact that this guidance may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Advanced Energy has determined that as of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 , the result of adoption would be the reclass of approximately $20.3 million and $20.3 million , respectively, from current assets to non-current assets. Of these, $14.3 million and $14.3 million , respectively, would have been reflected in discontinued operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases.The new guidance also requires additional disclosures related to leasing transactions.The standard is effective for the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of cash flows. NOTE 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The wind down of our inverter engineering, manufacturing and sales was completed in December 2015 and is reflected as "Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes" on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented herein. The sale of extended inverter warranties are reflected in deferred revenue from continuing operations on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be reflected in Continuing operations in future periods as the deferred revenue is earned and the associated services are rendered. The significant items included in "Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes" are as follows:     8  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) Assets and Liabilities of discontinued operations within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised of the following: *Any changes in the estimates which underlie these accruals and reserves will be reflected in "Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax" in future periods. NOTE 3. INCOME TAXES The following table sets out the tax expense and the effective tax rate for our income (loss) from continuing operations (in thousands): The effective tax rates for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of the earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates. Our policy is to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. For the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 , the amount of interest and penalties accrued related to our unrecognized tax benefits was not significant. NOTE 4. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the numerator is increased to exclude charges that would not have been incurred, and the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding (using the if-converted and treasury stock methods), if securities containing potentially dilutive common shares (e.g., stock options and restricted stock units) had been converted to common shares, and if such assumed conversion is dilutive. 9  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) The following is a reconciliation of the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS (in thousands, except per share data): The following stock options and restricted stock units were excluded in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive (in thousands):  Stock Buyback In September 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $150.0 million of our stock over a thirty-month period. Under this program, on November 6, 2015, we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase arrangement with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (the "Counterparty") pursuant to a Fixed Dollar Accelerated Share Repurchase Transaction (the "ASR Agreement") to purchase $50.0 million of shares of our common stock. On November 9, 2015, we advanced $50.0 million to the Counterparty. This transaction used $39.6 million and we received 1.4 million shares of our common stock based on then-current market prices of the $50.0 million advanced, representing 79.2% of the estimated shares to be repurchased under the ASR Agreement. The initial payment was recorded as a reduction to Stockholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March31, 2016 . The ASR Agreement settled on April 11, 2016. See Note 22. Subsequent Event for details on the final settlement. All shares repurchased were executed in the open market and no shares were repurchased from related parties. Repurchased shares were retired and assumed the status of authorized and unissued shares. NOTE 5. MARKETABLE SECURITIES Our investments with original maturities of more than three months at time of purchase are considered marketable securities available for sale. Our marketable securities consist of commercial paper and certificates of deposit as follows (in thousands):    10  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) The maturities of our marketable securities available for sale as of March31, 2016 are as follows: The value and liquidity of the marketable securities we hold are affected by market conditions, as well as the ability of the issuers of such securities to make principal and interest payments when due, and the functioning of the markets in which these securities are traded. Our current investments in marketable securities are expected to be liquidated during the next twelve months. As of March31, 2016 , we do not believe any of the underlying issuers of our marketable securities are presently at risk of default. NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward contracts. During the three months ended  March31, 2016 and 2015 , we entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to attempt to mitigate the exchange rate risk associated with intercompany debt denominated in nonfunctional currencies. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges; however, they tend to offset the fluctuations of our intercompany debt due to foreign exchange rate changes. These forward contracts are typically for one month periods. We did not have foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of March31, 2016 . At December31, 2015 we had outstanding Euro forward contracts. As of March31, 2016 , we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts. The notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts at March 31, 2015 was $13.3 million , and the difference between the fair value and the notional value of these contracts was not significant. During the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 , we recognized a loss of $1.0 million and a gain of $1.5 million , respectively. These losses and gains were offset by corresponding gains and losses, respectively, on the related underlying intercompany debt and both are included as a component of Other income (expense), net, in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the three months ended  March31, 2016 , we settled several intercompany notes and reduced our exposure to foreign exchange volatility. NOTE 7. ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE The following tables present information about our financial assets measured at fair value, on a recurring basis, as of March31, 2016 , and December31, 2015 . The tables indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. We did not have any financial liabilities measured at fair value, on a recurring basis, as of March31, 2016 , and December31, 2015 . There were no transfers in or out of Level1, 2, or 3 fair value measurements during the three months ended March31, 2016 .   11  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC.

OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES As of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 , Other accrued liabilities was $11.3 million and $12.3 million , respectively. No individual items in Other accrued expenses exceeded 5% of total current liabilities.   13  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) NOTE 13. RESTRUCTURING COSTS In June 2015, we committed to a restructuring plan in relation to the wind-down of our Inverter operations which has been completed as of December 31, 2015. Charges related to this plan that have an effect on continuing operations include strategic headcount reductions, streamlining operational processes and condensing administrative functions to improve efficiencies. The following table summarizes our liabilities under the 2015 plan (in thousands): NOTE 14. WARRANTIES Provisions of our sales agreements include product warranties customary to these types of agreements, ranging from 12 months to 24 months following installation. Our provision for the estimated cost of warranties is recorded when revenue is recognized. The warranty provision is based on historical experience by product, configuration and geographic region. We establish accruals for warranty issues that are probable to result in future costs. Changes in product warranty accruals are as follows (in thousands): NOTE 15. PENSION LIABILITY In connection with the HiTek acquisition on April 12, 2014, we acquired the HiTek Power Limited Pension Scheme ("HPLPS"). The HPLPS has been closed to new participants and additional accruals since 2006. In order to measure the expense and related benefit obligation, various assumptions are made including discount rates used to value the obligation, expected return on plan assets used to fund these expenses and estimated future inflation rates. These assumptions are based on historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. An actuarial analysis is used to measure the expense and liability associated with pension benefits. The net amount of the pension liability on our balance sheets as of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 was $17.5 million and $17.8 million , respectively, recorded in Other long-term liabilities. The components of the net periodic pension expense for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands): 14  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) NOTE 16. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION We recognize stock-based compensation expense in Cost of sales, Research and development, and Selling, general & administrative expenses based on the fair value of the awards issued and the functional area of the employee receiving the award. Stock-based compensation for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands): Stock Options Stock option awards, other than awards under our 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan ("2015 LTI Plan"), are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock at the date of grant, a four -year vesting schedule, and a term of 10 years. Under our 2015 LTI Plan, we made grants of time-based options during the first quarter of 2015, which will vest annually over a three-year period. The fair value of each grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model utilizing an expected volatility of 43.4% , a risk-free rate of 1.1% , a dividend yield of zero, and an expected term of 4.3 years . The weighted-average grant date fair value of the options is $9.53 per share. A summary of our time based stock option activity for the three months ended March31, 2016 is as follows (in thousands): Changes in outstanding performance based stock options during the three months ended March31, 2016 were as follows (in thousands): Restricted Stock Units Restricted Stock Units ("RSU"), except for those under our 2015 LTI Plan and our 2016-2018 Long Term Incentive Plan ("2016-2018 LTI Plan"), are generally granted with a three- or four-year vesting schedule. Under our 2015 LTI Plan, we made grants of performance based and time-based awards during the first quarter of 2015. The time-based awards will vest annually over a three-year period and the performance based awards will vest in the next year based on the Company's achievement of return on net assets targets established by our Board of Directors at the beginning of 2015. The awards were granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock at the date of grant. Under our 2016-2018 LTI Plan, we made grants of performance based and time-based awards during the first quarter of 2016. The time-based awards will vest annually over a three-year period and the performance based awards will vest over a three-year period based on the Company's achievement of non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations and revenue targets established by our Board of Directors at the beginning of 2016. The awards were granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock at the date of grant. 15  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Special Note on Forward-Looking Statements The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Statements in this report that are not historical information are forward-looking statements. For example, statements relating to our beliefs, expectations and plans are forward-looking statements, as are statements that certain actions, conditions or circumstances will continue. The inclusion of words such as "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "can," "may," "might," "continue," "enables," "plan," "intend," "should," "could," "would," or "believe," as well as statements that events or circumstances "will" occur or continue, indicate forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. For additional information regarding factors that may affect our actual financial condition, results of operations and accuracy of our forward-looking statements, see the information under the caption "Risk Factors" in Part II Item1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2015 . We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason. BUSINESS OVERVIEW We design, manufacture, sell and support precision power products that transform power into various usable forms. Our products enable manufacturing processes that use thin film and plasma enhanced chemical and physical processing for various products, industrial electro-thermal applications for material and chemical processes, and precision power for analytical instrumentation. We also supply thermal instrumentation products for advanced temperature control in these markets. Our network of global service support centers provides local repair and field service capability in key regions which provide upgrades and refurbishments, and used equipment to businesses that use our products. Precision power products include:   Our power conversion products refine, modify and control the raw electrical power from a utility and convert it into power that is predictable, repeatable and customizable. Our power conversion products are primarily used in processing equipment that is used by semiconductor, solar panel, and similar thin film manufacturers, including flat panel display, data storage, hard and optical coating, and architectural glass manufacturers.   Our power control modules provide power control solutions for industrial applications where heat treatment and processing are used, such as glass manufacturing, metal fabrication and treatment, and material and chemical processing.   Our high voltage products provide high voltage power supplies that are used in diverse applications including semiconductor ion implantation and scanning electron microscopy, medical equipment, and instrumentation applications such as x-ray and mass spectroscopy, as well as general electron gun sources for scientific and industrial applications.   Our thermal instrumentation products, used primarily in the semiconductor industry, provide temperature measurement and control solutions for applications in which time-temperature cycles affect productivity and yield. These products are used in rapid thermal processing, chemical vapor deposition, and other semiconductor and solar applications requiring non-contact temperature measurement. Our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be helpful for understanding our historical performance and relevant trends going forward. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in PartI, Item1 of this report, including the notes thereto. Also included in the following analysis are measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP is provided below.     18 Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain data derived from our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands): The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of sales represented by certain items reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations: SALES The following tables summarize sales, and percentages of sales, by segment for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): Total Sales Overall, our sales decreased  $6.5 million , or 5.9% , to $103.0 million for the three months ended March31, 2016 from $109.5 million for the three months ended March31, 2015 due to lower sales after a very strong Q1 2015. In the three months ended March31, 2016 , sales to the semiconductor market decreased  4.7% to $69.7 million from $73.2 million for the three months ended March31, 2015 . Market conditions regained strength across the semiconductor market 19 from the second half of 2015 driven by our leadership in etch applications, specifically related to advanced memory and the transition to 3DNAND, along with advances in logic technology. These investments are contributing to the substantial growth over the last several quarters. We expect current in investment levels to increase in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to current levels. Sales in the industrial precision power capital equipment markets decreased  18.8% to $16.5 million , or 16.1% of sales, for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to $20.4 million , or 18.6% of sales, for the three months ended March31, 2015 due to softness across the global industrial markets. Outside of semiconductor capital equipment, other markets we serve include solar panel, flat panel display, power control modules, data storage, architectural glass, high voltage and other industrial manufacturing markets. Our customers in these markets are primarily global and regional OEMs. Our global service revenue increased  5.3% to $16.8 million , or 16.2% of total sales, for the three months ended March31, 2016 , compared to $15.9 million , or 14.5% of sales, for the three months ended March31, 2015 primarily due to share gains in the semiconductor service industry. Operating income was $23.6 million for the three months ended March31, 2016 , a decrease of $7.9 million from the same period of 2015 . Lower sales volumes and higher expenses resulted in lower operating income. Backlog Our overall backlog was $56.5 million at March31, 2016 as compared to $43.7 million at December31, 2015 . The increase is primarily the result of expected increased demand in connection with the anticipated rebound of the semiconductor market. GROSS PROFIT Our gross profit was $53.5 million , or 51.9% of sales, for the three months ended March31, 2016 , as compared to $59.1 million , or 54.0% of sales for the three months ended March31, 2015 . The quarter over quarter decrease in absolute dollars was due to lower sales volume and change in sales mix for product and service. OPERATING EXPENSE The following table summarizes our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): Research and Development The markets we serve constantly present opportunities to develop products for new or emerging applications and require technological changes driving for higher performance, lower cost, and other attributes that we expect may advance our customers' products. We believe that continued and timely development of new and differentiated products, as well as enhancements to existing products to support customer requirements, are critical for us to compete in the markets we serve. Accordingly, we devote significant personnel and financial resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, and we expect these investments to continue. Research and development expenses for the three months ended March31, 2016 were $10.8 million , or 10.5% of sales, as compared to $9.8 million , or 8.9% of sales in the same period of 2015 . Research and development costs were higher in 2016 largely due to investments in new programs reflecting our commitment to keep pace with our customers' next-generation technologies. 20 Selling, General and Administrative Our selling expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel, trade shows, advertising, third-party sales representative commissions, and other selling and marketing activities. Our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate, legal, tax, financial, governance, administrative, information systems, and human resource functions in addition to our general management, including acquisition-related activities. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased  $1.3 million for three months ended March31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily driven by higher sales expense as we added presence in additional geographic markets as well as higher stock compensation expense associated with our executive compensation programs and higher audit costs. Other Income (Expenses), net Other income (expenses), net consists primarily of interest income and expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses on sales of fixed assets, and other miscellaneous items. Other income (expenses), net was a gain of $0.4 million for the three months ended March31, 2016 , as compared to a gain of $0.9 million for the three months ended March31, 2015 . The change is primarily due to the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and the location of our cash in different countries. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision for the three months ended March31, 2016 of $3.8 million compared to $6.7 million for the three months ended March31, 2015 , resulting in effective tax rates of 15.7% and 20.8% , respectively. The effective tax rates for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of the earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof and the geographic composition of our pre-tax income. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust our effective income tax rate accordingly. Discontinued Operations The significant items included in "Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes" are as follows: Non-GAAP Results To evaluate business performance against business objectives and for planning purposes, management uses non-GAAP results. Management and our investors use this to review our business from the same perspective as management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods as well as comparisons of our results with other industry participants. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  21 The non-GAAP results presented below exclude the impact of non-cash related charges, such as restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets; acquisition-related costs; and other nonrecurring costs, as they are not indicative of future performance (in thousands):  Impact of Inflation In recent years, inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations. However, we continuously monitor operating price increases, particularly in connection with the supply of component parts used in our manufacturing process. To the extent permitted by competition, we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales prices over time. From time to time, we may also receive pressure from customers to decrease sales prices due to reductions in the cost structure of our products from cost improvement initiatives and decreases in component part prices. Liquidity and Capital Resources LIQUIDITY We believe that adequate liquidity and cash generation is important to the execution of our strategic initiatives. Our ability to fund our operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and product development efforts may depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to future operating performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. Our primary sources of liquidity are our available cash, investments, and cash generated from current operations as well as our credit facilities discussed in Note 21. Credit Facilities in ITEM 1 "Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements." At March31, 2016 , we had $184.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $14.2 million of availability on our Wells Fargo Credit Facility. We believe that our current cash levels and our cash flows from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs, anticipated levels of capital expenditures, and contractual obligations for the next twelve months. We may seek additional financing from time to time. 22 In September 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $150.0 million of our stock over a thirty-month period. Under this program, on November 6, 2015, we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase arrangement with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (the "Counterparty") pursuant to a Fixed Dollar Accelerated Share Repurchase Transaction (the "ASR Agreement") to purchase $50.0 million of shares of our common stock. On November 9, 2015, we advanced $50.0 million to the Counterparty. This transaction used $39.6 million and we received 1.4 million shares of our common stock based on then-current market prices of the $50.0 million advanced, representing 79% of the estimated shares to be repurchased under the ASR Agreement. The initial payment was recorded as a reduction to Stockholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March31, 2016 . The ASR Agreement settled on April 11, 2016. See Note 22. Subsequent Event in ITEM 1 "Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements," for details on the final settlement. CASH FLOWS A summary of our cash provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities is as follows (in thousands): 2016 CASH FLOWS COMPARED TO 2015  Net cash provided by operating activities   Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the three months ended March31, 2016 was $11.6 million , compared to $28.6 million for the same period ended March31, 2015 . The decrease of $17.0 million in net cash flows from operating activities is the result of higher investment in inventory and higher accounts receivable due to a rebound in the semiconductor market in 2016. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities  Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the three months ended March31, 2016 was $3.0 million , an increase of $3.4 million from the same period ended March31, 2015 . The increase was primarily driven by the maturity of several marketable securities in the three months ended March31, 2016 . Net cash provided by financing activities  Net cash provided by financing activities in the three months ended March31, 2016 was $1.3 million , a $1.0 million change from the cash provided by financing activities of $2.3 million in the same period of 2015 . This was primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from stock options.  23 Effect of currency translation on cash During the three months ended March31, 2016 , currency translation had a negative  $0.5 million impact on cash compared to a negative impact of $3.0 million in the same period of 2015 primarily due to the slight recovery in the Euro year over year. Our foreign operations primarily sell product and incur expenses in the related local currency. Exchange rate fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. The functional currencies of our worldwide operations include U.S. dollar ("USD"), Canadian Dollar ("CAD"), Swiss Franc ("CHF"), Chinese Yuan ("CNY"), Euro ("EUR"), Pound Sterling ("GBP"), Indian Rupee ("INR"), Japanese Yen ("JPY"), South Korean Won ("KRW"), and New Taiwan Dollar ("TWD"). Our purchasing and sales activities are primarily denominated in USD, CNY, EUR, and JPY. The change in these key currency rates during the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities except for our commitment to fund our defined benefit obligation in the amount of $1.0 million per year through 2024. See Note 15. Pension Liability in ITEM 1 "Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements." Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note1. Operation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2015 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our critical accounting estimates, discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in PartII, Item7 of our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2015 , include estimates for allowances for doubtful accounts, determining useful lives for depreciation and amortization, the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, assessing the need for impairment charges for identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, establishing warranty reserves, accounting for income taxes, and assessing excess and obsolete inventories. Such accounting policies and estimates require significant judgments and assumptions to be used in the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on variability in factors affecting these estimates.  Our management discusses the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors at least annually. Our management also internally discusses the adoption of new accounting policies or changes to existing policies at interim dates, as it deems necessary or appropriate.     24
