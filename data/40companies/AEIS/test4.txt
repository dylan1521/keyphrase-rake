NOTESTO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share data) NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ("we," "us," "our," "Advanced Energy," or the "Company") design, manufacture, sell, and support power conversion products that transform electrical power into various usable forms. Our products enable manufacturing processes that use thin films for various products, such as semiconductor devices, flat panel displays, solar cells, architectural glass, optical coating and decorative and functional coating for consumer products. We also supply thermal instrumentation products for advanced temperature control in the thin film process for these same markets. Our power control modules provide power control solutions for industrial applications where heat treatment and processing are used such as glass manufacturing, metal fabrication and treatment, and material and chemical processing. Our high voltage power supplies and modules are used in applications such as semiconductor ion implantation, scanning electron microscopy, chemical analysis such as mass spectrometry and various applications using X-ray technology and electron guns for both analytical and processing applications. Our network of global service support centers provides a recurring revenue opportunity as we offer repair services, conversions, upgrades, and refurbishments and sales of used equipment to companies using our products. As of December 31, 2015, we discontinued the production, engineering, and sales of our solar inverter product line. As such, all solar inverter revenues, costs, assets and liabilities are reported in Discontinued Operations for all periods presented herein. See Note 2. Discontinued Operations. In the opinion of management, the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal, recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of March31, 2017 , and the results of our operations and cash flows for the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 2016 . The Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the fiscal year ended December31, 2016 and other financial information filed with the SEC. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S.GAAP requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that the significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when accounting for items and matters such as allowances for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory, warranty reserves, acquisitions, asset valuations, goodwill, asset life, depreciation, amortization, recoverability of assets, impairments, deferred revenue, stock option and restricted stock grants, taxes, and other provisions are reasonable, based upon information available at the time they are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our accounting policies are described in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2016 . NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standards setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements. Updates to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update ("ASU"). Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued guidance, whether adopted or to be adopted in the future, is not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" and has subsequently issued several supplemental and/or clarifying ASUs (collectively known as "ASC 606"). ASC 606 implements a five step model for how 7  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (in thousands except per share data)  an entity should recognize revenue in order to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and for the interim periods within that year. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods (including reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 16, 2016. Advanced Energy has established a cross-functional implementation team to analyze its current portfolio of customer contracts. The implementation team is also responsible for identifying and implementing changes to existing business processes, controls, and systems in order to support revenue recognition and disclosure under the new standard. Based on our preliminary review of our customer contracts, we expect that revenue with the majority of our customers will continue to be recognized at a point in time, generally upon shipment of products, consistent with our current revenue recognition model. Upon adoption of ASC 606, however,we also believesome ofourrevenuefrom sales of products and servicesto customerswill be recognized over time, rather than at a point in time,due to the terms of certain customer contracts. As such, various balance sheet line items will be impacted. As such, Advanced Energy believes the adoption of ASC606 will have an impact on both the timing of revenue recognition and various line items within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Our team is continuing to evaluate the impact that the adoption will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing reporting. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)," to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within the year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. Advanced Energy is currently assessing and has not yet determined the impact ASU 2016-02 may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTE 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In December 2015, we completed the wind down of engineering, manufacturing and sales of our solar inverter product line (the "inverter business"). Accordingly, the results of our inverter business has been reflected as "Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes" on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented herein. The effect of our sales of extended inverter warranties to our customers continues to be reflected in deferred revenue in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred revenue for extended inverter warranties and the associated costs of warranty service will be reflected in Sales and Cost of goods sold, respectively, from continuing operations in future periods in our Consolidated Statement of Operations, as the deferred revenue is earned and the associated services are rendered. Extended warranties related to the inverter product line are no longer offered. The items included in "Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes" are as follows:     8  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (in thousands except per share data)  Assets and Liabilities of discontinued operations within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised of the following: NOTE 3. INCOME TAXES The following table sets out the tax expense and the effective tax rate for our income from continuing operations: The effective tax rates for the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 2016 are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of the earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates. Our policy is to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. For the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 2016 , the amount of interest and penalties accrued related to our unrecognized tax benefits was not significant. NOTE 4. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of our diluted EPS is similar to the computation of our basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding (using the if-converted and treasury stock methods), if our outstanding stock options and restricted stock units had been converted to common shares, and if such assumed conversion is dilutive. 9  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (in thousands except per share data)  The following is a reconciliation of the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 : The following stock options and restricted stock units were excluded in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive: Stock Buyback In September 2015 our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $150.0 million of our stock over a thirty-month period. As of April24, 2017 , we have $100 million remaining for the repurchase of shares. NOTE 5. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE Our investments with original maturities of more than three months at time of purchase and that are intended to be held for no more than 12 months, are considered marketable securities available for sale. Our marketable securities consist entirely of certificates of deposit as follows: The maturities of our marketable securities available for sale as of March31, 2017 are as follows: The value and liquidity of the marketable securities we hold are affected by market conditions, as well as the ability of the issuers of such securities to make principal and interest payments when due, and the functioning of the markets in which these securities are traded. As of March31, 2017 , we do not believe any of the underlying issuers of our marketable securities are at risk of default. The following tables present information about our marketable securities measured at fair value, on a recurring basis, as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 . The tables indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to 10  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (in thousands except per share data)  determine fair value. We did not have any financial liabilities measured at fair value, on a recurring basis, as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 . There were no transfers in or out of Level1, 2, or 3 fair value measurements during the three months ended  March31, 2017 . NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward currency exchange rate contracts. During the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 2016 , we entered into currency exchange rate forward contracts to attempt to mitigate the exchange rate risk associated with intercompany debt denominated in nonfunctional currencies. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes; however, they tend to offset the fluctuations of our intercompany debt due to foreign currency exchange rate changes. These forward contracts are typically for one month periods. At March31, 2017 we had outstanding Euro forward contracts. We did not have any currency exchange rate contracts outstanding as of December31, 2016 . The notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts at March31, 2017 was $8.6 million and the fair value of these contracts was not significant at March31, 2017 . During the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 2016 the gains and losses recorded related to the foreign currency exchange contracts are as follows: These gains and losses were offset by corresponding gains and losses on the revaluation of the underlying intercompany debt and both are included as a component of Other (expense) income, net , in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the three months ended  March31, 2017 we entered into a foreign currency exchange rate forward contract at a cost of $3.5 million, to mitigate the exchange rate risk associated with a planned acquisition which was not consummated. This derivative instrument was designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. The hedge expired upon maturity and is no longer outstanding at March31, 2017 . The cost of the forward contract is recorded as a component of Other (expense) income, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. NOTE 7. INVENTORIES Our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and computed on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Components of Inventories are as follows: 11  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (in thousands except per share data)  NOTE 8. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are as follows: Depreciation expense included in our income from continuing operations, is as follows: NOTE 9. GOODWILL The following summarizes the changes in goodwill during the three months ended  March31, 2017 : NOTE 10. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Other intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following as of March31, 2017 :      12  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (in thousands except per share data)  Other intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following as of December31, 2016 : Amortization expense relating to other intangible assets included in our income from continuing operations is as follows: Amortization expense related to intangibles for each of the five years 2017 (remaining) through 2021 and thereafter is as follows: NOTE 11. WARRANTIES Provisions of our sales agreements include customary product warranties, ranging from 12 months to 24 months following installation. The estimated cost of warranties is recorded when revenue is recognized and is based upon historical experience by product, configuration and geographic region. We establish accruals for our warranty obligations that are probable to result in future costs. The warranty accrual is included in our Other accrued expenses in our balance sheet. Changes in our product warranty accrual were as follows:    13  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (in thousands except per share data)  NOTE 12. PENSION LIABILITY In connection with the HiTek acquisition on April 12, 2014, we acquired the HiTek Power Limited Pension Scheme ("HPLPS"). The HPLPS has been closed to new participants and additional accruals since 2006. In order to measure the expense and related benefit obligation, various assumptions are made including discount rates used to value the obligation, expected return on plan assets used to fund these expenses and estimated future inflation rates. These assumptions are based on historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. An actuarial analysis is used to measure the expense and liability associated with pension benefits. We are committed to make annual fixed payments of $0.8 million into the HPLPS through April 30, 2024, and then $1.7 million from May 1, 2024 through November 30, 2033. The net pension liability is included in Other long-term liabilities in our balance sheet as follows: The components of the net periodic pension expense for the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: NOTE 13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION We have reserved a total of 2.7 million shares of Advanced Energy's common stock for issuance under the 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units (including deferred stock units), unrestricted stock, and dividend equivalent rights. Any of the awards issued under this Plan may be issued as performance based awards to align compensation awards to the attainment of annual or long-term performance goals. As of March31, 2017 , there were 1.7 million shares available for grant under the 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Stock option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant and have either a time based vesting schedule of three or four years, or a performance based vesting schedule based upon achievement of organizational performance goals over a three year period, and a term of 10 years. The fair value of each award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Restricted stock units ("RSU's") are granted with either a time based vesting schedule of three or four years, or a performance based vesting schedule based upon achievement of organizational performance goals over a three year period. The fair value of each RSU is determined based upon the closing fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards issued and the functional area of the employee receiving the award. Stock-based compensation for the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: 14  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (in thousands except per share data)  A summary of activity for stock option awards during the three months ended  March31, 2017 is as follows: A summary of activity for RSU awards for the three months ended  March31, 2017 is as follows: NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES We have firm purchase commitments and agreements with various suppliers to ensure the availability of components. The obligation as of March31, 2017 is approximately $92.5 million . Our policy with respect to all purchase commitments is to record losses, if any, when they are probable and reasonably estimable. We continuously monitor these commitments for exposure to potential losses and will record a provision for losses when it is deemed necessary. We are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of our business. There have been no material developments in legal proceedings in which we are involved during the three months ended  March31, 2017 . NOTE 15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Members of our Board of Directors hold various executive positions and serve as directors at other companies, including companies that are our customers. Sales to our related party customers for the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Our accounts receivable balance from related party customers with outstanding balances as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 is as follows:  15  ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC.

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER INFORMATION The following table summarizes sales, and percentages of sales, by customers which individually accounted for 10% or more of sales for the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 2016 : The following table summarizes the accounts receivable balances, and percentages of the total accounts receivables, for customers which individually accounted for 10% or more of accounts receivables as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 : Our sales to Applied Materials, Inc. and LAM Research include precision power products used in semiconductor processing and solar and flat panel display. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales or accounts receivable balances during these periods. 16 
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Special Note on Forward-Looking Statements The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Statements in this report that are not historical information are forward-looking statements. For example, statements relating to our beliefs, expectations and plans are forward-looking statements, as are statements that certain actions, conditions or circumstances will continue. The inclusion of words such as "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "can," "may," "might," "continue," "enables," "plan," "intend," "should," "could," "would," "likely," "potential," or "believe," as well as statements that events or circumstances "will" occur or continue, indicate forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such forward-looking statements and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. For additional information regarding factors that may affect our actual financial condition, results of operations and accuracy of our forward-looking statements, see the information under the caption "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2016 . We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason. BUSINESS OVERVIEW We design, manufacture, sell and support precision power products that transform electrical power into various usable forms. Our power conversion products refine, modify and control the raw electrical power from a utility and convert it into power that is predictable, repeatable and customizable. Our products enable thin film manufacturing processes such as plasma enhanced chemical and physical deposition and etch for various semiconductor and industrial products, industrial thermal applications for material and chemical processes, and specialty power for critical industrial applications. We also supply thermal instrumentation products for advanced temperature control in these markets. Our network of global service support centers provides local repair and field service capability in key regions as well as provides upgrades and refurbishment services, and sales of used equipment to businesses that use our products. The markets we serve include:   Semiconductor capital equipment market - Customers in the semiconductor capital equipment market incorporate our products into equipment that make integrated circuits. Our power conversion systems provide the energy to enable thin film processes, such as deposition and etch, and high voltage applications such as ion implant, wafer inspection and metrology.   Our thermal instrumentation products measure the temperature of the processed substrate or the process chamber. Our remote plasma sources deliver ionized gases for reactive chemical processes used in cleaning, surface treatment, and gas abatement. Precise control over the energy delivered to plasma-based processes enables the production of integrated circuits with reduced feature sizes and increased speed and performance.   Industrial power capital market - Our industrial power capital market is comprised of products for Thin Films Industrial Power and Specialty Power applications.   Thin Films Industrial Power applications include glass coating, glass manufacturing, flat panel displays, solar cell manufacturing, and similar thin film manufacturing, including data storage, hard and optical coating.   Specialty Power applications include power control modules for metal fabrication and treatment, and material and chemical processing. Our high voltage industrial applications include scanning electron microscopy, medical equipment, and instrumentation applications such as x-ray and mass spectroscopy, as well as general electron gun sources for scientific and industrial applications. The analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be helpful for understanding our historical performance and relevant trends going forward. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in PartI, Item1 of this report, including the notes thereto. Also included in the following analysis are measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP is provided below. 17 Results of Continuing Operations The following table sets forth certain data, and the percentage of sales each item reflects, derived from our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated: SALES The following tables set forth sales, and percentage of sales, by product group for the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 2016 : Total Sales Sales increased  $46.3 million , or 44.9% , to $149.4 million for the three months ended March31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended March31, 2016 and increased $14.0 million, or 10.3% as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in sales for both periods is primarily due to demand in the semiconductor market driven by accelerated demand and strength in etch, as well continued growth in global services.  Sales in the semiconductor market increased  $34.9 million , or 50.0% for the three months ending March31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended March31, 2016 and increased $7.8 million, or 8.1% as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. Our growth in the semiconductor market has been fueled by our leadership in etch applications, specifically related to advanced memory and transition to 3DNAND, along with advances in logic technology. Sales growth in each of the periods is driven primarily by recent program wins which have moved into production and delivery. Sales in the industrial capital equipment markets increased  $7.6 million , or 46.1% for the three months ended March31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended March31, 2016 and increased $5.1 million, or 26.9% as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in sales is primarily due to the expansion of advanced coating applications. The industrial markets we serve include solar panel, flat panel display, power control modules, data storage, architectural glass, high voltage and other industrial manufacturing markets. Our customers in these markets are primarily global and regional original equipment manufacturers. Global service sales increased  $3.8 million , or 22.5% , for the three months ended March31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended March31, 2016 and increased $1.1 million, or 5.5% as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in global service sales in both periods is due to share gains and growth in the installed base. 18 Backlog Our backlog was $91.9 million at March31, 2017 as compared to $69.2 million at December31, 2016 . Backlog remains strong primarily due to increased demand in the semiconductor and industrial thin film markets. GROSS PROFIT For the three months ended March31, 2017 , gross profit was $78.8 million , or 52.8% of sales as compared to gross profit of $53.5 million , or 51.9% of sales, for the same period in 2016 . The increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to increased volume as the semiconductor capital equipment market remains strong. OPERATING EXPENSE Operating expenses increased  $5.7 million to $35.6 million , or 23.8% of sales, for the three months ending March31, 2017 from $29.8 million , or 29.0% of sales for the same period in 2016 . The following table summarizes our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated: Research and Development We perform research and development of products for new or emerging applications, technological changes to provide higher performance, lower cost, or other attributes that we may expect to advance our customers' products. We believe that continued development of technological applications, as well as enhancements to existing products to support customer requirements, are critical for us to compete in the markets we serve. Accordingly, we devote significant personnel and financial resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, and we expect these investments to continue. Research and development expenses increased  $1.7 million to $12.5 million , or 8.4% of sales, for the three months ended March31, 2017 from $10.8 million , or 10.5% of sales, for the same period in 2016 . The increase in research and development expense is due to our investment in new programs to maintain and increase our technological leadership to provide solutions to our customers' evolving needs. Selling, General and Administrative Our selling expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel, trade shows, advertising, third-party sales representative commissions, and other selling and marketing activities. Our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate, legal, tax, financial, governance, administrative, information systems, and human resource functions in addition to our general management, including acquisition-related activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased  $4.1 million to $22.1 million , or 14.8% of sales for the three months ended March31, 2017 from $18.0 million , or 17.5% of sales, in the same period in 2016 . The increase is primarily driven by higher stock based compensation, performance bonus, and costs associated with business development. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income and expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses on sales of fixed assets, and other miscellaneous items. Other income (expense), net was a loss of $3.2 million for the three months ended March31, 2017 , as compared to a gain of $0.4 million for the same period in 2016 . The loss for the three months ended March31, 2017 was primarily the cost of a currency option that we entered into for a potential offshore acquisition that we have decided not to consummate.  19 Provision for Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision for the three months ended  March31, 2017 of $4.6 million compared to $3.8 million for the three months ended  March31, 2016 . Effective tax rates are 11.5% for the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 15.7% for the three months ended  March31, 2016 . The effective tax rates for the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 2016 are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of the earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof and the geographic composition of our pre-tax income. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust our effective income tax rate accordingly. Results of Discontinued Operations We completed the wind down of our inverter engineering, manufacturing and sales product line in December 2015. Accordingly, the inverter product line is presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented herein. Extended warranties previously sold for the inverter product line are reflected in deferred revenue from continuing operations on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be reflected in continuing operations in future periods as the deferred revenue is earned and the associated services are rendered. Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes are as follows:  Operating income from discontinued operations for the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 2016 reflects the recovery of accounts receivable previously reserved for and the release of product warranty liability. Non-GAAP Results Management uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS to evaluate business performance without the impacts of certain non-cash charges and other charges which are not part of our usual operations. We use these non-GAAP measures to assess performance against business objectives, make business decisions, including developing budgets and forecasting future periods. In addition, management's incentive plans include these non-GAAP measures as criteria for achievements. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. However, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information that enables readers to evaluate our business from the perspective of management. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP results presented below exclude the impact of non-cash related charges, such as the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and restructuring charges, as well as acquisition-related costs and other nonrecurring costs, as they are not indicative of future performance. The tax effect of our non-GAAP adjustments represents the anticipated annual tax rate applied to each non-GAAP adjustment after consideration of their respective book and tax treatments. 20  Impact of Inflation In recent years, inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations. However, we continuously monitor operating price increases, particularly in connection with the supply of component parts used in our manufacturing process. To the extent permitted by competition, we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales prices over time. From time to time, we may also receive pressure from customers to decrease sales prices due to reductions in the cost structure of our products from cost improvement initiatives and decreases in component part prices. Liquidity and Capital Resources LIQUIDITY We believe that adequate liquidity and cash generation is important to the execution of our strategic initiatives. Our ability to fund our operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and product development efforts may depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to future operating performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. Our primary sources of liquidity are our available cash, investments, and cash generated from current operations. At March31, 2017 , we had $322.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that our current and available cash levels, as well as our cash flows from future operations, will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs, levels of capital expenditures, and contractual obligations for the next twelve months. We may seek additional financing from time to time. In September 2015 our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $150.0 million of our stock over a thirty-month period. As of April24, 2017 , we have $100 million remaining for the repurchase of shares. 21 CASH FLOWS A summary of our cash provided by and (used in) operating, investing and financing activities is as follows: 2017 CASH FLOWS COMPARED TO 2016  Net cash provided by operating activities   Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended  March31, 2017 was $40.2 million , as compared to $11.9 million for the same period in 2016 . The increase of $28.3 million in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to improved earnings from operations partially offset by investment in inventory to fund our growth. Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities   Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities for the three months ended  March31, 2017 was $(4.9) million , as compared to $3.0 million the three months ended March 31, 2016 which included $4.5 million of proceeds from marketable securities. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities   Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the three months ended  March31, 2017 was $(1.7) million , as compared to $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 . This is due to a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options coupled with a year over year increase in the repurchase of shares in order to settle taxes due to stock compensation transactions. Effect of currency translation on cash During the three months ended  March31, 2017 , currency translation had a $1.1 million  favorable impact at March 31, 2017 as compared to a $0.5 million  unfavorable impact at March 31, 2016 . Our foreign operations primarily sell product and incur expenses in the related local currency. Exchange rate fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. The functional currencies of our worldwide operations include U.S. dollar ("USD"), Canadian Dollar ("CAD"), Swiss Franc ("CHF"), Chinese Yuan ("CNY"), Euro ("EUR"), Pound Sterling ("GBP"), Indian Rupee ("INR"), Japanese Yen ("JPY"), South Korean Won ("KRW"), and New 22 Taiwan Dollar ("TWD"). Our purchasing and sales activities are primarily denominated in USD, CNY, EUR, and JPY. The change in these key currency rates during the three months ended  March31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note1. Operation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2016 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our critical accounting estimates, discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in PartII, Item7 of our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2016 , include estimates for allowances for doubtful accounts, determining useful lives for depreciation and amortization, the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, assessing the need for impairment charges for identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, establishing warranty reserves, accounting for income taxes, and assessing excess and obsolete inventories. Such accounting policies and estimates require significant judgments and assumptions to be used in the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on variability in factors affecting these estimates.  Our management discusses the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors at least annually. Our management also internally discusses the adoption of new accounting policies or changes to existing policies at interim dates, as it deems necessary or appropriate.
