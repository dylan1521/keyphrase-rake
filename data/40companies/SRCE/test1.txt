ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management's discussion and analysis is presented to provide information concerning 1st Source Corporation and its subsidiaries' (collectively referred to as "the Company", "we", and "our") financial condition as of March31, 2016 , as compared to December31, 2015 , and the results of operations for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 .

Total loans and leases were $4.03 billion, an increase of $37.28 million or 0.93% from December31, 2015 . Total investment securities, available for sale were $801.95 million which represented an increase of $10.22 million and total deposits were $4.23 billion, an increase of $85.96 million or 2.08% over the comparable figures at the end of 2015 . Short-term borrowings were $181.91 million, a decrease of $51.32 million or 22.00% from December31, 2015 . Nonperforming assets at March31, 2016 were $21.35 million, an increase of $0.73 million or 3.54% from the $20.62 million reported at December31, 2015 . At March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 , nonperforming assets were 0.51% and 0.50%, respectively of net loans and leases. The following table shows accrued income and other assets.  CAPITAL As of March31, 2016 , total shareholders' equity was $649.97 million, up $5.92 million or 0.92% from the $644.05 million at December31, 2015 . In addition to net income of $13.82 million, other significant changes in shareholders' equity during the first three months of 2016 included $8.01 million of common stock acquired for treasury and $4.71 million of dividends paid. The accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) component of shareholders' equity totaled $9.30 million at March31, 2016 , compared to $6.56 million at December31, 2015 . The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) during 2016 was the result of changes in unrealized gain/(loss) on securities in the available-for-sale portfolio. Our equity-to-assets ratio was 12.39% as of March31, 2016 , compared to 12.41% at December31, 2015 . Book value per common share rose to $25.14 at March31, 2016 , from $24.75 at December31, 2015 . We distributed a 10% stock dividend to shareholders of record on August 4, 2015, issuing 2,591,995 shares on August 14, 2015. All share and per share information in this report has been adjusted to reflect the stock dividend, unless otherwise noted. We declared and paid cash dividends per common share of $0.18 during the first quarter of 2016 . The trailing four quarters dividend payout ratio, representing cash dividends per common share divided by diluted earnings per common share, was 31.32%. The dividend payout is continually reviewed by management and the Board of Directors subject to the Company's capital and dividend policy. The banking regulators have established guidelines for leverage capital requirements, expressed in terms of Tier 1 or core capital as a percentage of average assets, to measure the soundness of a financial institution. In addition, banking regulators have established risk-based capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. Under the final capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, there was a requirement for a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule. Institutions that do not maintain this required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital buffer requirement is being phased in over three years beginning in 2016. We have included the 0.625% increase for 2016 in our minimum capital adequacy ratios in the table below. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5%, and the total capital ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis on January 1, 2019. Management believes that, as of March 31, 2016, 1st Source and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis as if all such requirements were currently in effect. 29 The actual capital amounts and ratios of 1st Source Corporation and 1st Source Bank as of March31, 2016 , are presented in the table below. LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY Effective liquidity management ensures that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as our operating cash needs are met. Funds are available from a number of sources, including the securities portfolio, the core deposit base, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings, Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) borrowings, and the capability to package loans for sale. We have borrowing sources available to supplement deposits and meet our funding needs. 1st Source Bank has established relationships with several banks to provide short term borrowings in the form of federal funds purchased. At March31, 2016 , we had no outstandings and could borrow approximately $265.00 million for a short time from these banks on a collective basis. As of March31, 2016 , we had $47.89 million outstanding in FHLB advances and could borrow an additional $185.42 million. We also had $415.92 million available to borrow from the FRB with no amounts outstanding as of March31, 2016 . Our loan to asset ratio was 76.86% at March31, 2016 compared to 77.00% at December31, 2015 and 76.12% at March31, 2015 . Cash and cash equivalents totaled $85.23 million at March31, 2016 compared to $79.72 million at December31, 2015 and $69.26 million at March31, 2015 . At March31, 2016 , the Statement of Financial Condition was rate sensitive by $700.70 million more assets than liabilities scheduled to reprice within one year, or approximately 1.37%. Management believes that the present funding sources provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash flow needs. Under Indiana law governing the collateralization of public fund deposits, the Indiana Board of Depositories determines which financial institutions are required to pledge collateral based on the strength of their financial ratings. We have been informed that no collateral is required for our public fund deposits. However, the Board of Depositories could alter this requirement in the future and adversely impact our liquidity. Our potential liquidity exposure if we must pledge collateral is approximately $498 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net income for the three month period ended March31, 2016 was $13.82 million, compared to $13.51 million for the same period in 2015 . Diluted net income per common share was $0.53 for the three month period ended March31, 2016 , compared to $0.51 for the same period in 2015 . Return on average common shareholders' equity was 8.56% for the three months ended March31, 2016 , compared to 8.79% in 2015 . The return on total average assets was 1.07% for the three months ended March31, 2016 , compared to 1.14% in 2015 . Net income increased for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the first three months of 2015 . Net interest income and noninterest income increased offset by an increase in provision for loan and lease losses, noninterest expense and income tax expense. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below. NET INTEREST INCOME Quarter Ended March 31, 2016 compared to the Quarter Ended December 31, 2015 The taxable equivalent net interest income for the three months ended March31, 2016 was $41.75 million, a decrease of 4.39% over the three months ended December31, 2015 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.45% for the three months ended March31, 2016 , compared to 3.61% for the three months ended December31, 2015 . 30 During the three month period ended March31, 2016 , average earning assets increased $71.22 million or 1.49% over the three months ended December31, 2015 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $74.38 million or 2.11% for the three month period ended March31, 2016 over the three months ended December31, 2015 . The yield on average earning assets decreased 10 basis points to 3.91% for the first quarter of 2016 from 4.01% for the fourth quarter of 2015 . Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 7 basis points to 0.61% for the first quarter of 2016 from 0.54% for the fourth quarter 2015 . The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was a decrease of 16 basis points for the three month period ended March31, 2016 from December31, 2015 . The largest contributor to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets for the three months ended March31, 2016 , compared to the three months ended December31, 2015 , was a reduction in yields on net loans and leases of 12 basis points. The reduction in yields on net loans and leases was primarily the result of fourth quarter net interest recoveries being higher by $1.66 million, which related to one commercial loan relationship. Average net loans and leases increased $48.97 million or 1.24% for the first quarter of 2016 from the fourth quarter of 2015 . Total average investment securities increased $8.95 million or 1.14% for the first quarter over the fourth quarter of 2015 . Average mortgages held for sale increased $0.75 million or 8.88% for the three month period ended March31, 2016 , over the fourth quarter of 2015 . Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and commercial paper, increased $12.56 million or 32.39% for the three month period ended March31, 2016 , over the fourth quarter of 2015 . Average interest-bearing deposits increased $61.02 million or 1.91% for the first quarter of 2016 over the fourth quarter of 2015 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits increased 7 basis points to 0.47% for the first quarter 2016 compared to 0.40% for the fourth quarter 2015 . The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits during the first three months of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily the result of higher rates on certificates of deposit and accelerated discount amortization from called brokered certificates of deposit during the first quarter of 2016. Average short-term borrowings increased $8.28 million or 3.71% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the three months ended December31, 2015 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 10 basis points for the first quarter of 2016 . The increase in short-term borrowings during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the three months ended December31, 2015 was primarily the result of changes in borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB). Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $5.09 million or 8.87% during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 . Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased 40 basis points for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 . The increase during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 was due to higher rates on mandatorily redeemable securities. Quarter Ended March 31, 2016 compared to the Quarter Ended March 31, 2015 The taxable equivalent net interest income for the three months ended March31, 2016 was $41.75 million, an increase of 4.76% over the same period in 2015 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.45% for the three months ended March31, 2016 , compared to 3.58% for the three months ended March31, 2015 . During the three month period ended March31, 2016 , average earning assets increased $352.31 million or 7.81% over the comparable period in 2015 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $242.39 million or 7.20% for the three month period ended March31, 2016 over the comparable period one year ago. The yield on average earning assets decreased 5 basis points to 3.91% for the first quarter of 2016 from 3.96% for the first quarter of 2015 . Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 10 basis points to 0.61% for the first quarter of 2016 from 0.51% for the first quarter 2015 . The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was a decrease of 13 basis points for the three month period ended March31, 2016 from March31, 2015 . The largest contributor to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets for the three months ended March31, 2016 , compared to the three months ended March31, 2015 , was a reduction in yields on net loans and leases of 7 basis points due to market conditions. Average net loans and leases increased $334.35 million or 9.10% for the first quarter of 2016 from the first quarter of 2015 . Total average investment securities increased $6.29 million or 0.80% for the first quarter over one year ago. Average mortgages held for sale decreased $3.87 million or 29.75% for the three month period ended March31, 2016 , over the comparable period a year ago. Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and commercial paper, increased $15.54 million or 43.38% for the three month period ended March31, 2016 , over the comparable period a year ago. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $225.08 million or 7.43% for the first quarter of 2016 over the same period in 2015 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits increased 13 basis points to 0.47% for the first quarter 2016 compared to 0.34% for the first quarter 2015 . The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits during the first three months of 2016 as compared to the first three months of 2015 was primarily the result of higher rates on certificates of deposit and accelerated discount amortization on called brokered certificates of deposit during the first quarter of 2016. 31 Average short-term borrowings increased $11.53 million or 5.24% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 9 basis points for the first quarter of 2016 . The increase in short-term borrowings during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily the result of changes in borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB). Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $5.78 million or 10.18% during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015 . Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities decreased 5 basis points for the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2015 . The decrease during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was due to lower rates on mandatorily redeemable securities. The following table provides an analysis of net interest income and illustrates the interest income earned and interest expense charged for each major component of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Yields/rates are computed on a tax-equivalent basis, using a 35% rate. Nonaccrual loans and leases are included in the average loan and lease balance outstanding.  DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL PROVISION AND RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES  The provision for loan and lease losses for the three month period ended March31, 2016 was $0.98 million compared to a provision for loan and lease losses in the three month period ended March31, 2015 of $0.36 million. Net recoveries of $0.21 million were recorded for the first quarter 2016 , compared to net charge-offs of $0.33 million for the same quarter a year ago. 32 Weaknesses negatively impacting the U.S. recovery, are geopolitical events. Current concerns include the unrelenting decline in oil prices, the continued slowdown in China, the weak EU economies, the recessionary pressures in Japan and Brazil (with the resultant decline in the value of the real), and the heightened concerns of terrorist attacks. We include a factor in our loss ratios for the global risk, as we are increasingly aware of the threat that global concerns may affect our customers. While we are unable to determine with any precision the impact of global economic and political issues on our loan portfolios, we feel the risks are real and significant. We believe there is a risk of negative consequences for our borrowers that would affect their ability to repay their financial obligations. Therefore, we continue to include a factor for global risk in our analysis for the first quarter of 2016. Another area of concern continues to be our aircraft portfolio where we have collateral concentration and $209 million in foreign exposure. The aircraft industry was among the sectors affected most by the sluggish economy. We have seen some evidence that depressed private jet markets have stabilized. As the U.S. economy slowly improves, the industry is likely to benefit and we should see a decrease in the fleet of unsold pre-owned aircraft which will result in further strengthening of values. Nevertheless, we remain concerned about the prolonged low prices for several models. We also have some foreign exposure in this portfolio, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. Brazil is suffering from their worst recession in twenty-five years. We continue to monitor individual customer performance and assess risks in the portfolio as a whole. We do not see a clear trend of improvement or deterioration. We have assessed our reserve ratios, which were established based on the higher and more volatile loss histories and believe our reserve ratios remain appropriate. On March31, 2016 , 30 day and over loan and lease delinquencies were 0.28% compared to 0.40% on March31, 2015 . The decrease in delinquencies is largely attributable to the aircraft portfolio. The reserve for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding at the end of the period was 2.21% as compared to 2.30% one year ago. A summary of loan and lease loss experience during the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 is located in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. A loan or lease is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. We evaluate loans and leases exceeding $100,000 for impairment and establish a specific reserve as a component of the reserve for loan and lease losses when it is probable all amounts due will not be collected pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan or lease and the recorded investment in the loan or lease exceeds its fair value. A summary of impaired loans as of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 is reflected in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. NONPERFORMING ASSETS  The following table shows nonperforming assets.  Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and leases were 0.51% at March31, 2016 , 0.50% at December31, 2015 , and 0.73% at March31, 2015 . Nonperforming assets totaled $21.35 million at March31, 2016 , an increase of 3.54% from the $20.62 million reported at December31, 2015 , and a 22.94% decrease from the $27.71 million reported at March31, 2015 . The increase in nonperforming assets during the first three months of 2016 was related to an increase in loans and leases past due 90 days or more, nonaccrual loans and leases and repossessions offset by sales of other real estate. The decrease in nonperforming assets at March31, 2016 from March31, 2015 occurred primarily in nonaccrual loans and leases and the sale of other real estate. The increase in loans past due 90 days or more at March31, 2016 from December31, 2015 primarily occurred in the residential real estate and home equity portfolio. The increase in nonaccrual loans and leases at March31, 2016 from December31, 2015 occurred primarily in the commercial real estate and consumer portfolios. The decrease in nonaccrual loans and leases at March31, 2016 from March31, 2015 occurred primarily in the aircraft, commercial and commercial real estate portfolios. A summary of nonaccrual loans and leases and past due aging for the period ended March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 is located in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other real estate is the result of foreclosing on real estate in the local market for which we have a current appraisal and are well secured. Other real estate decreased over the past year due to current sales of existing properties outpacing current foreclosures. 33 Repossessions consisted mainly of aircraft financing. At the time of repossession, the recorded amount of the loan or lease is written down to the fair value of the equipment or vehicle by a charge to the reserve for loan and lease losses or other income, if a positive adjustment, unless the equipment is in the process of immediate sale. Any subsequent fair value write-downs or write-ups, to the extent of previous write-downs, are included in noninterest expense. The following table shows a summary of other real estate and repossessions.  For financial statement purposes, nonaccrual loans and leases are included in loan and lease outstandings, whereas repossessions and other real estate are included in other assets. Foreign Outstandings - Our foreign loan and lease outstandings, all denominated in U.S. dollars were $208.70 million and $205.83 million as of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 , respectively. Foreign loans and leases are in aircraft financing. Loan and lease outstandings to borrowers in Brazil and Mexico were $81.64 million and $115.09 million as of March31, 2016 , respectively, compared to $76.79 million and $116.73 million as of December31, 2015 , respectively. As of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 there was not a significant concentration in any other country. NONINTEREST INCOME  The following table shows the details of noninterest income.  NM = Not Meaningful Trust fees increased slightly for the three months ended March31, 2016 over the same period a year ago. Trust fees are largely based on the number and size of client relationships and the market value of assets under management. The market value of trust assets under management at March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 was $3.89 billion and $3.78 billion, respectively. Service charges on deposit accounts declined for the three months ended March31, 2016 over the comparable period one year ago. The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts primarily reflects a lower volume of nonsufficient fund transactions and a decrease in paper statement fees as clients continue to move to online access for account statements. Debit card income increased in the three months ended March31, 2016 over the same period a year ago. The improvement in debit card income was mainly the result of an increased volume of debit card transactions in 2016 . 34 Mortgage banking income decreased in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015 . This variance was primarily caused by decreased gains on loan sales and lower secondary market loan production offset by a reduction in MSR amortization expense. Insurance commissions increased during the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . The increase in insurance commissions was primarily due to higher contingency commissions received during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. Equipment rental income grew for the three months ended March31, 2016 over the comparable period one year ago. The increase was the result of the average equipment rental portfolio increasing 34.42% over the same period a year ago due to improving market conditions for equipment finance mainly in construction equipment, auto and light trucks and medium and heavy duty trucks. The increase in equipment rental income was offset by a similar increase in depreciation on equipment owned under operating leases. Gains on investment securities available-for-sale were flat during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 . Other income increased for the three months ended March31, 2016 over the same period a year ago. The higher income during the first three months of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago was mainly due to gains on partnership investments, increased customer swap fees and higher mutual fund income offset by lower monogram fund income. NONINTEREST EXPENSE  The following table shows the details of noninterest expense.  Salaries and employee benefits increased for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . The increase for the first quarter 2016 was mainly due to higher base salary expense offset by lower group insurance costs. Higher base salary expense was primarily due to more full-time equivalent employees as a result of opening a new banking center in June 2015, filling other open positions and normal performance raises. Group insurance costs decreased as a result of lower health insurance claims experience. Net occupancy expense increased slightly during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Furniture and equipment expense, including depreciation, increased during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Furniture and equipment expense was higher in 2016 mainly due to increased computer processing charges, software and equipment maintenance costs and depreciation. During the first quarter of 2016 , depreciation on leased equipment increased in conjunction with the increase in equipment rental income as compared to the same period one year ago. Professional fees grew during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. Professional fees increased in 2016 primarily due to higher legal fees and increased utilization of consulting services offset by lower audit fees. Supplies and communication expense increased for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . The increase in 2016 was mainly the result of continuing to replace debit cards with the new embedded EMV chip technology. FDIC and other insurance increased slightly during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. 35 Business development and marketing expense decreased for the three months ended March31, 2016 versus the three months ended March31, 2015 . The lower expense in 2016 was primarily the result of decreased marketing promotions. Loan and lease collection and repossession expense increased for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to fewer gains on the sale of other real estate and repossessions offset by decreased valuation adjustments and lower collection and repossession expenses. Other expenses were higher during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 . The increase during the first quarter of 2016 over a year ago primarily related to higher provision on unfunded loan commitments and swap valuation adjustments offset by lower expenses related to a previously reported proceeding that involved the Bank as trustee and reduced intangible asset amortization as items fully amortize. INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes for the three month period ended March31, 2016 was $7.42 million compared to $7.26 million for the same period in 2015 . The effective tax rates were 34.93% and 34.95% for the first quarter ended March31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
