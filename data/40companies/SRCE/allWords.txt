ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management's discussion and analysis is presented to provide information concerning 1st Source Corporation and its subsidiaries' (collectively referred to as "the Company", "we", and "our") financial condition as of March31, 2016 , as compared to December31, 2015 , and the results of operations for the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 . This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the financial and statistical data appearing elsewhere in this report and our 2015 Annual Report. Except for historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this document express "forward-looking statements." Generally, the words "believe," "contemplate," "seek," "plan," "possible," "assume," "expect," "intend," "targeted," "continue," "remain," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "will," "should," "indicate," "would," "may" and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Those statements, including statements, projections, estimates or assumptions concerning future events or performance, and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact, are subject to material risks and uncertainties. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We may make other written or oral forward-looking statements from time to time. Readers are advised that various important factors could cause our actual results or circumstances for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, changes in law, regulations or GAAP; our competitive position within the markets we serve; increasing consolidation within the banking industry; unforeseen changes in interest rates; unforeseen changes in loan prepayment assumptions; unforeseen downturns in or major events affecting the local, regional or national economies or the industries in which we have credit concentrations; and other matters discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form10-K for 2015 , which filings are available from the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. 28 FINANCIAL CONDITION Our total assets at March31, 2016 were $5.25 billion, an increase of $57.69 million or 1.11% from December31, 2015 . Total loans and leases were $4.03 billion, an increase of $37.28 million or 0.93% from December31, 2015 . Total investment securities, available for sale were $801.95 million which represented an increase of $10.22 million and total deposits were $4.23 billion, an increase of $85.96 million or 2.08% over the comparable figures at the end of 2015 . Short-term borrowings were $181.91 million, a decrease of $51.32 million or 22.00% from December31, 2015 . Nonperforming assets at March31, 2016 were $21.35 million, an increase of $0.73 million or 3.54% from the $20.62 million reported at December31, 2015 . At March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 , nonperforming assets were 0.51% and 0.50%, respectively of net loans and leases. The following table shows accrued income and other assets. CAPITAL As of March31, 2016 , total shareholders' equity was $649.97 million, up $5.92 million or 0.92% from the $644.05 million at December31, 2015 . In addition to net income of $13.82 million, other significant changes in shareholders' equity during the first three months of 2016 included $8.01 million of common stock acquired for treasury and $4.71 million of dividends paid. The accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) component of shareholders' equity totaled $9.30 million at March31, 2016 , compared to $6.56 million at December31, 2015 . The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) during 2016 was the result of changes in unrealized gain/(loss) on securities in the available-for-sale portfolio. Our equity-to-assets ratio was 12.39% as of March31, 2016 , compared to 12.41% at December31, 2015 . Book value per common share rose to $25.14 at March31, 2016 , from $24.75 at December31, 2015 . We distributed a 10% stock dividend to shareholders of record on August 4, 2015, issuing 2,591,995 shares on August 14, 2015. All share and per share information in this report has been adjusted to reflect the stock dividend, unless otherwise noted. We declared and paid cash dividends per common share of $0.18 during the first quarter of 2016 . The trailing four quarters dividend payout ratio, representing cash dividends per common share divided by diluted earnings per common share, was 31.32%. The dividend payout is continually reviewed by management and the Board of Directors subject to the Company's capital and dividend policy. The banking regulators have established guidelines for leverage capital requirements, expressed in terms of Tier 1 or core capital as a percentage of average assets, to measure the soundness of a financial institution. In addition, banking regulators have established risk-based capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. Under the final capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, there was a requirement for a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule. Institutions that do not maintain this required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital buffer requirement is being phased in over three years beginning in 2016. We have included the 0.625% increase for 2016 in our minimum capital adequacy ratios in the table below. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5%, and the total capital ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis on January 1, 2019. Management believes that, as of March 31, 2016, 1st Source and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis as if all such requirements were currently in effect. 29 The actual capital amounts and ratios of 1st Source Corporation and 1st Source Bank as of March31, 2016 , are presented in the table below. LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY Effective liquidity management ensures that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as our operating cash needs are met. Funds are available from a number of sources, including the securities portfolio, the core deposit base, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings, Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) borrowings, and the capability to package loans for sale. We have borrowing sources available to supplement deposits and meet our funding needs. 1st Source Bank has established relationships with several banks to provide short term borrowings in the form of federal funds purchased. At March31, 2016 , we had no outstandings and could borrow approximately $265.00 million for a short time from these banks on a collective basis. As of March31, 2016 , we had $47.89 million outstanding in FHLB advances and could borrow an additional $185.42 million. We also had $415.92 million available to borrow from the FRB with no amounts outstanding as of March31, 2016 . Our loan to asset ratio was 76.86% at March31, 2016 compared to 77.00% at December31, 2015 and 76.12% at March31, 2015 . Cash and cash equivalents totaled $85.23 million at March31, 2016 compared to $79.72 million at December31, 2015 and $69.26 million at March31, 2015 . At March31, 2016 , the Statement of Financial Condition was rate sensitive by $700.70 million more assets than liabilities scheduled to reprice within one year, or approximately 1.37%. Management believes that the present funding sources provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash flow needs. Under Indiana law governing the collateralization of public fund deposits, the Indiana Board of Depositories determines which financial institutions are required to pledge collateral based on the strength of their financial ratings. We have been informed that no collateral is required for our public fund deposits. However, the Board of Depositories could alter this requirement in the future and adversely impact our liquidity. Our potential liquidity exposure if we must pledge collateral is approximately $498 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net income for the three month period ended March31, 2016 was $13.82 million, compared to $13.51 million for the same period in 2015 . Diluted net income per common share was $0.53 for the three month period ended March31, 2016 , compared to $0.51 for the same period in 2015 . Return on average common shareholders' equity was 8.56% for the three months ended March31, 2016 , compared to 8.79% in 2015 . The return on total average assets was 1.07% for the three months ended March31, 2016 , compared to 1.14% in 2015 . Net income increased for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the first three months of 2015 . Net interest income and noninterest income increased offset by an increase in provision for loan and lease losses, noninterest expense and income tax expense. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below. NET INTEREST INCOME Quarter Ended March 31, 2016 compared to the Quarter Ended December 31, 2015 The taxable equivalent net interest income for the three months ended March31, 2016 was $41.75 million, a decrease of 4.39% over the three months ended December31, 2015 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.45% for the three months ended March31, 2016 , compared to 3.61% for the three months ended December31, 2015 . 30 During the three month period ended March31, 2016 , average earning assets increased $71.22 million or 1.49% over the three months ended December31, 2015 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $74.38 million or 2.11% for the three month period ended March31, 2016 over the three months ended December31, 2015 . The yield on average earning assets decreased 10 basis points to 3.91% for the first quarter of 2016 from 4.01% for the fourth quarter of 2015 . Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 7 basis points to 0.61% for the first quarter of 2016 from 0.54% for the fourth quarter 2015 . The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was a decrease of 16 basis points for the three month period ended March31, 2016 from December31, 2015 . The largest contributor to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets for the three months ended March31, 2016 , compared to the three months ended December31, 2015 , was a reduction in yields on net loans and leases of 12 basis points. The reduction in yields on net loans and leases was primarily the result of fourth quarter net interest recoveries being higher by $1.66 million, which related to one commercial loan relationship. Average net loans and leases increased $48.97 million or 1.24% for the first quarter of 2016 from the fourth quarter of 2015 . Total average investment securities increased $8.95 million or 1.14% for the first quarter over the fourth quarter of 2015 . Average mortgages held for sale increased $0.75 million or 8.88% for the three month period ended March31, 2016 , over the fourth quarter of 2015 . Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and commercial paper, increased $12.56 million or 32.39% for the three month period ended March31, 2016 , over the fourth quarter of 2015 . Average interest-bearing deposits increased $61.02 million or 1.91% for the first quarter of 2016 over the fourth quarter of 2015 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits increased 7 basis points to 0.47% for the first quarter 2016 compared to 0.40% for the fourth quarter 2015 . The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits during the first three months of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily the result of higher rates on certificates of deposit and accelerated discount amortization from called brokered certificates of deposit during the first quarter of 2016. Average short-term borrowings increased $8.28 million or 3.71% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the three months ended December31, 2015 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 10 basis points for the first quarter of 2016 . The increase in short-term borrowings during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the three months ended December31, 2015 was primarily the result of changes in borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB). Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $5.09 million or 8.87% during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 . Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased 40 basis points for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 . The increase during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 was due to higher rates on mandatorily redeemable securities. Quarter Ended March 31, 2016 compared to the Quarter Ended March 31, 2015 The taxable equivalent net interest income for the three months ended March31, 2016 was $41.75 million, an increase of 4.76% over the same period in 2015 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.45% for the three months ended March31, 2016 , compared to 3.58% for the three months ended March31, 2015 . During the three month period ended March31, 2016 , average earning assets increased $352.31 million or 7.81% over the comparable period in 2015 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $242.39 million or 7.20% for the three month period ended March31, 2016 over the comparable period one year ago. The yield on average earning assets decreased 5 basis points to 3.91% for the first quarter of 2016 from 3.96% for the first quarter of 2015 . Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 10 basis points to 0.61% for the first quarter of 2016 from 0.51% for the first quarter 2015 . The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was a decrease of 13 basis points for the three month period ended March31, 2016 from March31, 2015 . The largest contributor to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets for the three months ended March31, 2016 , compared to the three months ended March31, 2015 , was a reduction in yields on net loans and leases of 7 basis points due to market conditions. Average net loans and leases increased $334.35 million or 9.10% for the first quarter of 2016 from the first quarter of 2015 . Total average investment securities increased $6.29 million or 0.80% for the first quarter over one year ago. Average mortgages held for sale decreased $3.87 million or 29.75% for the three month period ended March31, 2016 , over the comparable period a year ago. Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and commercial paper, increased $15.54 million or 43.38% for the three month period ended March31, 2016 , over the comparable period a year ago. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $225.08 million or 7.43% for the first quarter of 2016 over the same period in 2015 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits increased 13 basis points to 0.47% for the first quarter 2016 compared to 0.34% for the first quarter 2015 . The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits during the first three months of 2016 as compared to the first three months of 2015 was primarily the result of higher rates on certificates of deposit and accelerated discount amortization on called brokered certificates of deposit during the first quarter of 2016. 31 Average short-term borrowings increased $11.53 million or 5.24% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 9 basis points for the first quarter of 2016 . The increase in short-term borrowings during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily the result of changes in borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB). Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $5.78 million or 10.18% during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015 . Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities decreased 5 basis points for the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2015 . The decrease during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was due to lower rates on mandatorily redeemable securities. The following table provides an analysis of net interest income and illustrates the interest income earned and interest expense charged for each major component of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Yields/rates are computed on a tax-equivalent basis, using a 35% rate. Nonaccrual loans and leases are included in the average loan and lease balance outstanding. DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL PROVISION AND RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES The provision for loan and lease losses for the three month period ended March31, 2016 was $0.98 million compared to a provision for loan and lease losses in the three month period ended March31, 2015 of $0.36 million. Net recoveries of $0.21 million were recorded for the first quarter 2016 , compared to net charge-offs of $0.33 million for the same quarter a year ago. 32 Weaknesses negatively impacting the U.S. recovery, are geopolitical events. Current concerns include the unrelenting decline in oil prices, the continued slowdown in China, the weak EU economies, the recessionary pressures in Japan and Brazil (with the resultant decline in the value of the real), and the heightened concerns of terrorist attacks. We include a factor in our loss ratios for the global risk, as we are increasingly aware of the threat that global concerns may affect our customers. While we are unable to determine with any precision the impact of global economic and political issues on our loan portfolios, we feel the risks are real and significant. We believe there is a risk of negative consequences for our borrowers that would affect their ability to repay their financial obligations. Therefore, we continue to include a factor for global risk in our analysis for the first quarter of 2016. Another area of concern continues to be our aircraft portfolio where we have collateral concentration and $209 million in foreign exposure. The aircraft industry was among the sectors affected most by the sluggish economy. We have seen some evidence that depressed private jet markets have stabilized. As the U.S. economy slowly improves, the industry is likely to benefit and we should see a decrease in the fleet of unsold pre-owned aircraft which will result in further strengthening of values. Nevertheless, we remain concerned about the prolonged low prices for several models. We also have some foreign exposure in this portfolio, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. Brazil is suffering from their worst recession in twenty-five years. We continue to monitor individual customer performance and assess risks in the portfolio as a whole. We do not see a clear trend of improvement or deterioration. We have assessed our reserve ratios, which were established based on the higher and more volatile loss histories and believe our reserve ratios remain appropriate. On March31, 2016 , 30 day and over loan and lease delinquencies were 0.28% compared to 0.40% on March31, 2015 . The decrease in delinquencies is largely attributable to the aircraft portfolio. The reserve for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding at the end of the period was 2.21% as compared to 2.30% one year ago. A summary of loan and lease loss experience during the three months ended March31, 2016 and 2015 is located in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. A loan or lease is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. We evaluate loans and leases exceeding $100,000 for impairment and establish a specific reserve as a component of the reserve for loan and lease losses when it is probable all amounts due will not be collected pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan or lease and the recorded investment in the loan or lease exceeds its fair value. A summary of impaired loans as of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 is reflected in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. NONPERFORMING ASSETS The following table shows nonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and leases were 0.51% at March31, 2016 , 0.50% at December31, 2015 , and 0.73% at March31, 2015 . Nonperforming assets totaled $21.35 million at March31, 2016 , an increase of 3.54% from the $20.62 million reported at December31, 2015 , and a 22.94% decrease from the $27.71 million reported at March31, 2015 . The increase in nonperforming assets during the first three months of 2016 was related to an increase in loans and leases past due 90 days or more, nonaccrual loans and leases and repossessions offset by sales of other real estate. The decrease in nonperforming assets at March31, 2016 from March31, 2015 occurred primarily in nonaccrual loans and leases and the sale of other real estate. The increase in loans past due 90 days or more at March31, 2016 from December31, 2015 primarily occurred in the residential real estate and home equity portfolio. The increase in nonaccrual loans and leases at March31, 2016 from December31, 2015 occurred primarily in the commercial real estate and consumer portfolios. The decrease in nonaccrual loans and leases at March31, 2016 from March31, 2015 occurred primarily in the aircraft, commercial and commercial real estate portfolios. A summary of nonaccrual loans and leases and past due aging for the period ended March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 is located in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other real estate is the result of foreclosing on real estate in the local market for which we have a current appraisal and are well secured. Other real estate decreased over the past year due to current sales of existing properties outpacing current foreclosures. 33 Repossessions consisted mainly of aircraft financing. At the time of repossession, the recorded amount of the loan or lease is written down to the fair value of the equipment or vehicle by a charge to the reserve for loan and lease losses or other income, if a positive adjustment, unless the equipment is in the process of immediate sale. Any subsequent fair value write-downs or write-ups, to the extent of previous write-downs, are included in noninterest expense. The following table shows a summary of other real estate and repossessions. For financial statement purposes, nonaccrual loans and leases are included in loan and lease outstandings, whereas repossessions and other real estate are included in other assets. Foreign Outstandings - Our foreign loan and lease outstandings, all denominated in U.S. dollars were $208.70 million and $205.83 million as of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 , respectively. Foreign loans and leases are in aircraft financing. Loan and lease outstandings to borrowers in Brazil and Mexico were $81.64 million and $115.09 million as of March31, 2016 , respectively, compared to $76.79 million and $116.73 million as of December31, 2015 , respectively. As of March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 there was not a significant concentration in any other country. NONINTEREST INCOME The following table shows the details of noninterest income. NM = Not Meaningful Trust fees increased slightly for the three months ended March31, 2016 over the same period a year ago. Trust fees are largely based on the number and size of client relationships and the market value of assets under management. The market value of trust assets under management at March31, 2016 and December31, 2015 was $3.89 billion and $3.78 billion, respectively. Service charges on deposit accounts declined for the three months ended March31, 2016 over the comparable period one year ago. The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts primarily reflects a lower volume of nonsufficient fund transactions and a decrease in paper statement fees as clients continue to move to online access for account statements. Debit card income increased in the three months ended March31, 2016 over the same period a year ago. The improvement in debit card income was mainly the result of an increased volume of debit card transactions in 2016 . 34 Mortgage banking income decreased in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015 . This variance was primarily caused by decreased gains on loan sales and lower secondary market loan production offset by a reduction in MSR amortization expense. Insurance commissions increased during the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . The increase in insurance commissions was primarily due to higher contingency commissions received during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. Equipment rental income grew for the three months ended March31, 2016 over the comparable period one year ago. The increase was the result of the average equipment rental portfolio increasing 34.42% over the same period a year ago due to improving market conditions for equipment finance mainly in construction equipment, auto and light trucks and medium and heavy duty trucks. The increase in equipment rental income was offset by a similar increase in depreciation on equipment owned under operating leases. Gains on investment securities available-for-sale were flat during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 . Other income increased for the three months ended March31, 2016 over the same period a year ago. The higher income during the first three months of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago was mainly due to gains on partnership investments, increased customer swap fees and higher mutual fund income offset by lower monogram fund income. NONINTEREST EXPENSE The following table shows the details of noninterest expense. Salaries and employee benefits increased for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . The increase for the first quarter 2016 was mainly due to higher base salary expense offset by lower group insurance costs. Higher base salary expense was primarily due to more full-time equivalent employees as a result of opening a new banking center in June 2015, filling other open positions and normal performance raises. Group insurance costs decreased as a result of lower health insurance claims experience. Net occupancy expense increased slightly during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Furniture and equipment expense, including depreciation, increased during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Furniture and equipment expense was higher in 2016 mainly due to increased computer processing charges, software and equipment maintenance costs and depreciation. During the first quarter of 2016 , depreciation on leased equipment increased in conjunction with the increase in equipment rental income as compared to the same period one year ago. Professional fees grew during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. Professional fees increased in 2016 primarily due to higher legal fees and increased utilization of consulting services offset by lower audit fees. Supplies and communication expense increased for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . The increase in 2016 was mainly the result of continuing to replace debit cards with the new embedded EMV chip technology. FDIC and other insurance increased slightly during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. 35 Business development and marketing expense decreased for the three months ended March31, 2016 versus the three months ended March31, 2015 . The lower expense in 2016 was primarily the result of decreased marketing promotions. Loan and lease collection and repossession expense increased for the three months ended March31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to fewer gains on the sale of other real estate and repossessions offset by decreased valuation adjustments and lower collection and repossession expenses. Other expenses were higher during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 . The increase during the first quarter of 2016 over a year ago primarily related to higher provision on unfunded loan commitments and swap valuation adjustments offset by lower expenses related to a previously reported proceeding that involved the Bank as trustee and reduced intangible asset amortization as items fully amortize. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes for the three month period ended March31, 2016 was $7.42 million compared to $7.26 million for the same period in 2015 . The effective tax rates were 34.93% and 34.95% for the first quarter ended March31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management's discussion and analysis is presented to provide information concerning 1st Source Corporation and its subsidiaries' (collectively referred to as "the Company", "we", and "our") financial condition as of June30, 2016 , as compared to December31, 2015 , and the results of operations for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015 . This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the financial and statistical data appearing elsewhere in this report and our 2015 Annual Report. Except for historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this document express "forward-looking statements." Generally, the words "believe," "contemplate," "seek," "plan," "possible," "assume," "expect," "intend," "targeted," "continue," "remain," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "will," "should," "indicate," "would," "may" and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Those statements, including statements, projections, estimates or assumptions concerning future events or performance, and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact, are subject to material risks and uncertainties. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We may make other written or oral forward-looking statements from time to time. Readers are advised that various important factors could cause our actual results or circumstances for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, changes in law, regulations or GAAP; our competitive position within the markets we serve; increasing consolidation within the banking industry; unforeseen changes in interest rates; unforeseen changes in loan prepayment assumptions; unforeseen downturns in or major events affecting the local, regional or national economies or the industries in which we have credit concentrations; and other matters discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form10-K for 2015 , which filings are available from the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. 29 FINANCIAL CONDITION Our total assets at June30, 2016 were $5.38 billion, an increase of $192.02 million or 3.70% from December31, 2015 . Total loans and leases were $4.15 billion, an increase of $158.07 million or 3.96% from December31, 2015 . Total investment securities, available for sale were $814.26 million which represented an increase of $22.53 million or 2.85% and equipment owned under operating leases were $119.31 million, an increase of $8.94 million or 8.10% from the comparable figures at December31, 2015 . Total deposits were $4.33 billion, an increase of $185.90 million or 4.49% from the end of 2015 . Short-term borrowings were $205.98 million, a decrease of $27.25 million or 11.69% from December31, 2015 . Nonperforming assets at June30, 2016 were $21.03 million, an increase of $0.41 million or 1.98% from the $20.62 million reported at December31, 2015 . At June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 , nonperforming assets were 0.49% and 0.50%, respectively of net loans and leases. The following table shows accrued income and other assets. CAPITAL As of June30, 2016 , total shareholders' equity was $661.76 million, up $17.70 million or 2.75% from the $644.05 million at December31, 2015 . In addition to net income of $28.30 million, other significant changes in shareholders' equity during the first six months of 2016 included $8.01 million of common stock acquired for treasury and $9.37 million of dividends paid. The accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) component of shareholders' equity totaled $10.83 million at June30, 2016 , compared to $6.56 million at December31, 2015 . The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) during 2016 was the result of changes in unrealized gain/(loss) on securities in the available-for-sale portfolio. Our equity-to-assets ratio was 12.30% as of June30, 2016 , compared to 12.41% at December31, 2015 . Book value per common share rose to $25.59 at June30, 2016 , from $24.75 at December31, 2015 . We declared a 10% stock dividend to shareholders of record on August 4, 2015, issuing 2,591,995 shares on August 14, 2015. All share and per share information in this report has been adjusted to reflect the stock dividend, unless otherwise noted. We declared and paid cash dividends per common share of $0.18 during the second quarter of 2016 . The trailing four quarters dividend payout ratio, representing cash dividends per common share divided by diluted earnings per common share, was 32.57%. The dividend payout is continually reviewed by management and the Board of Directors subject to the Company's capital and dividend policy. The banking regulators have established guidelines for leverage capital requirements, expressed in terms of Tier 1 or core capital as a percentage of average assets, to measure the soundness of a financial institution. In addition, banking regulators have established risk-based capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. Under the final capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, there was a requirement for a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule. Institutions that do not maintain this required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital buffer requirement is being phased in over three years beginning in 2016. We have included the 0.625% increase for 2016 in our minimum capital adequacy ratios in the table below. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5%, and the total capital ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis on January 1, 2019. Management believes that, as of June30, 2016 , 1st Source and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis as if all such requirements were currently in effect. 30 The actual capital amounts and ratios of 1st Source Corporation and 1st Source Bank as of June30, 2016 , are presented in the table below. LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY Effective liquidity management ensures that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as our operating cash needs are met. Funds are available from a number of sources, including the securities portfolio, the core deposit base, access to the national brokered certificates of deposit market, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings, Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) borrowings, and the capability to package loans for sale. We have borrowing sources available to supplement deposits and meet our funding needs. 1st Source Bank has established relationships with several banks to provide short term borrowings in the form of federal funds purchased. At June30, 2016 , we had no outstandings and could borrow approximately $265.00 million for a short time from these banks on a collective basis. As of June30, 2016 , we had $78.60 million outstanding in FHLB advances and could borrow an additional $154.72 million. We also had $479.26 million available to borrow from the FRB with no amounts outstanding as of June30, 2016 . Our loan to asset ratio was 77.19% at June30, 2016 compared to 77.00% at December31, 2015 and 76.84% at June30, 2015 . Cash and cash equivalents totaled $73.24 million at June30, 2016 compared to $79.72 million at December31, 2015 and $77.70 million at June30, 2015 . At June30, 2016 , the Statement of Financial Condition was rate sensitive by $616.05 million more assets than liabilities scheduled to reprice within one year, or approximately 1.29%. Management believes that the present funding sources provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash flow needs. Under Indiana law governing the collateralization of public fund deposits, the Indiana Board of Depositories determines which financial institutions are required to pledge collateral based on the strength of their financial ratings. We have been informed that no collateral is required for our public fund deposits. However, the Board of Depositories could alter this requirement in the future and adversely impact our liquidity. Our potential liquidity exposure if we must pledge collateral is approximately $623 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net income for the three and six month periods ended June30, 2016 was $14.48 million and $28.30 million, compared to $15.63 million and $29.14 million for the same periods in 2015 . Diluted net income per common share was $0.56 and $1.08 for the three and six month periods ended June30, 2016 , compared to $0.59 and $1.10 for the same periods in 2015 . Return on average common shareholders' equity was 8.70% for the six months ended June30, 2016 , compared to 9.36% in 2015 . The return on total average assets was 1.08% for the six months ended June30, 2016 , compared to 1.20% in 2015 . Net income decreased for the six months ended June30, 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015 . Net interest income and noninterest income increased along with a decrease in income tax expense offset by an increase in provision for loan and lease losses and noninterest expense. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below. 31 NET INTEREST INCOME The following tables provide an analysis of net interest income and illustrates the interest income earned and interest expense charged for each major component of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Yields/rates are computed on a tax-equivalent basis, using a 35% rate. Nonaccrual loans and leases are included in the average loan and lease balance outstanding. DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL Quarter Ended June 30, 2016 compared to the Quarter Ended June 30, 2015 The taxable equivalent net interest income for the three months ended June30, 2016 was $42.75 million, an increase of 1.62% over the same period in 2015 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.45% for the three months ended June30, 2016 , compared to 3.64% for the three months ended June30, 2015 . During the three month period ended June30, 2016 , average earning assets increased $352.54 million or 7.61% over the comparable period in 2015 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $258.88 million or 7.50%. The yield on average earning assets decreased 14 basis points to 3.90% from 4.04%. The rate earned on assets decreased primarily due to lower net interest recoveries (as a result of collection efforts on nonaccrual loans) of $1.35 million or 13 basis points largely related to one commercial loan relationship. Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 8 basis points to 0.61% from 0.53%. The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was a decrease of 19 basis points. The largest contributor to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets for the three months ended June30, 2016 , compared to the three months ended June30, 2015 , was a reduction in yields on net loans and leases of 19 basis points due to the aforementioned net interest recoveries in 2015 which impacted the yield on net loans and leases by 15 basis points. Average net loans and leases increased $304.99 million or 8.03%. Total average investment securities increased $13.29 million or 1.68%. Average mortgages held for sale decreased $2.35 million or 17.48%. Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and commercial paper, increased $36.62 million or 126.49%. 32 Average interest-bearing deposits increased $283.59 million or 9.16% for the second quarter of 2016 over the same period in 2015 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits increased 8 basis points to 0.45% from 0.37%. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily the result of higher rates on certificates of deposit. Average short-term borrowings decreased $33.22 million or 13.96% for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 1 basis point. Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $8.51 million or 14.83%. Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased 48 basis points. The increase was due to higher rates on mandatorily redeemable securities. DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 The taxable equivalent net interest income for the six months ended June30, 2016 was $84.50 million, an increase of 3.15% over the comparable period in 2015 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.45% compared to a net interest margin of 3.61% for the same period in 2015 . During the six month period ended June30, 2016 , average earning assets increased $352.09 million or 7.70% over the comparable period in 2015 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $250.39 million or 7.35%. The yield on average earning assets decreased 9 basis points to 3.91% from 4.00%. The rate earned on assets decreased during 2016 over 2015 primarily due to lower net interest recoveries of $1.41 million or 6 basis points largely related to one commercial loan relationship. Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 9 basis points to 0.61% from 0.52%. The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was a decrease of 16 basis points. 33 The largest contributor to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets for the six months ended June30, 2016 , compared to the six months ended June30, 2015 , was a reduction in yields on net loans and leases of 13 basis points due to the aforementioned net interest recoveries in 2015 which impacted the yield on net loans and leases by 8 basis points. Average net loans and leases increased $319.32 million or 8.54%. Total average investment securities increased $9.78 million or 1.24%. Average mortgages held for sale decreased $3.11 million or 23.52%. Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and commercial paper, increased $26.10 million or 80.63%. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $254.15 million or 8.30% for the first six months of 2016 over the same period in 2015 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits increased 10 basis points to 0.46% compared to 0.36%. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily the result of higher rates on certificates of deposit and accelerated discount amortization on called brokered certificates of deposit during the first quarter of 2016 . Average short-term borrowings decreased $10.90 million or 4.76% for the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 5 basis points. The decrease in short-term borrowings was primarily the result of decreased borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB). Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $7.14 million or 12.51%. Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased 22 basis points. The increase was due to higher rates on mandatorily redeemable securities. PROVISION AND RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES The provision for loan and lease losses for the three and six month periods ended June30, 2016 was $2.05 million and $3.02 million compared to a provision for loan and lease losses in the three and six month periods ended June30, 2015 of $0.81 million and $1.17 million respectively. Net recoveries of $0.11 million were recorded for the second quarter 2016 , compared to net recoveries of $0.68 million for the same quarter a year ago. Year-to-date net recoveries of $0.32 million have been recorded in 2016 , compared to net recoveries of $0.35 million through June30, 2015 . Weaknesses negatively impacting the U.S. recovery, are geopolitical events. Current concerns include Brexit which will likely result in greater volatility in the EU and additional upward pressure on the dollar negatively impacting exports, the continued slowdown in China, the ongoing corruption scandals, political uncertainty and contracting GDP in Brazil, and the heightened concerns of terrorist attacks. We include a factor in our loss ratios for the global risk, as we are increasingly aware of the threat that global concerns may affect our customers. While we are unable to determine with any precision the impact of global economic and political issues on our loan portfolios, we feel the risks are real and significant. We believe there is a risk of negative consequences for our borrowers that would affect their ability to repay their financial obligations. Therefore, we continue to include a factor for global risk in our analysis for the second quarter of 2016. Another area of concern continues to be our aircraft portfolio where we have a collateral concentration and $230 million in foreign exposure. The aircraft industry was among the sectors affected most by the sluggish economy. We have seen evidence that depressed private jet markets have stabilized. As the U.S. economy continues to improve, the industry is likely to benefit and we should see further strengthening of values. Nevertheless, we remain concerned about the prolonged low prices for several models. We also have some foreign exposure in this portfolio, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. Brazil is suffering from its worst recession in twenty-five years. We continue to monitor individual customer performance and assess risks in the portfolio as a whole. We do not see a clear trend of improvement or deterioration. We have assessed our reserve ratios, which were established based on the higher and more volatile loss histories and believe our reserve ratios remain appropriate. On June30, 2016 , 30 day and over loan and lease delinquencies were 0.28% compared to 0.30% on June30, 2015 . The decrease in delinquencies is largely attributable to the aircraft and consumer portfolios. The reserve for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding at the end of the period was 2.20% as compared to 2.25% one year ago. A summary of loan and lease loss experience during the three and six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015 is located in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. A loan or lease is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. We evaluate loans and leases exceeding $100,000 for impairment and establish a specific reserve as a component of the reserve for loan and lease losses when it is probable all amounts due will not be collected pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan or lease and the recorded investment in the loan or lease exceeds its fair value. A summary of impaired loans as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 is reflected in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 34 NONPERFORMING ASSETS The following table shows nonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and leases were 0.49% at June30, 2016 , 0.50% at December31, 2015 , and 0.55% at June30, 2015 . Nonperforming assets totaled $21.03 million at June30, 2016 , an increase of 1.98% from the $20.62 million reported at December31, 2015 , and a 3.17% decrease from the $21.72 million reported at June30, 2015 . The increase in nonperforming assets during the first six months of 2016 was related to an increase in repossessions and loans and leases past due 90 days or more offset by a decrease in nonaccrual loans and leases and sales of other real estate. The decrease in nonperforming assets at June30, 2016 from June30, 2015 occurred primarily in nonaccrual loans and leases and the sale of a former bank premises. The increase in loans past due 90 days or more at June30, 2016 from December31, 2015 occurred in the residential real estate and home equity and consumer portfolios. The decrease in nonaccrual loans and leases at June30, 2016 from December31, 2015 occurred primarily in the commercial and agricultural and residential real estate portfolios offset by increases in the commercial real estate and consumer portfolios. The decrease in nonaccrual loans and leases at June30, 2016 from June30, 2015 occurred primarily in the aircraft, residential real estate and commercial real estate portfolios offset by increases in the commercial and agricultural and consumer portfolios. A summary of nonaccrual loans and leases and past due aging for the period ended June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 is located in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other real estate is the result of foreclosing on real estate in the local market for which we have a current appraisal and are well secured. Other real estate increased slightly over the past year due to current foreclosures outpacing sales of existing properties. Repossessions consisted mainly of aircraft financing. At the time of repossession, the recorded amount of the loan or lease is written down to the fair value of the equipment or vehicle by a charge to the reserve for loan and lease losses or other income, if a positive adjustment, unless the equipment is in the process of immediate sale. Any subsequent fair value write-downs or write-ups, to the extent of previous write-downs, are included in noninterest expense. The following table shows a summary of other real estate and repossessions. For financial statement purposes, nonaccrual loans and leases are included in loan and lease outstandings, whereas repossessions and other real estate are included in other assets. Foreign Outstandings - Our foreign loan and lease outstandings, all denominated in U.S. dollars were $229.98 million and $205.83 million as of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 , respectively. Foreign loans and leases are in aircraft financing. Loan and lease outstandings to borrowers in Brazil and Mexico were $78.78 million and $136.45 million as of June30, 2016 , respectively, compared to $76.79 million and $116.73 million as of December31, 2015 , respectively. As of June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 there was not a significant concentration in any other country. 35 NONINTEREST INCOME The following table shows the details of noninterest income. NM = Not Meaningful Trust fees decreased slightly for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 over the same periods a year ago. Trust fees are largely based on the number and size of client relationships and the market value of assets under management. The market value of trust assets under management at June30, 2016 and December31, 2015 was $3.93 billion and $3.78 billion, respectively. Service charges on deposit accounts declined for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 over the comparable periods one year ago. The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts primarily reflects a lower volume of nonsufficient fund transactions and a decrease in paper statement fees as clients continue to move to online access for account statements. Debit card income increased in the three and six months ended June30, 2016 over the same periods a year ago. The improvement in debit card income was mainly the result of an increased volume of debit card transactions in 2016 . Mortgage banking income decreased in the three and six months ended June30, 2016 as compared to the same periods a year ago. The decrease in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 was caused by lower secondary market loan production and a decrease in servicing fees. The decrease for the first six months of 2016 compared with the same period a year ago was primarily caused by lower secondary market loan production. Insurance commissions declined during the three months ended June30, 2016 over the same period a year ago. The decrease in insurance commissions was primarily due to receiving contingency commissions during the second quarter in 2016 and the first quarter in 2015. Insurance commissions increased for the six months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to an increase in the book of business and higher contingency commissions received during 2016 . Equipment rental income grew for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 over the comparable periods one year ago. The increase was the result of the average equipment rental portfolio increasing 32.58% over the same period a year ago due to improving market conditions for equipment finance mainly in auto and light trucks, medium and heavy duty trucks and aircraft. The increase in equipment rental income was offset by a similar increase in depreciation on equipment owned under operating leases. Losses on investment securities available-for-sale during the three and six months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 were the result of an other than temporary impairment charge of $0.29 million on a marketable equity security offset by gains on the sale of U.S. States and political subdivisions securities. Other income increased for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 over the same periods a year ago. The increase during the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 was the result of gains on the liquidation of a partnership investment required by the Volcker Rule and higher mutual fund income offset by lower monogram fund income, a reduction in claim proceeds from bank owned life insurance and decreased customer swap fees. The higher income during the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago was mainly due to gains on the liquidation of a partnership investment required by the Volcker Rule and higher mutual fund income offset by lower monogram fund income and a reduction in claim proceeds from bank owned life insurance. 36 NONINTEREST EXPENSE The following table shows the details of noninterest expense. Salaries and employee benefits increased for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 . The increase for the second quarter 2016 was mainly due to higher base salary expense and increased group insurance costs offset by lower executive incentives. Higher base salary expense was primarily due to normal performance raises. Group insurance costs increased due to the timing of health insurance claims received in the second quarter 2016 versus the first quarter 2016. The increase for the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was mainly due to higher base salary expense offset by lower group insurance costs and a reduction in executive incentives. Higher base salary expense was primarily due to normal performance raises. Group insurance costs decreased as a result of overall lower health insurance claims experience. Net occupancy expense was flat during the three and six months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 . Furniture and equipment expense, including depreciation, increased during the three and six months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 . Furniture and equipment expense was higher in 2016 mainly due to increased computer processing charges, software, equipment maintenance costs and depreciation on new equipment with banking center remodels. During the second quarter and first six months of 2016 , depreciation on leased equipment increased in conjunction with the increase in equipment rental income as compared to the same period one year ago. Professional fees were slightly higher during the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. Professional fees grew during the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 mainly due to higher legal fees and increased utilization of consulting services offset by lower audit fees. Supplies and communication expense decreased slightly during the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago and increased slightly for the first six months of 2016 compared with the same period a year ago. FDIC and other insurance increased slightly during the three and six months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same periods a year ago. Business development and marketing expense decreased for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 versus the three and six months ended June30, 2015 . The lower expense in 2016 was primarily the result of decreased marketing promotions. Loan and lease collection and repossession expense increased for the three and six months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 . The increase during the second quarter of 2016 over the same period a year ago was primarily due to lower recoveries on repurchased mortgage loans, fewer gains on the sale of other real estate and increased valuation adjustments. Loan and lease collection and repossession expense increased for the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 mainly due to lower gains on the sale of other real estate owned and repossessions and lower recoveries on repurchased mortgage loans offset by decreased valuation adjustments. 37 Other expenses were lower during the three and six months ended June30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 . The decrease during the second quarter of 2016 over a year ago primarily related to fewer write-downs on fixed assets, lower employment and relocation expenses, reduced residential mortgage foreclosure expenses and debit card losses offset by an increase in provision on unfunded loan commitments and swap valuation adjustments. The decrease during the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 were mainly the result of lower expenses related to a previously reported proceeding that involved the Bank as trustee, fewer write-downs on fixed assets, reduced intangible asset amortization as items fully amortize and a decrease in employment and relocation expenses offset by an increase in provision on unfunded loan commitments and higher swap valuation adjustments. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes for the three and six month periods ended June30, 2016 was $8.03 million and $15.45 million respectively, compared to $8.51 million and $15.77 million for the same periods in 2015 . The effective tax rates were 35.67% and 35.26% for the second quarter ended June30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively and 35.31% and 35.12% for the six months ended June30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management's discussion and analysis is presented to provide information concerning 1st Source Corporation and its subsidiaries' (collectively referred to as "the Company", "we", and "our") financial condition as of September30, 2016 , as compared to December31, 2015 , and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 .

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. 29 FINANCIAL CONDITION Our total assets at September30, 2016 were $5.45 billion, an increase of $260.00 million or 5.01% from December31, 2015 . Total loans and leases were $4.18 billion, an increase of $184.73 million or 4.62% from December31, 2015 . Total investment securities, available-for-sale were $828.62 million which represented an increase of $36.89 million or 4.66% and equipment owned under operating leases was $117.88 million, an increase of $7.51 million or 6.81% from the comparable figures at December31, 2015 . Total deposits were $4.38 billion, an increase of $237.85 million or 5.75% from the end of 2015 . Short-term borrowings were $216.01 million, a decrease of $17.22 million or 7.38% from December31, 2015 . Nonperforming assets at September30, 2016 were $29.22 million, an increase of $8.60 million or 41.66% from the $20.62 million reported at December31, 2015 . At September30, 2016 and December31, 2015 , nonperforming assets were 0.68% and 0.50%, respectively of net loans and leases. The following table shows accrued income and other assets. CAPITAL As of September30, 2016 , total shareholders' equity was $670.26 million, up $26.21 million or 4.07% from the $644.05 million at December31, 2015 . In addition to net income of $42.56 million, other significant changes in shareholders' equity during the first nine months of 2016 included $8.03 million of common stock acquired for treasury and $14.03 million of dividends paid. The accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) component of shareholders' equity totaled $9.65 million at September30, 2016 , compared to $6.56 million at December31, 2015 . The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) during 2016 was the result of changes in unrealized gain/(loss) on securities in the available-for-sale portfolio. Our equity-to-assets ratio was 12.30% as of September30, 2016 , compared to 12.41% at December31, 2015 . Book value per common share rose to $25.91 at September30, 2016 , from $24.75 at December31, 2015 . We declared and paid cash dividends per common share of $0.18 during the third quarter of 2016 . The trailing four quarters dividend payout ratio, representing cash dividends per common share divided by diluted earnings per common share, was 32.93%. The dividend payout is continually reviewed by management and the Board of Directors subject to the Company's capital and dividend policy. The banking regulators have established guidelines for leverage capital requirements, expressed in terms of Tier 1 or core capital as a percentage of average assets, to measure the soundness of a financial institution. In addition, banking regulators have established risk-based capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. The final capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2015 introduced a requirement for a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule. Institutions that do not maintain this required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital buffer requirement is being phased in over three years beginning in 2016. We have included the 0.625% increase for 2016 in our minimum capital adequacy ratios in the table below. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5%, and the total capital ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis on January 1, 2019. Management believes that, as of September30, 2016 , 1st Source and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis as if all such requirements were currently in effect. 30 The actual capital amounts and ratios of 1st Source Corporation and 1st Source Bank as of September30, 2016 , are presented in the table below. LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY Effective liquidity management ensures that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as our operating cash needs are met. Funds are available from a number of sources, including the securities portfolio, the core deposit base, access to the national brokered certificates of deposit market, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings, Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) borrowings, and the capability to package loans for sale. We have borrowing sources available to supplement deposits and meet our funding needs. 1st Source Bank has established relationships with several banks to provide short term borrowings in the form of federal funds purchased. At September30, 2016 , we had no outstandings and could borrow approximately $265.00 million for a short time from these banks on a collective basis. As of September30, 2016 , we had $83.48 million outstanding in FHLB advances and could borrow an additional $149.84 million. We also had $492.24 million available to borrow from the FRB with no amounts outstanding as of September30, 2016 . Our loan to asset ratio was 76.72% at September30, 2016 compared to 77.00% at December31, 2015 and 77.47% at September30, 2015 . Cash and cash equivalents totaled $95.82 million at September30, 2016 compared to $79.72 million at December31, 2015 and $64.19 million at September30, 2015 . At September30, 2016 , the Statement of Financial Condition was rate sensitive by $640.35 million more assets than liabilities scheduled to reprice within one year, or approximately 1.30%. Management believes that the present funding sources provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash flow needs. Under Indiana law governing the collateralization of public fund deposits, the Indiana Board of Depositories determines which financial institutions are required to pledge collateral based on the strength of their financial ratings. We have been informed that no collateral is required for our public fund deposits. However, the Board of Depositories could alter this requirement in the future and adversely impact our liquidity. Our potential liquidity exposure if we must pledge collateral is approximately $578 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net income for the three and nine month periods ended September30, 2016 was $14.26 million and $42.56 million, compared to $13.93 million and $43.07 million for the same periods in 2015 . Diluted net income per common share was $0.55 and $1.63 for the three and nine month periods ended September30, 2016 , compared to $0.53 and $1.63 for the same periods in 2015 . Return on average common shareholders' equity was 8.62% for the nine months ended September30, 2016 , compared to 9.12% in 2015 . The return on total average assets was 1.07% for the nine months ended September30, 2016 , compared to 1.16% in 2015 . Net income decreased slightly for the nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 . Net interest income and noninterest income increased offset by an increase in provision for loan and lease losses, noninterest expense and income tax expense. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below. 31 NET INTEREST INCOME The following tables provide an analysis of net interest income and illustrates the interest income earned and interest expense charged for each major component of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Yields/rates are computed on a tax-equivalent basis, using a 35% rate. Nonaccrual loans and leases are included in the average loan and lease balance outstanding. DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL (1) See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" at the end of this section for additional information on this performance measure/ratio. Quarter Ended September30, 2016 compared to the Quarter Ended September30, 2015 The taxable equivalent net interest income for the three months ended September30, 2016 was $43.14 million, an increase of 1.22% over the same period in 2015 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.39% for the three months ended September30, 2016 , compared to 3.57% for the three months ended September30, 2015 . During the three month period ended September30, 2016 , average earning assets increased $333.04 million or 7.04% over the comparable period in 2015 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $244.82 million or 7.02%. The yield on average earning assets decreased 13 basis points to 3.83% from 3.96% primarily due to lower rates on loans and leases and investment securities available-for-sale. Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 8 basis points to 0.60% from 0.52%. The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was a decrease of 18 basis points. The largest contributors to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets for the three months ended September30, 2016 , compared to the three months ended September30, 2015 , was a reduction in yields on net loans and leases of 4 basis points and a reduction in yields on investment securities available-for-sale of 59 basis points due to market conditions. Average net loans and leases increased $278.36 million or 7.12%. Total average investment securities increased $39.10 million or 5.00%. Average mortgages held for sale increased $5.07 million or 52.77%. Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and commercial paper, increased $10.51 million or 34.16%. 32 Average interest-bearing deposits increased $286.35 million or 9.22% for the third quarter of 2016 over the same period in 2015 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits increased 8 basis points to 0.45% from 0.37%. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily the result of higher rates on certificates of deposit. Average short-term borrowings decreased $48.74 million or 18.31% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 5 basis points. Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $7.21 million or 12.55%. Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities decreased 49 basis points. The decrease was due to lower rates on mandatorily redeemable securities. DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL (1) See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" at the end of this section for additional information on this performance measure/ratio. Nine Months Ended September30, 2016 compared to the Nine Months Ended September30, 2015 The taxable equivalent net interest income for the nine months ended September30, 2016 was $127.65 million, an increase of 2.49% over the comparable period in 2015 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.43% for the nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to a net interest margin of 3.60% for the same period in 2015 . During the nine month period ended September30, 2016 , average earning assets increased $345.49 million or 7.47% over the comparable period in 2015 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $248.42 million or 7.23%. The yield on average earning assets decreased 10 basis points to 3.88% from 3.98%. The rate earned on assets decreased during 2016 over 2015 partially due to lower net interest recoveries of $1.46 million or 4 basis points largely related to one commercial loan relationship. Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 9 basis points to 0.61% from 0.52%. The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was a decrease of 17 basis points. 33 The largest contributor to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets for the nine months ended September30, 2016 , compared to the nine months ended September30, 2015 , was a reduction in yields on net loans and leases of 10 basis points due to the aforementioned net interest recoveries in 2015 which impacted the yield on net loans and leases by 6 basis points. Average net loans and leases increased $305.36 million or 8.04%. Total average investment securities increased $19.63 million or 2.49%. Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and commercial paper, increased $20.87 million or 65.55%. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $264.91 million or 8.61% for the first nine months of 2016 over the same period in 2015 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits increased 10 basis points to 0.46% compared to 0.36%. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily the result of higher rates on certificates of deposit and accelerated discount amortization on called brokered certificates of deposit during the first quarter of 2016 . Average short-term borrowings decreased $23.65 million or 9.79% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 5 basis points. The decrease in short-term borrowings was primarily the result of decreased borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB). Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $7.16 million or 12.53%. Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities decreased 2 basis points. The decrease was due to lower rates on long-term debt. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The accounting and reporting policies of 1st Source conform to generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company's performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components) and net interest margin (including its individual components). Management believes that these measures provide users of the Company's financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. PROVISION AND RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES The provision for loan and lease losses for the three and nine month periods ended September30, 2016 was $2.07 million and $5.09 million compared to a provision for loan and lease losses in the three and nine month periods ended September30, 2015 of $0.99 million and $2.16 million respectively. Net charge offs of $4.63 million were recorded for the third quarter 2016 , compared to net recoveries of $0.04 million for the same quarter a year ago. Year-to-date net charge offs of $4.31 million have been recorded in 2016 , compared to net recoveries of $0.39 million through September30, 2015 . 34 We believe geopolitical events have the potential to negatively impact the U.S. economy. Current concerns include the ongoing corruption scandals and political uncertainty in Latin American countries and the heightened concerns globally of terrorist attacks. We include a factor in our loss ratios for the global risk, as we are increasingly aware of the threat that global concerns may affect our customers. While we are unable to determine with any precision the impact of global economic and political issues on our loan portfolios, we feel the risks are real and significant. We believe there is a risk of negative consequences for our borrowers that would affect their ability to repay their financial obligations. Therefore, we continue to include a factor for global risk in our analysis for the third quarter of 2016. Another area of concern continues to be our aircraft portfolio where we have a collateral concentration and $243 million in foreign exposure. The aircraft industry was among the sectors affected most by the sluggish economy. Once again, we are noting softening collateral values, particularly for private jets. We remain concerned about the prolonged low prices for several models. We also have some foreign exposure in this portfolio, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. Brazil is suffering from its worst recession in twenty-five years. We continue to monitor individual customer performance and assess risks in the portfolio as a whole. We do not see a clear trend of improvement or deterioration. We have assessed our reserve ratios, which were established based on the higher and more volatile loss histories and believe our reserve ratios remain appropriate. On September30, 2016 , 30 day and over loan and lease delinquencies as a percentage of loan and lease outstandings were 0.23% compared to 0.46% on September30, 2015 . The decrease in delinquencies is largely attributable to the aircraft and consumer portfolios. The reserve for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding at the end of the period was 2.13% as compared to 2.22% one year ago. A summary of loan and lease loss experience during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 is located in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. A loan or lease is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. We evaluate loans and leases exceeding $100,000 for impairment and establish a specific reserve as a component of the reserve for loan and lease losses when it is probable all amounts due will not be collected pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan or lease and the recorded investment in the loan or lease exceeds its fair value. A summary of impaired loans as of September30, 2016 and December31, 2015 is reflected in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. NONPERFORMING ASSETS The following table shows nonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and leases were 0.68% at September30, 2016 , 0.50% at December31, 2015 , and 0.66% at September30, 2015 . Nonperforming assets totaled $29.22 million at September30, 2016 , an increase of 41.66% from the $20.62 million reported at December31, 2015 , and a 8.65% increase from the $26.89 million reported at September30, 2015 . The increase in nonperforming assets during the first nine months of 2016 was related to an increase in nonaccrual loans and leases, repossessions and loans and leases past due 90 days or more offset by a decrease in equipment owned under operating leases and sales of other real estate. The increase in nonperforming assets at September30, 2016 from September30, 2015 occurred primarily in nonaccrual loans and leases and repossessions. The increase in loans past due 90 days or more at September30, 2016 from December31, 2015 occurred in the residential real estate and home equity portfolio. The increase in nonaccrual loans and leases at September30, 2016 from December31, 2015 occurred primarily in the aircraft, commercial real estate, consumer, and construction equipment portfolios offset by decreases in the commercial and agricultural and residential real estate and home equity portfolios. The increase in nonaccrual loans and leases at September30, 2016 from September30, 2015 occurred primarily in the commercial real estate, aircraft, consumer, and construction equipment portfolios offset by decreases in the commercial and agricultural and residential real estate and home equity portfolios. A summary of nonaccrual loans and leases and past due aging for the period ended September30, 2016 and December31, 2015 is located in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other real estate is the result of foreclosing on real estate in the local market for which we have a current appraisal and are well secured. Other real estate increased slightly over the past year due to current foreclosures outpacing sales of existing properties. 35 Repossessions consisted mainly of aircraft financing. At the time of repossession, the recorded amount of the loan or lease is written down to the fair value of the equipment or vehicle by a charge to the reserve for loan and lease losses or other income, if a positive adjustment, unless the equipment is in the process of immediate sale. Any subsequent fair value write-downs or write-ups, to the extent of previous write-downs, are included in noninterest expense. The following table shows a summary of other real estate and repossessions. For financial statement purposes, nonaccrual loans and leases are included in loan and lease outstandings, whereas repossessions and other real estate are included in other assets. Foreign Outstandings - Our foreign loan and lease outstandings, all denominated in U.S. dollars were $242.88 million and $205.83 million as of September30, 2016 and December31, 2015 , respectively. Foreign loans and leases are in aircraft financing. Loan and lease outstandings to borrowers in Brazil and Mexico were $95.58 million and $135.64 million as of September30, 2016 , respectively, compared to $76.79 million and $116.73 million as of December31, 2015 , respectively. As of September30, 2016 and December31, 2015 there was not a significant concentration in any other country. NONINTEREST INCOME The following table shows the details of noninterest income. NM = Not Meaningful Trust fees were relatively flat during the three months ended September30, 2016 and during the first nine months of 2016 compared with the same periods a year ago. Trust fees are largely based on the number and size of client relationships and the market value of assets under management. The market value of trust assets under management at September30, 2016 and December31, 2015 was $4.08 billion and $3.78 billion, respectively. Service charges on deposit accounts declined for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 over the comparable periods in 2015. The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts primarily reflects a lower volume of nonsufficient fund transactions and a decrease in paper statement fees as clients continue to move to online access for account statements. Debit card income increased in the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 over the same periods a year ago. The improvement in debit card income was mainly the result of an increased volume of debit card transactions in 2016 . 36 Mortgage banking income increased in the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 as compared to the same periods a year ago. The increase in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 was caused by increased gains on loan sales and higher secondary market loan production offset by a decrease in servicing fees. The slight increase for the first nine months of 2016 compared with the same period a year ago was primarily caused by increased gains on loan sales offset by lower secondary market production and a reduction in loan servicing fees. Insurance commissions declined during the three months ended September30, 2016 over the same period a year ago. The decrease in insurance commissions was primarily due to a smaller book of business in the third quarter of 2016. Insurance commissions were flat for the nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Equipment rental income grew for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 over the comparable periods in 2015. The increase was the result of the average equipment rental portfolio increasing 29.32% over the same period a year ago due to improving market conditions for equipment finance mainly in auto and light trucks and construction equipment. The increase in equipment rental income was offset by a similar increase in depreciation on equipment owned under operating leases. Gains on investment securities available-for-sale during the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 resulted from the sale of marketable equity securities. Gains on investment securities available-for-sale during the first nine months of 2016 compared with the same period a year ago resulted from the sale of marketable equity securities and U.S. States and political subdivisions securities offset by an other than temporary impairment charge of $0.29 million on a marketable equity security. Other income decreased for the three months ended September30, 2016 over the same period a year ago as a result of lower monogram fund income and decreased customer swap fees. Other income increased during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. The increased income was mainly due to gains on the liquidation of a partnership investment required by the Volcker Rule and higher mutual fund income offset by lower monogram fund income, decreased customer swap fees and a reduction in claim proceeds from bank owned life insurance. NONINTEREST EXPENSE The following table shows the details of noninterest expense. Salaries and employee benefits increased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 . The increase in 2016 was mainly due to higher base salary expense offset by decreased group insurance costs. Higher base salary expense was primarily due to normal performance raises. Group insurance costs decreased as a result of overall lower health insurance claims experience. Net occupancy expense decreased slightly during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods a year ago. Furniture and equipment expense, including depreciation, increased during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 . Furniture and equipment expense was higher in 2016 mainly due to increased software maintenance costs and depreciation on new equipment with banking center remodels. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 , depreciation on leased equipment increased in conjunction with the increase in equipment rental income as compared to the same periods one year ago. 37 Professional fees were flat during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. Professional fees grew during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 mainly due to higher legal fees offset by lower audit fees. Supplies and communication expense decreased slightly during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago and increased slightly for the first nine months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. FDIC and other insurance decreased during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods a year ago. The decrease in 2016 was mainly due to lower assessments as a result of the Deposit Insurance Fund's reserve ratio exceeding the FDIC's established benchmark at the end of the second quarter. Business development and marketing expense increased slightly during the third quarter of 2016 and decreased for the nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods a year ago. The lower expense for 2016 was primarily the result of decreased marketing promotions. Loan and lease collection and repossession expense decreased during the third quarter of 2016 and increased for the nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 . The decrease during the third quarter of 2016 over the same period a year ago was primarily due to decreased valuation adjustments offset by lower recoveries on repurchased mortgage loans and higher collection and repossession expenses. Loan and lease collection and repossession expense increased for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 mainly due to fewer gains on the sale of other real estate owned and repossessions and lower recoveries on repurchased mortgage loans offset by decreased valuation adjustments. Other expenses were lower during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 . The decrease during the third quarter of 2016 over a year ago primarily related to reduced residential mortgage foreclosure expenses, a decrease in provision on unfunded loan commitments and fewer write-downs on fixed assets, offset by higher ATM losses. The decrease during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was mainly the result of reduced residential mortgage foreclosure expenses, writedowns of fixed assets and expenses related to a previously reported proceeding that involved the Bank as trustee in 2015 not present in 2016, a decrease in employment and relocation expenses, and reduced intangible asset amortization as items fully amortize offset by higher ATM losses, increased provision on unfunded loan commitments and reduced gains on the sale of operating lease equipment. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes for the three and nine month periods ended September30, 2016 was $7.88 million and $23.33 million respectively, compared to $7.35 million and $23.13 million for the same periods in 2015 . The effective tax rates were 35.59% and 34.55% for the third quarters ended September30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively and 35.41% and 34.94% for the nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management's discussion and analysis is presented to provide information concerning 1st Source Corporation and its subsidiaries' (collectively referred to as "the Company", "we", and "our") financial condition as of March31, 2017 , as compared to December31, 2016 , and the results of operations for the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 . This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the financial and statistical data appearing elsewhere in this report and our 2016 Annual Report. Except for historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this document express "forward-looking statements." Generally, the words "believe," "contemplate," "seek," "plan," "possible," "assume," "expect," "intend," "targeted," "continue," "remain," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "will," "should," "indicate," "would," "may" and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. 30 FINANCIAL CONDITION Our total assets at March31, 2017 were $5.50 billion, an increase of $15.26 million from December31, 2016 . Total loans and leases were $4.23 billion, an increase of $46.79 million, or 1.12% from December31, 2016 . Total investment securities, available-for-sale were $836.68 million which represented a decrease of $13.79 million, or 1.62% and equipment owned under operating leases was $127.32 million, an increase of $8.53 million, or 7.18% from the comparable figures at December31, 2016 . Total deposits were $4.34 billion, an increase of $3.22 million from the end of 2016 . Short-term borrowings were $279.75 million, a decrease of $12.20 million, or 4.18% from December31, 2016 . Long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities were $85.48 million, an increase of $11.17 million or 15.03% from December 31, 2016. Nonperforming assets at March31, 2017 were $27.50 million, a decrease of $2.94 million, or 9.65% from the $30.43 million reported at December31, 2016 . At March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 , nonperforming assets were 0.63% and 0.70%, respectively of net loans and leases. The following table shows accrued income and other assets. CAPITAL As of March31, 2017 , total shareholders' equity was $685.93 million, up $13.28 million, or 1.97% from the $672.65 million at December31, 2016 . In addition to net income of $16.21 million, other significant changes in shareholders' equity during the first three months of 2017 included $4.68 million of dividends paid. The accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) component of shareholders' equity totaled $1.33 million at March31, 2017 , compared to $1.34 million at December31, 2016 . Our equity-to-assets ratio was 12.47% as of March31, 2017 , compared to 12.26% at December31, 2016 . Book value per common share rose to $26.46 at March31, 2017 , from $26.00 at December31, 2016 . We declared and paid cash dividends per common share of $0.18 during the first quarter of 2017 . The trailing four quarters dividend payout ratio, representing cash dividends per common share divided by diluted earnings per common share, was 31.17%. The dividend payout is continually reviewed by management and the Board of Directors subject to the Company's capital and dividend policy. The banking regulators have established guidelines for leverage capital requirements, expressed in terms of Tier 1 or core capital as a percentage of average assets, to measure the soundness of a financial institution. In addition, banking regulators have established risk-based capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. 31 The actual capital amounts and ratios of 1st Source Corporation and 1st Source Bank as of March31, 2017 , are presented in the table below. (1) The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5%, and the total capital ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis. LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY Effective liquidity management ensures that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as our operating cash needs are met. Funds are available from a number of sources, including the securities portfolio, the core deposit base, access to the national brokered certificates of deposit market, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings, Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) borrowings, and the capability to package loans for sale. We have borrowing sources available to supplement deposits and meet our funding needs. 1st Source Bank has established relationships with several banks to provide short term borrowings in the form of federal funds purchased. At March31, 2017 , we had no outstandings and could borrow approximately $265.00 million for a short time from these banks on a collective basis. As of March31, 2017 , we had $157.90 million outstanding in FHLB advances and could borrow an additional $75.41 million. We also had $470.37 million available to borrow from the FRB with no amounts outstanding as of March31, 2017 . Our loan to asset ratio was 76.98% at March31, 2017 compared to 76.34% at December31, 2016 and 76.86% at March31, 2016 . Cash and cash equivalents totaled $92.12 million at March31, 2017 compared to $108.30 million at December31, 2016 and $85.23 million at March31, 2016 . At March31, 2017 , the Statement of Financial Condition was rate sensitive by $470.53 million more assets than liabilities scheduled to reprice within one year, or approximately 1.22%. Management believes that the present funding sources provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash flow needs. Under Indiana law governing the collateralization of public fund deposits, the Indiana Board of Depositories determines which financial institutions are required to pledge collateral based on the strength of their financial ratings. We have been informed that no collateral is required for our public fund deposits. However, the Board of Depositories could alter this requirement in the future and adversely impact our liquidity. Our potential liquidity exposure if we must pledge collateral is approximately $555 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net income for the three month period ended March31, 2017 was $16.21 million, compared to $13.82 million for the same period in 2016 . Diluted net income per common share was $0.62 for the three month period ended March31, 2017 , compared to $0.53 for the same period in 2016 . Return on average common shareholders' equity was 9.61% for the three months ended March31, 2017 , compared to 8.56% in 2016 . The return on total average assets was 1.21% for the three months ended March31, 2017 , compared to 1.07% in 2016 . Net income increased for the three months ended March31, 2017 compared to the first three months of 2016 . Net interest income and noninterest income increased offset by an increase in provision for loan and lease losses, noninterest expense and income tax expense. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below. 32 NET INTEREST INCOME The following tables provide an analysis of net interest income and illustrates the interest income earned and interest expense charged for each major component of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Yields/rates are computed on a tax-equivalent basis, using a 35% rate. Nonaccrual loans and leases are included in the average loan and lease balance outstanding. DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL (1) See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" at the end of this section for additional information on this performance measure/ratio. Quarter Ended March31, 2017 compared to the Quarter Ended March31, 2016 The taxable-equivalent net interest income for the three months ended March31, 2017 was $44.19 million, an increase of 5.84% over the same period in 2016 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 3.53% for the three months ended March31, 2017 , compared to 3.45% for the three months ended March31, 2016 . During the three month period ended March31, 2017 , average earning assets increased $211.64 million or 4.35% over the comparable period in 2016 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $140.74 million or 3.90%. The yield on average earning assets increased 7 basis points to 3.98% from 3.91% primarily due to higher rates on loans and leases and investment securities available-for-sale. Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities remained steady at 0.61%. The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was an increase of 8 basis points. The largest contributors to the improved yield on average earning assets for the three months ended March31, 2017 , compared to the three months ended March31, 2016 , was an increase in yields on net loans and leases of 6 basis points and growth in yields on investment securities available-for-sale of 11 basis points due to market conditions as a result of recent Federal interest rate increases. Average net loans and leases increased $178.80 million or 4.46%. Total average investment securities increased $44.43 million or 5.59%. Average mortgages held for sale decreased $0.98 million or 10.75%. Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and commercial paper, decreased $10.61 million or 20.66%. 33 Average interest-bearing deposits increased $91.41 million or 2.81% for the first quarter of 2017 over the same period in 2016 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits decreased 2 basis points to 0.45% from 0.47%. The decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily the result of accelerated discount amortization on called brokered certificates of deposit and a shift in the deposit mix in the first quarter of 2016. Average short-term borrowings increased $36.35 million or 15.70% for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 6 basis points due to recent Federal interest rate increases. Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $12.99 million or 20.78%. Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities was flat during the first quarter of 2017 from the same period in 2016. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The accounting and reporting policies of 1st Source conform to generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company's performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components) and net interest margin (including its individual components). Management believes that these measures provide users of the Company's financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. PROVISION AND RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES The provision for loan and lease losses for the three month period ended March31, 2017 was $1.00 million compared to a provision for loan and lease losses in the three month period ended March31, 2016 of $0.98 million. Net recoveries of $0.58 million were recorded for the first quarter 2017 , compared to net recoveries of $0.21 million for the same quarter a year ago. We believe geopolitical events have the potential to negatively impact the U.S. economy. Current concerns include the ongoing corruption scandals and political uncertainty in Latin American countries, the significant budget deficits in Brazil, the uncertain U.S. trade relationships with Mexico, and the heightened concerns globally of terrorist attacks. We include a factor in our loss ratios for the global risk, as we are increasingly aware of the threat that global concerns may affect our customers. While we are unable to determine with any precision the impact of global economic and political issues on our loan portfolios, we feel the risks are real and significant. We believe there is a risk of negative consequences for our borrowers that would affect their ability to repay their financial obligations. Therefore, we continue to include a factor for global risk in our analysis for the first quarter of 2017. 34 Another area of concern continues to be our aircraft portfolio where we have a collateral concentration and $229 million in foreign exposure. The aircraft industry was among the sectors affected most by the sluggish economy. Once again, we are noting softening collateral values, particularly for private jets. We remain concerned about the prolonged low prices for several models. We also have some foreign exposure in this portfolio, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. Brazil is suffering from its worst recession in twenty-five years. We continue to monitor individual customer performance and assess risks in the portfolio as a whole. We do not see a clear trend of improvement or deterioration. We have assessed our reserve ratios, which were established based on the higher and more volatile loss histories and believe our reserve ratios remain appropriate. On March31, 2017 , 30 day and over loan and lease delinquencies as a percentage of loan and lease outstandings were 0.17% compared to 0.28% on March31, 2016 . The decrease in delinquencies is largely attributable to the aircraft, construction equipment and residential real estate and home equity portfolios. The reserve for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding at the end of the period was 2.13% compared to 2.21% one year ago. A summary of loan and lease loss experience during the three months ended March31, 2017 and 2016 is located in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. A loan or lease is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. We evaluate loans and leases exceeding $100,000 for impairment and establish a specific reserve as a component of the reserve for loan and lease losses when it is probable all amounts due will not be collected pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan or lease and the recorded investment in the loan or lease exceeds its fair value. A summary of impaired loans as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 is reflected in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. NONPERFORMING ASSETS The following table shows nonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and leases were 0.63% at March31, 2017 , 0.70% at December31, 2016 , and 0.51% at March31, 2016 . Nonperforming assets totaled $27.50 million at March31, 2017 , a decrease of 9.65% from the $30.43 million reported at December31, 2016 , and a 28.77% increase from the $21.35 million reported at March31, 2016 . The decrease in nonperforming assets during the first three months of 2017 was mainly related to a reduction in nonaccrual loans and leases and repossessions offset by an increase in other real estate. The increase in nonperforming assets at March31, 2017 from March31, 2016 occurred primarily in nonaccrual loans and leases, other real estate and repossessions. The decrease in nonaccrual loans and leases at March31, 2017 from December31, 2016 occurred primarily in the commercial real estate and commercial and agricultural portfolios offset by increases in the aircraft portfolio. The increase in nonaccrual loans and leases at March31, 2017 from March31, 2016 occurred primarily in the aircraft, commercial real estate and construction equipment portfolios offset by a decrease in the commercial and agricultural portfolio. A summary of nonaccrual loans and leases and past due aging for the period ended March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 is located in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other real estate is the result of foreclosing on real estate in the local market for which we have a current appraisal and are well secured. Other real estate increased over the past year due to current foreclosures outpacing sales of existing properties. Repossessions consisted mainly of aircraft financing. At the time of repossession, the recorded amount of the loan or lease is written down to the fair value of the equipment or vehicle by a charge to the reserve for loan and lease losses or other income, if a positive adjustment, unless the equipment is in the process of immediate sale. Any subsequent fair value write-downs or write-ups, to the extent of previous write-downs, are included in noninterest expense. 35 The following table shows a summary of other real estate and repossessions. For financial statement purposes, nonaccrual loans and leases are included in loan and lease outstandings, whereas repossessions and other real estate are included in other assets. Foreign Outstandings - Our foreign loan and lease outstandings, all denominated in U.S. dollars were $228.67 million and $239.14 million as of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 , respectively. Foreign loans and leases are in aircraft financing. Loan and lease outstandings to borrowers in Brazil and Mexico were $91.37 million and $127.31 million as of March31, 2017 , respectively, compared to $96.31 million and $132.46 million as of December31, 2016 , respectively. As of March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 there was not a significant concentration in any other country. NONINTEREST INCOME The following table shows the details of noninterest income. NM = Not Meaningful Trust and wealth advisory fees (which include investment management fees, estate administration fees, mutual fund fees, annuity fees, and fiduciary fees) increased during the three months ended March31, 2017 compared with the same period a year ago. Trust and wealth advisory fees are largely based on the number and size of client relationships and the market value of assets under management. The market value of trust assets under management at March31, 2017 and December31, 2016 was $4.40 billion and $4.19 billion, respectively. Service charges on deposit accounts were higher for the three months ended March31, 2017 over the comparable period in 2016. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts primarily reflects a higher volume of nonsufficient fund transactions and an increase in fees for deposit accounts that went into effect during the first quarter of 2017 . Debit card income improved in the three months ended March31, 2017 over the same period a year ago. The improvement in debit card income was mainly the result of an increased volume of debit card transactions in 2017 . Mortgage banking income decreased in the three months ended March31, 2017 as compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 was caused by decreased gains on loan sales due to lower secondary market loan production offset by an increase in net servicing fees. 36 Insurance commissions were higher during the three months ended March31, 2017 over the same period a year ago. The increase in insurance commissions was primarily due to higher contingent commissions received during 2017. Equipment rental income grew for the three months ended March31, 2017 over the comparable period in 2016. The increase was the result of the average equipment rental portfolio growing 13.20% over the same period a year ago due to improving market conditions for equipment finance mainly in aircraft, auto and light trucks, medium and heavy duty trucks, and construction equipment. The growth in equipment rental income was offset by a similar increase in depreciation on equipment owned under operating leases. Gains on investment securities available-for-sale during the three months ended March31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 resulted from the sale of marketable equity securities. Other income decreased for the three months ended March31, 2017 over the same period a year ago as a result of gains on the partial liquidation of a partnership investment that occurred during the first quarter of 2016, lower monogram fund income and decreased customer swap fees offset by higher mutual fund income during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period a year ago. NONINTEREST EXPENSE The following table shows the details of noninterest expense. Salaries and employee benefits were flat for the three months ended March31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 mainly due to higher base salary expense offset by decreased group insurance costs. Higher base salary expense was primarily due to normal performance raises. Group insurance costs decreased as a result of overall lower health insurance claims experience. Net occupancy expense increased slightly during the three months ended March31, 2017 compared to the same period a year ago. Furniture and equipment expense, including depreciation, during the three months ended March31, 2017 was comparable to the same period in 2016 . During the first three months of 2017 , depreciation on leased equipment grew in conjunction with the growth in equipment rental income as compared to the same period one year ago. Professional fees declined during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease was mainly due to lower legal fees offset by increased utilization of consulting services. Supplies and communication expenses were lower during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period a year ago. The reduction resulted primarily from a decrease in postage offset by an increase in printing. FDIC and other insurance decreased during the three months ended March31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was mainly due to lower assessments as a result of the Deposit Insurance Fund's reserve ratio exceeding the FDIC's established benchmark. Business development and marketing expense increased during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period a year ago. The increased expense for 2017 was mainly the result of higher charitable contributions and marketing promotions. 37 Loan and lease collection and repossession expense were higher during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 . The increase was primarily due to higher general collection and repossession expenses and losses on the sale of repossessed assets offset by decreased valuation adjustments. Other expenses were lower during the three months ended March31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 . The decrease during the first quarter of 2017 over a year ago primarily related to reduced residential mortgage foreclosure expenses and swap valuation adjustments, a decrease in provision on unfunded loan commitments and fewer employment and relocation expenses offset by impairment writedowns on branches anticipated to be closed later in 2017. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes for the three month period ended March31, 2017 was $8.71 million, compared to $7.42 million for the same period in 2016 . The effective tax rate was 34.95% and 34.93% for the first quarter ended March31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management's discussion and analysis is presented to provide information concerning 1st Source Corporation and its subsidiaries' (collectively referred to as "the Company", "we", and "our") financial condition as of June30, 2017 , as compared to December31, 2016 , and the results of operations for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 .

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. 30 FINANCIAL CONDITION Our total assets at June30, 2017 were $5.69 billion, an increase of $200.96 million or 3.66% from December31, 2016 . Total loans and leases were $4.38 billion, an increase of $193.24 million, or 4.61% from December31, 2016 . Total investment securities, available-for-sale were $850.31 million which represented a slight decrease and equipment owned under operating leases was $144.51 million, an increase of $25.72 million, or 21.65% from the comparable figures at December31, 2016 . Total deposits were $4.48 billion, an increase of $148.28 million or 3.42% from the end of 2016 . Short-term borrowings were $306.58 million, an increase of $14.64 million, or 5.01% from December31, 2016 .

Nonperforming assets at June30, 2017 were $29.88 million, a decrease of $0.55 million, or 1.81% from the $30.43 million reported at December31, 2016 . At June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 , nonperforming assets were 0.66% and 0.70%, respectively of net loans and leases. The following table shows accrued income and other assets. CAPITAL As of June30, 2017 , total shareholders' equity was $699.20 million, up $26.55 million, or 3.95% from the $672.65 million at December31, 2016 . In addition to net income of $32.88 million, other significant changes in shareholders' equity during the first six months of 2017 included $9.62 million of dividends paid. The accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) component of shareholders' equity totaled $2.44 million at June30, 2017 , compared to $1.34 million at December31, 2016 . Our equity-to-assets ratio was 12.29% as of June30, 2017 , compared to 12.26% at December31, 2016 . Book value per common share rose to $26.96 at June30, 2017 , from $26.00 at December31, 2016 . We declared and paid cash dividends per common share of $0.19 during the second quarter of 2017 . The trailing four quarters dividend payout ratio, representing cash dividends per common share divided by diluted earnings per common share, was 30.54%. The dividend payout is continually reviewed by management and the Board of Directors subject to the Company's capital and dividend policy. The banking regulators have established guidelines for leverage capital requirements, expressed in terms of Tier 1 or core capital as a percentage of average assets, to measure the soundness of a financial institution. In addition, banking regulators have established risk-based capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. 31 The actual capital amounts and ratios of 1st Source Corporation and 1st Source Bank as of June30, 2017 , are presented in the table below. (1) The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5%, and the total capital ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis. LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY Effective liquidity management ensures that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as our operating cash needs are met. Funds are available from a number of sources, including the securities portfolio, the core deposit base, access to the national brokered certificates of deposit market, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings, Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) borrowings, and the capability to package loans for sale. We have borrowing sources available to supplement deposits and meet our funding needs. 1st Source Bank has established relationships with several banks to provide short term borrowings in the form of federal funds purchased. At June30, 2017 , we had no outstandings and could borrow approximately $265.00 million for a short time from these banks on a collective basis. As of June30, 2017 , we had $197.75 million outstanding in FHLB advances and could borrow an additional $75.10 million. We also had $505.25 million available to borrow from the FRB with no amounts outstanding as of June30, 2017 . Our loan to asset ratio was 77.04% at June30, 2017 compared to 76.34% at December31, 2016 and 77.19% at June30, 2016 . Cash and cash equivalents totaled $76.03 million at June30, 2017 compared to $108.30 million at December31, 2016 and $73.24 million at June30, 2016 . At June30, 2017 , the Statement of Financial Condition was rate sensitive by $470.55 million more assets than liabilities scheduled to reprice within one year, or approximately 1.21%. Management believes that the present funding sources provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash flow needs. Under Indiana law governing the collateralization of public fund deposits, the Indiana Board of Depositories determines which financial institutions are required to pledge collateral based on the strength of their financial ratings. We have been informed that no collateral is required for our public fund deposits. However, the Board of Depositories could alter this requirement in the future and adversely impact our liquidity. Our potential liquidity exposure if we must pledge collateral is approximately $647 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net income for the three and six month periods ended June30, 2017 was $16.67 million and $32.88 million, compared to $14.48 million and $28.30 million for the same periods in 2016 . Diluted net income per common share was $0.64 and $1.26 for the three and six month periods ended June30, 2017 , compared to $0.56 and $1.08 for the same periods in 2016 . Return on average common shareholders' equity was 9.60% for the six months ended June30, 2017 , compared to 8.70% in 2016 . The return on total average assets was 1.20% for the six months ended June30, 2017 , compared to 1.08% in 2016 . Net income increased for the six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the first six months of 2016 . Net interest income and noninterest income increased offset by an increase in provision for loan and lease losses, noninterest expense and income tax expense. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below. 32 NET INTEREST INCOME The following tables provide an analysis of net interest income and illustrates the interest income earned and interest expense charged for each major component of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Yields/rates are computed on a tax-equivalent basis, using a 35% rate. Nonaccrual loans and leases are included in the average loan and lease balance outstanding. DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL Quarter Ended June30, 2017 compared to the Quarter Ended June30, 2016 The taxable-equivalent net interest income for the three months ended June30, 2017 was $46.32 million, an increase of 8.34% over the same period in 2016 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 3.57% for the three months ended June30, 2017 , compared to 3.45% for the three months ended June30, 2016 . During the three month period ended June30, 2017 , average earning assets increased $218.87 million or 4.39% over the comparable period in 2016 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $173.21 million or 4.67%. The yield on average earning assets increased 17 basis points to 4.07% from 3.90% primarily due to higher rates on loans and leases and investment securities available-for-sale. Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 7 basis points to 0.68% from 0.61%. The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was an increase of 12 basis points. The largest contributors to the improved yield on average earning assets for the three months ended June30, 2017 , compared to the three months ended June30, 2016 , was an increase in yields on net loans and leases of 18 basis points and growth in yields on investment securities available-for-sale of 7 basis points due to market conditions as a result of recent Federal interest rate increases. Average net loans and leases increased $203.17 million or 4.95%. Total average investment securities increased $32.06 million or 3.98%. Average mortgages held for sale increased $0.23 million or 2.03%. Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock and commercial paper, decreased $16.58 million or 25.28%. 33 Average interest-bearing deposits increased $123.24 million or 3.65% for the second quarter of 2017 over the same period in 2016 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits grew 7 basis points to 0.52% from 0.45%. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily the result of higher rates and a slight shift in the deposit mix from the second quarter of 2016. Average short-term borrowings increased $31.89 million or 15.57% for the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 23 basis points due to recent Federal interest rate increases. Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $18.09 million or 27.44%. Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities decreased 81 basis points during the second quarter of 2017 from the same period in 2016 primarily due to lower rates on mandatorily redeemable securities. DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL 34 Six Months Ended June30, 2017 compared to the Six Months Ended June30, 2016 The taxable-equivalent net interest income for the six months ended June30, 2017 was $90.51 million, an increase of 7.11% over the comparable period in 2016 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 3.55% compared to a net interest margin of 3.45% for the same period in 2016 . During the six month period ended June30, 2017 , average earning assets increased $215.62 million or 4.38% over the comparable period in 2016 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $157.35 million or 4.30%. The yield on average earning assets increased 12 basis points to 4.03% from 3.91% primarily due to higher rates on loans and leases and investment securities available- for-sale. The total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 3 basis points to 0.64% from 0.61%. The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was an increase of 10 basis points. The largest contributor to the improved yield on average earning assets for the six months ended June30, 2017 , compared to the six months ended June30, 2016 , was an increase in yields on net loans and leases of 12 basis points primarily due to market conditions as a result of recent Federal interest rate increases. Average net loans and leases increased $191.32 million or 4.72%. Total average investment securities increased $38.24 million or 4.78%. Average mortgages held for sale decreased $0.37 million or 3.67%. Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock and commercial paper, declined $13.57 million or 23.21%. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $107.76 million or 3.25% for the first six months of 2017 over the same period in 2016 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits grew 3 basis points to 0.49% compared to 0.46%. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily the result of higher rates and a slight shift in the deposit mix. Average short-term borrowings increased $34.03 million or 15.60% for the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 14 basis points. The growth in short-term borrowings was primarily the result of higher borrowings with the FHLB. Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $15.56 million or 24.24%. Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities decreased 41 basis points due to lower rates on long-term debt. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The accounting and reporting policies of 1st Source conform to generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company's performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components) and net interest margin (including its individual components). Management believes that these measures provide users of the Company's financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. 35 PROVISION AND RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES The provision for loan and lease losses for the three and six month periods ended June30, 2017 was $2.74 million and $3.74 million compared to a provision for loan and lease losses in the three and six month periods ended June30, 2016 of $2.05 million and $3.02 million, respectively. Net charge-offs of $0.94 million were recorded for the second quarter 2017 , compared to net recoveries of $0.11 million for the same quarter a year ago. Year-to-date net charge-offs of $0.37 million have been recorded in 2017 , compared to net recoveries of $0.32 million through June30, 2016 . We believe geopolitical events have the potential to negatively impact the U.S. economy. Current concerns include the ongoing corruption scandals and political uncertainty in Latin American countries, the significant budget deficits in Brazil, the uncertain U.S. trade relationships with Mexico, and the heightened concerns globally of terrorist attacks. We include a factor in our loss ratios for the global risk, as we are increasingly aware of the threat that global concerns may affect our customers. While we are unable to determine with any precision the impact of global economic and political issues on our loan portfolios, we feel the risks are real and significant. We believe there is a risk of negative consequences for our borrowers that would affect their ability to repay their financial obligations. Therefore, we continue to include a factor for global risk in our analysis for the second quarter of 2017. Another area of concern continues to be our aircraft portfolio where we have a collateral concentration and $227 million in foreign exposure. The aircraft industry was among the sectors affected most by the sluggish economy. Values for some aircraft have not fully recovered. Once again, we are noting softening collateral values, particularly for private jets. We remain concerned about the prolonged low prices for several models. We also have some foreign exposure in this portfolio, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. Brazil is beginning to show some positive economic signs as it emerges from its worst recession in twenty-five years. However, the country continues to be plagued by corruption scandals. We continue to monitor individual customer performance and assess risks in the portfolio as a whole. We have assessed our reserve ratios, which were established based on the higher and more volatile loss histories and believe our reserve ratios remain appropriate. On June30, 2017 , 30 day and over loan and lease delinquencies as a percentage of loan and lease outstandings were 0.16% compared to 0.28% on June30, 2016 . The decrease in delinquencies is largely attributable to the aircraft and construction equipment portfolios. The reserve for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding at the end of the period was 2.10% compared to 2.20% one year ago. A summary of loan and lease loss experience during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 is located in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. A loan or lease is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. We evaluate loans and leases exceeding $100,000 for impairment and establish a specific reserve as a component of the reserve for loan and lease losses when it is probable all amounts due will not be collected pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan or lease and the recorded investment in the loan or lease exceeds its fair value. A summary of impaired loans as of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 is reflected in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. NONPERFORMING ASSETS The following table shows nonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and leases were 0.66% at June30, 2017 , 0.70% at December31, 2016 , and 0.49% at June30, 2016 . Nonperforming assets totaled $29.88 million at June30, 2017 , a decrease of 1.81% from the $30.43 million reported at December31, 2016 , and a 42.09% increase from the $21.03 million reported at June30, 2016 . The decrease in nonperforming assets during the first six months of 2017 was mainly related to a reduction in nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases past due 90 days or more offset by an increase in repossessions. The increase in nonperforming assets at June30, 2017 from June30, 2016 occurred primarily in nonaccrual loans and leases, other real estate and repossessions. 36 The decrease in nonaccrual loans and leases at June30, 2017 from December31, 2016 occurred primarily in the aircraft and commercial real estate portfolios offset by an increase in the commercial and agricultural portfolio. The increase in nonaccrual loans and leases at June30, 2017 from June30, 2016 occurred primarily in the commercial and agricultural, commercial real estate and residential real estate and home equity portfolios offset by a decrease in the aircraft portfolio. A summary of nonaccrual loans and leases and past due aging for the period ended June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 is located in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other real estate is the result of foreclosing on real estate in the local market for which we have a current appraisal and are well secured. Other real estate increased over the past year due to current foreclosures outpacing sales of existing properties. Repossessions consisted mainly of aircraft financing. At the time of repossession, the recorded amount of the loan or lease is written down to the fair value of the equipment or vehicle by a charge to the reserve for loan and lease losses or other income, if a positive adjustment, unless the equipment is in the process of immediate sale. Any subsequent fair value write-downs or write-ups, to the extent of previous write-downs, are included in noninterest expense. The following table shows a summary of other real estate and repossessions. For financial statement purposes, nonaccrual loans and leases are included in loan and lease outstandings, whereas repossessions and other real estate are included in other assets. Foreign Outstandings - Our foreign loan and lease outstandings, all denominated in U.S. dollars were $226.55 million and $239.14 million as of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 , respectively. Foreign loans and leases are in aircraft financing. Loan and lease outstandings to borrowers in Brazil and Mexico were $98.35 million and $115.39 million as of June30, 2017 , respectively, compared to $96.31 million and $132.46 million as of December31, 2016 , respectively. As of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 there was not a significant concentration in any other country. NONINTEREST INCOME The following table shows the details of noninterest income. NM = Not Meaningful 37 Trust and wealth advisory fees (which include investment management fees, estate administration fees, mutual fund fees, annuity fees, and fiduciary fees) increased during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared with the same periods a year ago. Trust and wealth advisory fees are largely based on the number and size of client relationships and the market value of assets under management. The market value of trust assets under management at June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 was $4.49 billion and $4.19 billion, respectively. Service charges on deposit accounts were higher for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 over the comparable periods in 2016. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts primarily reflects a higher volume of nonsufficient fund transactions and an increase in fees for deposit accounts that went into effect during the first quarter of 2017 . Debit card income improved in the three and six months ended June30, 2017 over the same periods a year ago. The improvement in debit card income was mainly the result of an increased volume of debit card transactions in 2017 . Mortgage banking income increased in the three and six months ended June30, 2017 as compared to the same periods a year ago. The increase was caused by lower MSR amortization expense and higher mortgage fees offset by a decrease in net servicing fees and year-to-date decreased gains on loan sales due to reduced profit margins. Insurance commissions were higher during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 over the same periods a year ago. The increase in insurance commissions during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to an increased book of business. The increase in insurance commissions for the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period a year ago was mainly due to an increase in the book of business and higher contingent commissions received during 2017 resulting from increased sales and lower client claims. Equipment rental income grew for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 over the comparable periods in 2016. The increase was the result of the average equipment rental portfolio growing 16.17% over the same period a year ago due to improving market conditions for equipment finance mainly in construction equipment and auto and light trucks. The growth in equipment rental income was offset by a similar increase in depreciation on equipment owned under operating leases. Gains (losses) on investment securities available-for-sale during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 resulted from the sale of marketable equity securities. These gains were offset by an OTTI loss of $0.19 million on a marketable equity security during the second quarter of 2017 compared with an OTTI loss of $0.29 million in 2016. Other income decreased for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 over the same periods a year ago primarily as a result of gains on the liquidation of a partnership investment that occurred during 2016. Other items contributing to the decrease included lower monogram fund income, decreased customer swap fees and reduced mutual fund income. NONINTEREST EXPENSE The following table shows the details of noninterest expense. Salaries and employee benefits decreased during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 mainly due to lower group insurance costs offset by higher base salary expense. Group insurance costs decreased as a result of overall lower health insurance claims experience.Higher base salary expense was primarily due to normal performance raises. Net occupancy expense increased slightly during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago. 38 Furniture and equipment expense, including depreciation, increased during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . Furniture and equipment expense was higher in 2017 mainly due to increased software maintenance expense. During the second quarter and first six months of 2017 , depreciation on leased equipment grew in conjunction with the growth in equipment rental income as compared to the same periods one year ago. Professional fees increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago. The increase was mainly due to increased utilization of consulting services offset by lower legal fees. Supplies and communication expense was flat during the second quarter of 2017 and decreased during the first six months of 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago. The reduction resulted primarily from a decrease in postage offset by an increase in printing. FDIC and other insurance decreased during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was mainly due to lower assessments as a result of the Deposit Insurance Fund's reserve ratio exceeding the FDIC's established benchmark. Business development and marketing expense increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago. The higher expense during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same period a year ago was primarily due to increased marketing promotions. The increased expense for the first six months of 2017 compared to 2016 was mainly the result of higher charitable contributions and marketing promotions. Loan and lease collection and repossession expense decreased during the second quarter of 2017 and increased for the first six months of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . The reduction during the second quarter of 2017 over the same period a year ago was mainly due to decreased valuation adjustments offset by lower recoveries on repurchased mortgage loans. Loan and lease collection and expense increased for the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to higher general collection and repossession expenses and losses on the sale of repossessed assets offset by decreased valuation adjustments. Other expenses were lower during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . The decrease during the second quarter of 2017 over a year ago primarily related to gains on the sale of leased equipment and a decrease in the provision on unfunded loan commitments offset by increased training expenses. The decrease during the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was mainly the result of gains on the sale of leased equipment, reduced residential mortgage foreclosure expenses and swap valuation adjustments, a decrease in provision on unfunded loan commitments offset by impairment writedowns on branches to be closed in the third quarter of 2017. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes for the three and six month periods ended June30, 2017 was $9.49 million and $18.19 million, compared to $8.03 million and $15.45 million for the same periods in 2016 . The effective tax rate was 36.27% and 35.67% for the second quarter ended June30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively and 35.63% and 35.31% for the six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
