ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management's discussion and analysis is presented to provide information concerning 1st Source Corporation and its subsidiaries' (collectively referred to as "the Company", "we", and "our") financial condition as of June30, 2017 , as compared to December31, 2016 , and the results of operations for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 . This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the financial and statistical data appearing elsewhere in this report and our 2016 Annual Report. Except for historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this document express "forward-looking statements." Generally, the words "believe," "contemplate," "seek," "plan," "possible," "assume," "expect," "intend," "targeted," "continue," "remain," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "will," "should," "indicate," "would," "may" and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.

Such factors include, but are not limited to, changes in law, regulations or GAAP; our competitive position within the markets we serve; increasing consolidation within the banking industry; unforeseen changes in interest rates; unforeseen changes in loan prepayment assumptions; unforeseen downturns in or major events affecting the local, regional or national economies or the industries in which we have credit concentrations; and other matters discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form10-K for 2016 , which filings are available from the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. 30 FINANCIAL CONDITION Our total assets at June30, 2017 were $5.69 billion, an increase of $200.96 million or 3.66% from December31, 2016 . Total loans and leases were $4.38 billion, an increase of $193.24 million, or 4.61% from December31, 2016 . Total investment securities, available-for-sale were $850.31 million which represented a slight decrease and equipment owned under operating leases was $144.51 million, an increase of $25.72 million, or 21.65% from the comparable figures at December31, 2016 . Total deposits were $4.48 billion, an increase of $148.28 million or 3.42% from the end of 2016 . Short-term borrowings were $306.58 million, an increase of $14.64 million, or 5.01% from December31, 2016 . Long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities were $70.44 million, a decrease of $3.87 million or 5.21% from December 31, 2016. Nonperforming assets at June30, 2017 were $29.88 million, a decrease of $0.55 million, or 1.81% from the $30.43 million reported at December31, 2016 . At June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 , nonperforming assets were 0.66% and 0.70%, respectively of net loans and leases. The following table shows accrued income and other assets.  CAPITAL As of June30, 2017 , total shareholders' equity was $699.20 million, up $26.55 million, or 3.95% from the $672.65 million at December31, 2016 . In addition to net income of $32.88 million, other significant changes in shareholders' equity during the first six months of 2017 included $9.62 million of dividends paid. The accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) component of shareholders' equity totaled $2.44 million at June30, 2017 , compared to $1.34 million at December31, 2016 . Our equity-to-assets ratio was 12.29% as of June30, 2017 , compared to 12.26% at December31, 2016 . Book value per common share rose to $26.96 at June30, 2017 , from $26.00 at December31, 2016 . We declared and paid cash dividends per common share of $0.19 during the second quarter of 2017 . The trailing four quarters dividend payout ratio, representing cash dividends per common share divided by diluted earnings per common share, was 30.54%. The dividend payout is continually reviewed by management and the Board of Directors subject to the Company's capital and dividend policy. The banking regulators have established guidelines for leverage capital requirements, expressed in terms of Tier 1 or core capital as a percentage of average assets, to measure the soundness of a financial institution. In addition, banking regulators have established risk-based capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. 31 The actual capital amounts and ratios of 1st Source Corporation and 1st Source Bank as of June30, 2017 , are presented in the table below.  (1) The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5%, and the total capital ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis. LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY Effective liquidity management ensures that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as our operating cash needs are met. Funds are available from a number of sources, including the securities portfolio, the core deposit base, access to the national brokered certificates of deposit market, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings, Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) borrowings, and the capability to package loans for sale. We have borrowing sources available to supplement deposits and meet our funding needs. 1st Source Bank has established relationships with several banks to provide short term borrowings in the form of federal funds purchased. At June30, 2017 , we had no outstandings and could borrow approximately $265.00 million for a short time from these banks on a collective basis. As of June30, 2017 , we had $197.75 million outstanding in FHLB advances and could borrow an additional $75.10 million. We also had $505.25 million available to borrow from the FRB with no amounts outstanding as of June30, 2017 . Our loan to asset ratio was 77.04% at June30, 2017 compared to 76.34% at December31, 2016 and 77.19% at June30, 2016 . Cash and cash equivalents totaled $76.03 million at June30, 2017 compared to $108.30 million at December31, 2016 and $73.24 million at June30, 2016 . At June30, 2017 , the Statement of Financial Condition was rate sensitive by $470.55 million more assets than liabilities scheduled to reprice within one year, or approximately 1.21%. Management believes that the present funding sources provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash flow needs. Under Indiana law governing the collateralization of public fund deposits, the Indiana Board of Depositories determines which financial institutions are required to pledge collateral based on the strength of their financial ratings. We have been informed that no collateral is required for our public fund deposits. However, the Board of Depositories could alter this requirement in the future and adversely impact our liquidity. Our potential liquidity exposure if we must pledge collateral is approximately $647 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net income for the three and six month periods ended June30, 2017 was $16.67 million and $32.88 million, compared to $14.48 million and $28.30 million for the same periods in 2016 . Diluted net income per common share was $0.64 and $1.26 for the three and six month periods ended June30, 2017 , compared to $0.56 and $1.08 for the same periods in 2016 . Return on average common shareholders' equity was 9.60% for the six months ended June30, 2017 , compared to 8.70% in 2016 . The return on total average assets was 1.20% for the six months ended June30, 2017 , compared to 1.08% in 2016 . Net income increased for the six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the first six months of 2016 . Net interest income and noninterest income increased offset by an increase in provision for loan and lease losses, noninterest expense and income tax expense. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below. 32 NET INTEREST INCOME The following tables provide an analysis of net interest income and illustrates the interest income earned and interest expense charged for each major component of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Yields/rates are computed on a tax-equivalent basis, using a 35% rate. Nonaccrual loans and leases are included in the average loan and lease balance outstanding. DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL Quarter Ended June30, 2017 compared to the Quarter Ended June30, 2016  The taxable-equivalent net interest income for the three months ended June30, 2017 was $46.32 million, an increase of 8.34% over the same period in 2016 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 3.57% for the three months ended June30, 2017 , compared to 3.45% for the three months ended June30, 2016 . During the three month period ended June30, 2017 , average earning assets increased $218.87 million or 4.39% over the comparable period in 2016 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $173.21 million or 4.67%. The yield on average earning assets increased 17 basis points to 4.07% from 3.90% primarily due to higher rates on loans and leases and investment securities available-for-sale. Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 7 basis points to 0.68% from 0.61%. The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was an increase of 12 basis points. The largest contributors to the improved yield on average earning assets for the three months ended June30, 2017 , compared to the three months ended June30, 2016 , was an increase in yields on net loans and leases of 18 basis points and growth in yields on investment securities available-for-sale of 7 basis points due to market conditions as a result of recent Federal interest rate increases. Average net loans and leases increased $203.17 million or 4.95%. Total average investment securities increased $32.06 million or 3.98%. Average mortgages held for sale increased $0.23 million or 2.03%. Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock and commercial paper, decreased $16.58 million or 25.28%. 33 Average interest-bearing deposits increased $123.24 million or 3.65% for the second quarter of 2017 over the same period in 2016 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits grew 7 basis points to 0.52% from 0.45%. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily the result of higher rates and a slight shift in the deposit mix from the second quarter of 2016. Average short-term borrowings increased $31.89 million or 15.57% for the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 23 basis points due to recent Federal interest rate increases. Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $18.09 million or 27.44%. Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities decreased 81 basis points during the second quarter of 2017 from the same period in 2016 primarily due to lower rates on mandatorily redeemable securities. DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL 34 Six Months Ended  June30, 2017 compared to the Six Months Ended  June30, 2016  The taxable-equivalent net interest income for the six months ended June30, 2017 was $90.51 million, an increase of 7.11% over the comparable period in 2016 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 3.55% compared to a net interest margin of 3.45% for the same period in 2016 . During the six month period ended June30, 2017 , average earning assets increased $215.62 million or 4.38% over the comparable period in 2016 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $157.35 million or 4.30%. The yield on average earning assets increased 12 basis points to 4.03% from 3.91% primarily due to higher rates on loans and leases and investment securities available- for-sale. The total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 3 basis points to 0.64% from 0.61%. The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was an increase of 10 basis points. The largest contributor to the improved yield on average earning assets for the six months ended June30, 2017 , compared to the six months ended June30, 2016 , was an increase in yields on net loans and leases of 12 basis points primarily due to market conditions as a result of recent Federal interest rate increases. Average net loans and leases increased $191.32 million or 4.72%. Total average investment securities increased $38.24 million or 4.78%. Average mortgages held for sale decreased $0.37 million or 3.67%. Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock and commercial paper, declined $13.57 million or 23.21%. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $107.76 million or 3.25% for the first six months of 2017 over the same period in 2016 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits grew 3 basis points to 0.49% compared to 0.46%. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily the result of higher rates and a slight shift in the deposit mix. Average short-term borrowings increased $34.03 million or 15.60% for the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 14 basis points. The growth in short-term borrowings was primarily the result of higher borrowings with the FHLB. Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $15.56 million or 24.24%. Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities decreased 41 basis points due to lower rates on long-term debt. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The accounting and reporting policies of 1st Source conform to generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company's performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components) and net interest margin (including its individual components). Management believes that these measures provide users of the Company's financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. 35 PROVISION AND RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES  The provision for loan and lease losses for the three and six month periods ended June30, 2017 was $2.74 million and $3.74 million compared to a provision for loan and lease losses in the three and six month periods ended June30, 2016 of $2.05 million and $3.02 million, respectively. Net charge-offs of $0.94 million were recorded for the second quarter 2017 , compared to net recoveries of $0.11 million for the same quarter a year ago. Year-to-date net charge-offs of $0.37 million have been recorded in 2017 , compared to net recoveries of $0.32 million through June30, 2016 . We believe geopolitical events have the potential to negatively impact the U.S. economy. Current concerns include the ongoing corruption scandals and political uncertainty in Latin American countries, the significant budget deficits in Brazil, the uncertain U.S. trade relationships with Mexico, and the heightened concerns globally of terrorist attacks. We include a factor in our loss ratios for the global risk, as we are increasingly aware of the threat that global concerns may affect our customers. While we are unable to determine with any precision the impact of global economic and political issues on our loan portfolios, we feel the risks are real and significant. We believe there is a risk of negative consequences for our borrowers that would affect their ability to repay their financial obligations. Therefore, we continue to include a factor for global risk in our analysis for the second quarter of 2017. Another area of concern continues to be our aircraft portfolio where we have a collateral concentration and $227 million in foreign exposure. The aircraft industry was among the sectors affected most by the sluggish economy. Values for some aircraft have not fully recovered. Once again, we are noting softening collateral values, particularly for private jets. We remain concerned about the prolonged low prices for several models. We also have some foreign exposure in this portfolio, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. Brazil is beginning to show some positive economic signs as it emerges from its worst recession in twenty-five years. However, the country continues to be plagued by corruption scandals. We continue to monitor individual customer performance and assess risks in the portfolio as a whole. We have assessed our reserve ratios, which were established based on the higher and more volatile loss histories and believe our reserve ratios remain appropriate. On June30, 2017 , 30 day and over loan and lease delinquencies as a percentage of loan and lease outstandings were 0.16% compared to 0.28% on June30, 2016 . The decrease in delinquencies is largely attributable to the aircraft and construction equipment portfolios. The reserve for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding at the end of the period was 2.10% compared to 2.20% one year ago. A summary of loan and lease loss experience during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 is located in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. A loan or lease is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. We evaluate loans and leases exceeding $100,000 for impairment and establish a specific reserve as a component of the reserve for loan and lease losses when it is probable all amounts due will not be collected pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan or lease and the recorded investment in the loan or lease exceeds its fair value. A summary of impaired loans as of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 is reflected in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. NONPERFORMING ASSETS  The following table shows nonperforming assets.  Nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and leases were 0.66% at June30, 2017 , 0.70% at December31, 2016 , and 0.49% at June30, 2016 . Nonperforming assets totaled $29.88 million at June30, 2017 , a decrease of 1.81% from the $30.43 million reported at December31, 2016 , and a 42.09% increase from the $21.03 million reported at June30, 2016 . The decrease in nonperforming assets during the first six months of 2017 was mainly related to a reduction in nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases past due 90 days or more offset by an increase in repossessions. The increase in nonperforming assets at June30, 2017 from June30, 2016 occurred primarily in nonaccrual loans and leases, other real estate and repossessions. 36 The decrease in nonaccrual loans and leases at June30, 2017 from December31, 2016 occurred primarily in the aircraft and commercial real estate portfolios offset by an increase in the commercial and agricultural portfolio. The increase in nonaccrual loans and leases at June30, 2017 from June30, 2016 occurred primarily in the commercial and agricultural, commercial real estate and residential real estate and home equity portfolios offset by a decrease in the aircraft portfolio. A summary of nonaccrual loans and leases and past due aging for the period ended June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 is located in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other real estate is the result of foreclosing on real estate in the local market for which we have a current appraisal and are well secured. Other real estate increased over the past year due to current foreclosures outpacing sales of existing properties. Repossessions consisted mainly of aircraft financing. At the time of repossession, the recorded amount of the loan or lease is written down to the fair value of the equipment or vehicle by a charge to the reserve for loan and lease losses or other income, if a positive adjustment, unless the equipment is in the process of immediate sale. Any subsequent fair value write-downs or write-ups, to the extent of previous write-downs, are included in noninterest expense. The following table shows a summary of other real estate and repossessions.  For financial statement purposes, nonaccrual loans and leases are included in loan and lease outstandings, whereas repossessions and other real estate are included in other assets. Foreign Outstandings - Our foreign loan and lease outstandings, all denominated in U.S. dollars were $226.55 million and $239.14 million as of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 , respectively. Foreign loans and leases are in aircraft financing. Loan and lease outstandings to borrowers in Brazil and Mexico were $98.35 million and $115.39 million as of June30, 2017 , respectively, compared to $96.31 million and $132.46 million as of December31, 2016 , respectively. As of June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 there was not a significant concentration in any other country. NONINTEREST INCOME The following table shows the details of noninterest income. NM = Not Meaningful 37 Trust and wealth advisory fees (which include investment management fees, estate administration fees, mutual fund fees, annuity fees, and fiduciary fees) increased during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared with the same periods a year ago. Trust and wealth advisory fees are largely based on the number and size of client relationships and the market value of assets under management. The market value of trust assets under management at June30, 2017 and December31, 2016 was $4.49 billion and $4.19 billion, respectively. Service charges on deposit accounts were higher for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 over the comparable periods in 2016. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts primarily reflects a higher volume of nonsufficient fund transactions and an increase in fees for deposit accounts that went into effect during the first quarter of 2017 . Debit card income improved in the three and six months ended June30, 2017 over the same periods a year ago. The improvement in debit card income was mainly the result of an increased volume of debit card transactions in 2017 . Mortgage banking income increased in the three and six months ended June30, 2017 as compared to the same periods a year ago. The increase was caused by lower MSR amortization expense and higher mortgage fees offset by a decrease in net servicing fees and year-to-date decreased gains on loan sales due to reduced profit margins. Insurance commissions were higher during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 over the same periods a year ago. The increase in insurance commissions during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to an increased book of business. The increase in insurance commissions for the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period a year ago was mainly due to an increase in the book of business and higher contingent commissions received during 2017 resulting from increased sales and lower client claims. Equipment rental income grew for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 over the comparable periods in 2016. The increase was the result of the average equipment rental portfolio growing 16.17% over the same period a year ago due to improving market conditions for equipment finance mainly in construction equipment and auto and light trucks. The growth in equipment rental income was offset by a similar increase in depreciation on equipment owned under operating leases. Gains (losses) on investment securities available-for-sale during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 resulted from the sale of marketable equity securities. These gains were offset by an OTTI loss of $0.19 million on a marketable equity security during the second quarter of 2017 compared with an OTTI loss of $0.29 million in 2016. Other income decreased for the three and six months ended June30, 2017 over the same periods a year ago primarily as a result of gains on the liquidation of a partnership investment that occurred during 2016. Other items contributing to the decrease included lower monogram fund income, decreased customer swap fees and reduced mutual fund income. NONINTEREST EXPENSE The following table shows the details of noninterest expense. Salaries and employee benefits decreased during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 mainly due to lower group insurance costs offset by higher base salary expense. Group insurance costs decreased as a result of overall lower health insurance claims experience.Higher base salary expense was primarily due to normal performance raises. Net occupancy expense increased slightly during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago. 38 Furniture and equipment expense, including depreciation, increased during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . Furniture and equipment expense was higher in 2017 mainly due to increased software maintenance expense. During the second quarter and first six months of 2017 , depreciation on leased equipment grew in conjunction with the growth in equipment rental income as compared to the same periods one year ago. Professional fees increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago. The increase was mainly due to increased utilization of consulting services offset by lower legal fees. Supplies and communication expense was flat during the second quarter of 2017 and decreased during the first six months of 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago. The reduction resulted primarily from a decrease in postage offset by an increase in printing. FDIC and other insurance decreased during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was mainly due to lower assessments as a result of the Deposit Insurance Fund's reserve ratio exceeding the FDIC's established benchmark. Business development and marketing expense increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago. The higher expense during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same period a year ago was primarily due to increased marketing promotions. The increased expense for the first six months of 2017 compared to 2016 was mainly the result of higher charitable contributions and marketing promotions. Loan and lease collection and repossession expense decreased during the second quarter of 2017 and increased for the first six months of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . The reduction during the second quarter of 2017 over the same period a year ago was mainly due to decreased valuation adjustments offset by lower recoveries on repurchased mortgage loans. Loan and lease collection and expense increased for the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to higher general collection and repossession expenses and losses on the sale of repossessed assets offset by decreased valuation adjustments. Other expenses were lower during the three and six months ended June30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 . The decrease during the second quarter of 2017 over a year ago primarily related to gains on the sale of leased equipment and a decrease in the provision on unfunded loan commitments offset by increased training expenses. The decrease during the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was mainly the result of gains on the sale of leased equipment, reduced residential mortgage foreclosure expenses and swap valuation adjustments, a decrease in provision on unfunded loan commitments offset by impairment writedowns on branches to be closed in the third quarter of 2017. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes for the three and six month periods ended June30, 2017 was $9.49 million and $18.19 million, compared to $8.03 million and $15.45 million for the same periods in 2016 . The effective tax rate was 36.27% and 35.67% for the second quarter ended June30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively and 35.63% and 35.31% for the six months ended June30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
