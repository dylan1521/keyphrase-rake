ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management's discussion and analysis is presented to provide information concerning 1st Source Corporation and its subsidiaries' (collectively referred to as "the Company", "we", and "our") financial condition as of September30, 2016 , as compared to December31, 2015 , and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 . This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the financial and statistical data appearing elsewhere in this report and our 2015 Annual Report. Except for historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this document express "forward-looking statements." Generally, the words "believe," "contemplate," "seek," "plan," "possible," "assume," "expect," "intend," "targeted," "continue," "remain," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "will," "should," "indicate," "would," "may" and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Those statements, including statements, projections, estimates or assumptions concerning future events or performance, and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact, are subject to material risks and uncertainties. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We may make other written or oral forward-looking statements from time to time. Readers are advised that various important factors could cause our actual results or circumstances for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, changes in law, regulations or GAAP; our competitive position within the markets we serve; increasing consolidation within the banking industry; unforeseen changes in interest rates; unforeseen changes in loan prepayment assumptions; unforeseen downturns in or major events affecting the local, regional or national economies or the industries in which we have credit concentrations; and other matters discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form10-K for 2015 , which filings are available from the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. 29 FINANCIAL CONDITION Our total assets at September30, 2016 were $5.45 billion, an increase of $260.00 million or 5.01% from December31, 2015 . Total loans and leases were $4.18 billion, an increase of $184.73 million or 4.62% from December31, 2015 . Total investment securities, available-for-sale were $828.62 million which represented an increase of $36.89 million or 4.66% and equipment owned under operating leases was $117.88 million, an increase of $7.51 million or 6.81% from the comparable figures at December31, 2015 . Total deposits were $4.38 billion, an increase of $237.85 million or 5.75% from the end of 2015 . Short-term borrowings were $216.01 million, a decrease of $17.22 million or 7.38% from December31, 2015 . Nonperforming assets at September30, 2016 were $29.22 million, an increase of $8.60 million or 41.66% from the $20.62 million reported at December31, 2015 . At September30, 2016 and December31, 2015 , nonperforming assets were 0.68% and 0.50%, respectively of net loans and leases. The following table shows accrued income and other assets.  CAPITAL As of September30, 2016 , total shareholders' equity was $670.26 million, up $26.21 million or 4.07% from the $644.05 million at December31, 2015 . In addition to net income of $42.56 million, other significant changes in shareholders' equity during the first nine months of 2016 included $8.03 million of common stock acquired for treasury and $14.03 million of dividends paid. The accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) component of shareholders' equity totaled $9.65 million at September30, 2016 , compared to $6.56 million at December31, 2015 . The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) during 2016 was the result of changes in unrealized gain/(loss) on securities in the available-for-sale portfolio. Our equity-to-assets ratio was 12.30% as of September30, 2016 , compared to 12.41% at December31, 2015 . Book value per common share rose to $25.91 at September30, 2016 , from $24.75 at December31, 2015 . We declared and paid cash dividends per common share of $0.18 during the third quarter of 2016 . The trailing four quarters dividend payout ratio, representing cash dividends per common share divided by diluted earnings per common share, was 32.93%. The dividend payout is continually reviewed by management and the Board of Directors subject to the Company's capital and dividend policy. The banking regulators have established guidelines for leverage capital requirements, expressed in terms of Tier 1 or core capital as a percentage of average assets, to measure the soundness of a financial institution. In addition, banking regulators have established risk-based capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. The final capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2015 introduced a requirement for a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule. Institutions that do not maintain this required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital buffer requirement is being phased in over three years beginning in 2016. We have included the 0.625% increase for 2016 in our minimum capital adequacy ratios in the table below. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5%, and the total capital ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis on January 1, 2019. Management believes that, as of September30, 2016 , 1st Source and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis as if all such requirements were currently in effect. 30 The actual capital amounts and ratios of 1st Source Corporation and 1st Source Bank as of September30, 2016 , are presented in the table below. LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY Effective liquidity management ensures that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as our operating cash needs are met. Funds are available from a number of sources, including the securities portfolio, the core deposit base, access to the national brokered certificates of deposit market, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings, Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) borrowings, and the capability to package loans for sale. We have borrowing sources available to supplement deposits and meet our funding needs. 1st Source Bank has established relationships with several banks to provide short term borrowings in the form of federal funds purchased. At September30, 2016 , we had no outstandings and could borrow approximately $265.00 million for a short time from these banks on a collective basis. As of September30, 2016 , we had $83.48 million outstanding in FHLB advances and could borrow an additional $149.84 million. We also had $492.24 million available to borrow from the FRB with no amounts outstanding as of September30, 2016 . Our loan to asset ratio was 76.72% at September30, 2016 compared to 77.00% at December31, 2015 and 77.47% at September30, 2015 . Cash and cash equivalents totaled $95.82 million at September30, 2016 compared to $79.72 million at December31, 2015 and $64.19 million at September30, 2015 . At September30, 2016 , the Statement of Financial Condition was rate sensitive by $640.35 million more assets than liabilities scheduled to reprice within one year, or approximately 1.30%. Management believes that the present funding sources provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash flow needs. Under Indiana law governing the collateralization of public fund deposits, the Indiana Board of Depositories determines which financial institutions are required to pledge collateral based on the strength of their financial ratings. We have been informed that no collateral is required for our public fund deposits. However, the Board of Depositories could alter this requirement in the future and adversely impact our liquidity. Our potential liquidity exposure if we must pledge collateral is approximately $578 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net income for the three and nine month periods ended September30, 2016 was $14.26 million and $42.56 million, compared to $13.93 million and $43.07 million for the same periods in 2015 . Diluted net income per common share was $0.55 and $1.63 for the three and nine month periods ended September30, 2016 , compared to $0.53 and $1.63 for the same periods in 2015 . Return on average common shareholders' equity was 8.62% for the nine months ended September30, 2016 , compared to 9.12% in 2015 . The return on total average assets was 1.07% for the nine months ended September30, 2016 , compared to 1.16% in 2015 . Net income decreased slightly for the nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 . Net interest income and noninterest income increased offset by an increase in provision for loan and lease losses, noninterest expense and income tax expense. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed further below. 31 NET INTEREST INCOME The following tables provide an analysis of net interest income and illustrates the interest income earned and interest expense charged for each major component of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Yields/rates are computed on a tax-equivalent basis, using a 35% rate. Nonaccrual loans and leases are included in the average loan and lease balance outstanding. DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL (1) See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" at the end of this section for additional information on this performance measure/ratio. Quarter Ended September30, 2016 compared to the Quarter Ended September30, 2015  The taxable equivalent net interest income for the three months ended September30, 2016 was $43.14 million, an increase of 1.22% over the same period in 2015 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.39% for the three months ended September30, 2016 , compared to 3.57% for the three months ended September30, 2015 . During the three month period ended September30, 2016 , average earning assets increased $333.04 million or 7.04% over the comparable period in 2015 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $244.82 million or 7.02%. The yield on average earning assets decreased 13 basis points to 3.83% from 3.96% primarily due to lower rates on loans and leases and investment securities available-for-sale. Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 8 basis points to 0.60% from 0.52%. The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was a decrease of 18 basis points. The largest contributors to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets for the three months ended September30, 2016 , compared to the three months ended September30, 2015 , was a reduction in yields on net loans and leases of 4 basis points and a reduction in yields on investment securities available-for-sale of 59 basis points due to market conditions. Average net loans and leases increased $278.36 million or 7.12%. Total average investment securities increased $39.10 million or 5.00%. Average mortgages held for sale increased $5.07 million or 52.77%. Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and commercial paper, increased $10.51 million or 34.16%. 32 Average interest-bearing deposits increased $286.35 million or 9.22% for the third quarter of 2016 over the same period in 2015 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits increased 8 basis points to 0.45% from 0.37%. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily the result of higher rates on certificates of deposit. Average short-term borrowings decreased $48.74 million or 18.31% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 5 basis points. Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $7.21 million or 12.55%. Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities decreased 49 basis points. The decrease was due to lower rates on mandatorily redeemable securities. DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL (1) See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" at the end of this section for additional information on this performance measure/ratio. Nine Months Ended  September30, 2016 compared to the Nine Months Ended  September30, 2015  The taxable equivalent net interest income for the nine months ended September30, 2016 was $127.65 million, an increase of 2.49% over the comparable period in 2015 . The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.43% for the nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to a net interest margin of 3.60% for the same period in 2015 . During the nine month period ended September30, 2016 , average earning assets increased $345.49 million or 7.47% over the comparable period in 2015 . Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $248.42 million or 7.23%. The yield on average earning assets decreased 10 basis points to 3.88% from 3.98%. The rate earned on assets decreased during 2016 over 2015 partially due to lower net interest recoveries of $1.46 million or 4 basis points largely related to one commercial loan relationship. Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 9 basis points to 0.61% from 0.52%. The result to the net interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was a decrease of 17 basis points. 33 The largest contributor to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets for the nine months ended September30, 2016 , compared to the nine months ended September30, 2015 , was a reduction in yields on net loans and leases of 10 basis points due to the aforementioned net interest recoveries in 2015 which impacted the yield on net loans and leases by 6 basis points. Average net loans and leases increased $305.36 million or 8.04%. Total average investment securities increased $19.63 million or 2.49%. Average other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and commercial paper, increased $20.87 million or 65.55%. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $264.91 million or 8.61% for the first nine months of 2016 over the same period in 2015 . The effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits increased 10 basis points to 0.46% compared to 0.36%. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was primarily the result of higher rates on certificates of deposit and accelerated discount amortization on called brokered certificates of deposit during the first quarter of 2016 . Average short-term borrowings decreased $23.65 million or 9.79% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Interest paid on short-term borrowings increased 5 basis points. The decrease in short-term borrowings was primarily the result of decreased borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB). Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities increased $7.16 million or 12.53%. Interest paid on long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities decreased 2 basis points. The decrease was due to lower rates on long-term debt. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The accounting and reporting policies of 1st Source conform to generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company's performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components) and net interest margin (including its individual components). Management believes that these measures provide users of the Company's financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. PROVISION AND RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES  The provision for loan and lease losses for the three and nine month periods ended September30, 2016 was $2.07 million and $5.09 million compared to a provision for loan and lease losses in the three and nine month periods ended September30, 2015 of $0.99 million and $2.16 million respectively. Net charge offs of $4.63 million were recorded for the third quarter 2016 , compared to net recoveries of $0.04 million for the same quarter a year ago. Year-to-date net charge offs of $4.31 million have been recorded in 2016 , compared to net recoveries of $0.39 million through September30, 2015 . 34 We believe geopolitical events have the potential to negatively impact the U.S. economy. Current concerns include the ongoing corruption scandals and political uncertainty in Latin American countries and the heightened concerns globally of terrorist attacks. We include a factor in our loss ratios for the global risk, as we are increasingly aware of the threat that global concerns may affect our customers. While we are unable to determine with any precision the impact of global economic and political issues on our loan portfolios, we feel the risks are real and significant. We believe there is a risk of negative consequences for our borrowers that would affect their ability to repay their financial obligations. Therefore, we continue to include a factor for global risk in our analysis for the third quarter of 2016. Another area of concern continues to be our aircraft portfolio where we have a collateral concentration and $243 million in foreign exposure. The aircraft industry was among the sectors affected most by the sluggish economy. Once again, we are noting softening collateral values, particularly for private jets. We remain concerned about the prolonged low prices for several models. We also have some foreign exposure in this portfolio, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. Brazil is suffering from its worst recession in twenty-five years. We continue to monitor individual customer performance and assess risks in the portfolio as a whole. We do not see a clear trend of improvement or deterioration. We have assessed our reserve ratios, which were established based on the higher and more volatile loss histories and believe our reserve ratios remain appropriate. On September30, 2016 , 30 day and over loan and lease delinquencies as a percentage of loan and lease outstandings were 0.23% compared to 0.46% on September30, 2015 . The decrease in delinquencies is largely attributable to the aircraft and consumer portfolios. The reserve for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding at the end of the period was 2.13% as compared to 2.22% one year ago. A summary of loan and lease loss experience during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 is located in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. A loan or lease is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. We evaluate loans and leases exceeding $100,000 for impairment and establish a specific reserve as a component of the reserve for loan and lease losses when it is probable all amounts due will not be collected pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan or lease and the recorded investment in the loan or lease exceeds its fair value. A summary of impaired loans as of September30, 2016 and December31, 2015 is reflected in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. NONPERFORMING ASSETS  The following table shows nonperforming assets.  Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and leases were 0.68% at September30, 2016 , 0.50% at December31, 2015 , and 0.66% at September30, 2015 . Nonperforming assets totaled $29.22 million at September30, 2016 , an increase of 41.66% from the $20.62 million reported at December31, 2015 , and a 8.65% increase from the $26.89 million reported at September30, 2015 . The increase in nonperforming assets during the first nine months of 2016 was related to an increase in nonaccrual loans and leases, repossessions and loans and leases past due 90 days or more offset by a decrease in equipment owned under operating leases and sales of other real estate. The increase in nonperforming assets at September30, 2016 from September30, 2015 occurred primarily in nonaccrual loans and leases and repossessions. The increase in loans past due 90 days or more at September30, 2016 from December31, 2015 occurred in the residential real estate and home equity portfolio. The increase in nonaccrual loans and leases at September30, 2016 from December31, 2015 occurred primarily in the aircraft, commercial real estate, consumer, and construction equipment portfolios offset by decreases in the commercial and agricultural and residential real estate and home equity portfolios. The increase in nonaccrual loans and leases at September30, 2016 from September30, 2015 occurred primarily in the commercial real estate, aircraft, consumer, and construction equipment portfolios offset by decreases in the commercial and agricultural and residential real estate and home equity portfolios. A summary of nonaccrual loans and leases and past due aging for the period ended September30, 2016 and December31, 2015 is located in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other real estate is the result of foreclosing on real estate in the local market for which we have a current appraisal and are well secured. Other real estate increased slightly over the past year due to current foreclosures outpacing sales of existing properties. 35 Repossessions consisted mainly of aircraft financing. At the time of repossession, the recorded amount of the loan or lease is written down to the fair value of the equipment or vehicle by a charge to the reserve for loan and lease losses or other income, if a positive adjustment, unless the equipment is in the process of immediate sale. Any subsequent fair value write-downs or write-ups, to the extent of previous write-downs, are included in noninterest expense. The following table shows a summary of other real estate and repossessions.  For financial statement purposes, nonaccrual loans and leases are included in loan and lease outstandings, whereas repossessions and other real estate are included in other assets. Foreign Outstandings - Our foreign loan and lease outstandings, all denominated in U.S. dollars were $242.88 million and $205.83 million as of September30, 2016 and December31, 2015 , respectively. Foreign loans and leases are in aircraft financing. Loan and lease outstandings to borrowers in Brazil and Mexico were $95.58 million and $135.64 million as of September30, 2016 , respectively, compared to $76.79 million and $116.73 million as of December31, 2015 , respectively. As of September30, 2016 and December31, 2015 there was not a significant concentration in any other country. NONINTEREST INCOME The following table shows the details of noninterest income. NM = Not Meaningful Trust fees were relatively flat during the three months ended September30, 2016 and during the first nine months of 2016 compared with the same periods a year ago. Trust fees are largely based on the number and size of client relationships and the market value of assets under management. The market value of trust assets under management at September30, 2016 and December31, 2015 was $4.08 billion and $3.78 billion, respectively. Service charges on deposit accounts declined for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 over the comparable periods in 2015. The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts primarily reflects a lower volume of nonsufficient fund transactions and a decrease in paper statement fees as clients continue to move to online access for account statements. Debit card income increased in the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 over the same periods a year ago. The improvement in debit card income was mainly the result of an increased volume of debit card transactions in 2016 . 36 Mortgage banking income increased in the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 as compared to the same periods a year ago. The increase in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 was caused by increased gains on loan sales and higher secondary market loan production offset by a decrease in servicing fees. The slight increase for the first nine months of 2016 compared with the same period a year ago was primarily caused by increased gains on loan sales offset by lower secondary market production and a reduction in loan servicing fees. Insurance commissions declined during the three months ended September30, 2016 over the same period a year ago. The decrease in insurance commissions was primarily due to a smaller book of business in the third quarter of 2016. Insurance commissions were flat for the nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 . Equipment rental income grew for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 over the comparable periods in 2015. The increase was the result of the average equipment rental portfolio increasing 29.32% over the same period a year ago due to improving market conditions for equipment finance mainly in auto and light trucks and construction equipment. The increase in equipment rental income was offset by a similar increase in depreciation on equipment owned under operating leases. Gains on investment securities available-for-sale during the three months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 resulted from the sale of marketable equity securities. Gains on investment securities available-for-sale during the first nine months of 2016 compared with the same period a year ago resulted from the sale of marketable equity securities and U.S. States and political subdivisions securities offset by an other than temporary impairment charge of $0.29 million on a marketable equity security. Other income decreased for the three months ended September30, 2016 over the same period a year ago as a result of lower monogram fund income and decreased customer swap fees. Other income increased during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. The increased income was mainly due to gains on the liquidation of a partnership investment required by the Volcker Rule and higher mutual fund income offset by lower monogram fund income, decreased customer swap fees and a reduction in claim proceeds from bank owned life insurance. NONINTEREST EXPENSE The following table shows the details of noninterest expense. Salaries and employee benefits increased for the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 . The increase in 2016 was mainly due to higher base salary expense offset by decreased group insurance costs. Higher base salary expense was primarily due to normal performance raises. Group insurance costs decreased as a result of overall lower health insurance claims experience. Net occupancy expense decreased slightly during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods a year ago. Furniture and equipment expense, including depreciation, increased during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 . Furniture and equipment expense was higher in 2016 mainly due to increased software maintenance costs and depreciation on new equipment with banking center remodels. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 , depreciation on leased equipment increased in conjunction with the increase in equipment rental income as compared to the same periods one year ago. 37 Professional fees were flat during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. Professional fees grew during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 mainly due to higher legal fees offset by lower audit fees. Supplies and communication expense decreased slightly during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago and increased slightly for the first nine months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. FDIC and other insurance decreased during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods a year ago. The decrease in 2016 was mainly due to lower assessments as a result of the Deposit Insurance Fund's reserve ratio exceeding the FDIC's established benchmark at the end of the second quarter. Business development and marketing expense increased slightly during the third quarter of 2016 and decreased for the nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods a year ago. The lower expense for 2016 was primarily the result of decreased marketing promotions. Loan and lease collection and repossession expense decreased during the third quarter of 2016 and increased for the nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 . The decrease during the third quarter of 2016 over the same period a year ago was primarily due to decreased valuation adjustments offset by lower recoveries on repurchased mortgage loans and higher collection and repossession expenses. Loan and lease collection and repossession expense increased for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 mainly due to fewer gains on the sale of other real estate owned and repossessions and lower recoveries on repurchased mortgage loans offset by decreased valuation adjustments. Other expenses were lower during the three and nine months ended September30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 . The decrease during the third quarter of 2016 over a year ago primarily related to reduced residential mortgage foreclosure expenses, a decrease in provision on unfunded loan commitments and fewer write-downs on fixed assets, offset by higher ATM losses. The decrease during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was mainly the result of reduced residential mortgage foreclosure expenses, writedowns of fixed assets and expenses related to a previously reported proceeding that involved the Bank as trustee in 2015 not present in 2016, a decrease in employment and relocation expenses, and reduced intangible asset amortization as items fully amortize offset by higher ATM losses, increased provision on unfunded loan commitments and reduced gains on the sale of operating lease equipment. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes for the three and nine month periods ended September30, 2016 was $7.88 million and $23.33 million respectively, compared to $7.35 million and $23.13 million for the same periods in 2015 . The effective tax rates were 35.59% and 34.55% for the third quarters ended September30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively and 35.41% and 34.94% for the nine months ended September30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.
