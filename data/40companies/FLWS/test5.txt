They do not include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine month periods ended April 2, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending July 2, 2017. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2016.     The Company 's quarterly results may experience seasonal fluctuations. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company's business, and its continued expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through Christmas holiday season, which falls within the Company's second fiscal quarter, is expected to generate nearly 50% of the Company's annual revenues, and all of its earnings. Additionally, due to the number of major floral gifting occasions, including Mother's Day, Valentine's Day and Administrative Professionals Week, revenues also rise during the Company's fiscal third and fourth quarters in comparison to its fiscal first quarter. In fiscal 2016, the Easter Holiday was on March 27th, and as a result, all revenue and EBITDA associated with this holiday was within the Company's fiscal third quarter. In fiscal 2017, Easter falls on April 16th, which will result in the shift ofassociatedrevenue and EBITDA from the Company's third quarter to its fourth quarter.     Use of Estimates     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanyin g notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers." This amended guidance will enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices and will be applied to all contracts with customers. Expanded disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized are requirements under the amended guidance. This guidance will be effective for the Company's fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 and may be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.     In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, " Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs," which amends ASC 835-30, "Interest   Imputation of Interest." In order to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs, ASU No. 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, and not recorded as a separate asset. The Company adopted this standard effective July 4, 2016 and applied it retrospectively to all periods presented. The impact of the adoption of the new guidance was to reclassify $3.6 million of deferred financing costs previously included within "Other Assets" to "Long-term debt" in the consolidated balance sheets as of July 3, 2016.     In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, " Inventory (Topic 330)." The pronouncement was issued to simplify the measurement of inventory and changes the measurement from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending July 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.     In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, &quot;Financial Instruments   Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." The pronouncement requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. These changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. The adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.     In February 201 6, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)." Under this guidance, an entity is required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This guidance is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending June 28, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." ASU No. 2016-09 affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. ASU No. 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company has elected to early adopt the amendments in ASU 2016-09, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. As a result, stock-based compensation excess tax benefits are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of the provision for income taxes, whereas they were previously recognized in equity. This change resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits against income tax expenses, rather than additional paid-in capital, of $0.1 million and $0.9 million for the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017. There wasnoimpact on earnings per share sinceapproximately 700,000 tax benefit shares for thenine months ended April 2, 2017, previously associated with the APIC pool calculation, are no longer considered in the diluted share computation. Additionally, our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows now present excess tax benefits as an operating activity. This change has been applied prospectively in accordance with the ASU and prior periods have not been adjusted. Further, the Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures. The cumulative effect of this change, which was recorded as compensation expensein fiscal 2017, was not material to the financial statements. In addition, this ASU allows entities to withhold an amount up to an employees' maximum individual statutory tax rate in the relevant jurisdiction, up from the minimum statutory requirement, without resulting in liability classification of the award. We adopted this change on a modified retrospective basis, with no impact to our consolidated financial statements. Finally, this ASU clarified that the cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. This change does not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financials as it conforms with its current practice.          5        In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, " Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." ASU 2016-13 introduces a new forward-looking "expected loss" approach, to estimate credit losses on most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade receivables. The estimate of expected credit losses will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity's assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending July 4, 2021, and the guidance is to be applied using the modified-retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.      In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, &quot;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business (ASU 2017-01),&quot; which revises the definition of a business and provides new guidance in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. ASU 2017-01 is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied  prospectively, We do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.     In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, &quot;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04),&quot; which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017- 04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending July 4, 2021, with early adoption permitted,and should be applied prospectively. We do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.    Reclassifications     Certain balances in the prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. See " Recent Accounting Pronouncements" above regarding the impact of our adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-17.     Note 2   Net IncomePer Common Share     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share:         Note (1): The effect of options to purchase 0.0 and 0.1 million shares for the three and nine months ended April 2 , 2017 and 0.1 million shares for both the three and nine months ended March 27, 2016, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of net income per share on a diluted basis as their effect is anti-dilutive.     Note (2): As a result of the net loss from continuing operations attributable to 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. for the three months ended April 2, 2017 and March 27, 2016, there is no dilutive impact to the net loss per share calculation for the respective periods.         6        Note 3   Stock-Based Compensation     The Company has a Long Term Incentive and Share Award Plan, which is more fully described in Note 12 and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company 's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2016, that provides for the grant to eligible employees, consultants and directors of stock options, restricted shares, and other stock-based awards.     The amounts of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the periods presented are as follows:         Stock-based compensation is recorded within the following line items of operating expenses:         The following table summarizes stock option activity during the nine months ended April 2, 2017 (unaudited) :         As of April 2, 2017, the total future compensation cost related to non-vested options, not yet recognized in the statement of income, was $1.0 million and the weighted average period over which these awards are expected to be recognized was 2.2years.     The Company grants shares of Common Stock to its employees that are subject to r estrictions on transfer and risk of forfeiture until fulfillment of applicable service and performance conditions and, in certain cases, holding periods (Restricted Stock). The following table summarizes the activity of non-vested restricted stock awards during thenine months ended April 2, 2017 (unaudited) :         The fair value of non-vested shares is determined based on the closing stock price on the grant date. As of April 2, 2017, there was $6.9million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock-based compensation to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining period of 2.2 years.      7          Note 4 - Dispositions     Pending disposition of Fannie May     On March 15, 2017, the Company  and Ferrero International S.A., a Luxembourg corporation ("Ferrero"), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which Ferrero will purchase from the Company all of the outstanding equity of Fannie May Confections Brands, Inc., including its subsidiaries, Fannie May Confections, Inc. and Harry London Candies, Inc. ("Fannie May") (the "Acquisition"). The aggregate consideration payable to the Company in exchange for all of the outstanding equity of Fannie May is $115.0 million in cash (subject to adjustment for seasonal working capital).  The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company and F errero. The closing of the Acquisition is expected tobe onMay 30, 2017 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals, covenants to enter into a transition services agreement whereby the Company will provide certain post-closing services to Ferrero and Fannie May related to the business of Fannie May and a commercial agreement with respect to the distribution of certain Ferrero and Fannie May products.     The Company determined that the Fannie May business (disposal group) met the held for sale criteria, as prescribed by FASB ASC 360-10-45-9, but did not meet the criteria to qualify as a discontinued operation. Further, per ASC 360-10-35-43, a disposal group classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell . The Company compared Fannie May'scarrying amountto its fair value less estimated costs to sell, and determined thatthe disposal group should be measured at its carrying amountas of April 2, 2017.     The assets and liabilities of Fannie May are presented as "Assets held for sale" and "Liabilities held for sale"in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets as of April 2, 2017. The following table presents the aggregate carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities related to the Fannie May business to be disposed of as of April 2, 2017:         Note (1) - Per FASB ASC 350-20-40, when a portion of reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with that business shall be included in the carrying amount of the business in determining the gain or loss on disposal. The amount of goodwill to be included in that carrying amount shall be based on the relative fair values of the business to be disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained. Fannie May represents a business as defined by FASB and is included in the Company's Gourmet Food &amp; Gift Baskets reporting unit. As a result, we allocated goodwill of $14.9 million to the Fannie May business based on the relative fair value of Fannie May to the remaining Gourmet Food &amp; Gift Baskets reporting unit. The Company estimated the fair value of the Gourmet Food &amp; Gift Baskets reporting unit in a manner consistent with its significant accounting policy for goodwill, described in Item 15, Note 1 of the  Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2016.     Disposition of Colonial Gifts Limited (&quot;iFlorist&quot;)     During the quarter ended September 27, 2015, the Company 's management committed to a plan to sell its iFlorist business in order to focus its internal resources and capital on integrating and achieving synergy savings with respect to its acquisition of Harry & David, which was completed on September 30, 2014. As a result, the Company determined that the iFlorist business (disposal group) met the held for sale criteria, as prescribed by FASB ASC 360-10-45-9, as of September 27, 2015. As such, the Company compared iFlorist's carrying amount ($3.4 million) to its fair value less cost to sell ($1.5 million), and recorded an impairment charge of $1.9 million during the period ended September 27, 2015. The Company recorded this impairment charge within "Other (income) expense, net" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During October 2015, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of iFlorist to Euroflorist AB ("Euroflorist"), a pan-European floral and gifting company headquartered in Malmo, Sweden. As consideration for the assets sold, the Company received an investment in Euroflorist with a fair value on the date of sale of approximately $1.5 million. (The Company will account for this investment using the cost method as it does not possess the ability to exercise significant influence over Euroflorist.) Upon completion of the sale of iFlorist during the quarter ended December 27, 2015, the Company recorded an additional loss on sale of $0.2 million.             8        Note 5   Inventory     The Company 's inventory, stated at cost, which is not in excess of market, includes purchased and manufactured finished goods for sale, packaging supplies, crops, raw material ingredients for manufactured products and associated manufacturing labor and is classified as follows:         Inventories to be disposed of as a result of the Fannie May disposition were included in &quot;Assets held for sale&quot; on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of April 2, 2017, and accordingly, are not included in this table (see ).      Note 6   Goodwill and Intangible Assets     The following table presents goodwill by segment and the related change in the net carrying amount:                (1)    The total carrying amount of goodwill for all periods in the table above is reflected net of $71.1 million of accumulated impairment charges, which were recorded in the Gourmet Food & Gift Baskets segment during fiscal 2009.        The Company 's other intangible assets consist of the following:         Trademarks and customer lists to be disposed of as a result of the Fannie May disposition were included in &quot;Assets held for sale&quot; on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of April 2, 2017, and accordingly, are not included in this table (see ).      Intangible assets are reviewed for impairmen t whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Future estimated amortization expense is as follows: remainder of fiscal 2017 - $0.4million, fiscal 2018 - $1.3 million, fiscal 2019 - $0.7 million, fiscal 2020 - $0.6 million, fiscal 2021 - $0.6million and thereafter - $3.1million.      9        Note 7   Investments     The Company has certain investments in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies. The Company accounts for these investments using the equity method if they provide the Company the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company has an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on the investee's Board of Directors, are considered in determining whether the equity method is appropriate. The Company records equity method investments initially at cost, and adjusts the carrying amount to reflect the Company's share of the earnings or losses of the investee.     The Company 's equity method investmentiscomprised of a 29.0% interest in Flores Online, a Sao Paulo,Brazil based internet floral and gift retailer, that the Company made on May 31, 2012. The book value of this investment was $1.1 million as of April 2, 2017 and July 3, 2016, and is included in the "Other assets" line item within the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company's equity in the net loss of Flores Online for the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017and March 27, 2016was less than $0.1 million. During the quarter ended September 27, 2015, the Company determined that the fair value of its investment in Flores Online ($1.2 million) was below its carrying value ($2.9 million) and that this decline was other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 million, which is included within the "Other (income) expense, net" line items in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the nine-months ended March 27, 2016.     Investments in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, where the Company does not possess the ability to exercise significa nt influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Cost method investments are originally recorded at cost, and are included within the "Other assets" line item within the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate carrying amount of the Company's cost method investments was $1.7 million (including a $1.5 million investment in Euroflorist   see ) as of April 2, 2017and July 3, 2016.     The Company also holds certain trading securities associated with its Non-Qualified Deferred C ompensation Plan ("NQDC Plan"). These investments are measured using quoted market prices at the reporting date and are included within the "Other assets" line item in the condensed consolidated balance sheets (see ).     Each reporting period, the Company uses available qualitative and quantitative information to evaluate its investments for impairment. When a decline in fair value, if any, is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.     Note 8  Debt     The Company 's current and long-term debt consists of the following:         (1) On December 23, 2016 , the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "2016 Amended Credit Agreement")  with JPMorgan Chase Bank as administrative agent, and a group of lenders. The 2016 Amended Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company 's credit agreementdated as of September 30, 2014(the "2014 Agreement")  to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the $115.0 million outstanding term loan (&quot;Term Loan&quot;) and the revolving credit facility (the &quot;Revolver&quot;) by approximately two years to December 23, 2021. The Term Loan is payable in 19 quarterly installments of principal and interest beginning on April 2, 2017, with escalating principal payments, at the rate of 5% in year one, 7.5% in year two, 10% in year three, 12.5% in year four, and 15% in year five, with the remaining balance of $61.8 million due upon maturity. The Revolver, in the aggregate amount of $200 million, subject to seasonal reduction to an aggregate amount of $100 million for the period from January 1 through August 1, may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, subject to certain restrictions.     For each borrowing under the 2016 Amended Credit Agreement, the Company may elect that such borrowing bear interest at an annual rate equal to either (1) a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from  0.75% to 1.5%, based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio, where the base rate is the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b)the highest of thefederal funds rate and the overnight bank funding rate as published by the New York Fed,plus 0.5% and (c) an adjustedLIBO rate,plus 1% or (2)an adjustedLIBO rateplus an applicable margin varying from 1.75% to 2.5%,based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio.  The 2016 Amended Credit Agreement requires that while any borrowings are outstanding the Company comply with certain financial covenants and affirmative covenants as well as certain negative covenants, that subject to certain exceptions, limit the Company's ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments and make certain restricted payments. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of April 2, 2017. The 2016 Amended Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors.     Future principal payments under the term loan are as fo llows: $1.5million   remainder of fiscal 2017, $7.2million   fiscal 2018, $10.1million   fiscal 2019, $12.9million   fiscal 2020, $15.8 million - fiscal 2021, and $66.1 million thereafter.       10        Note 9 - Property, Plant and Equipment     The Company 's property, plant and equipment consists of the following:         Property, plant and equipment to be disposed of as a result of the Fannie May disposition were included in &quot;Assets held for sale&quot; on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of April 2, 2017, and accordingly, are not included in this table (see ).      Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements     Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Although no trading market exists, the Company believes that the carrying amount of its debt approximates fair value due to its variable nature. The Company's investments in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies are carried at cost and are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment, when an event or circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred. The Company's remaining financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value (see table below). The Company's non-financial assets, such as definite lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost and are assessed for impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist, as required under the accounting standards.     Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance are described below:         Level 1          Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.                  Level 2          Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.                  Level 3          Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.        The following table presents by level, within the fair value hierarchy, financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:                   (1)    The Company has established a Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for certain members of senior management. Deferred compensation plan assets are invested in mutual funds held in a " rabbi trust" which is restricted for payment to participants of the NQDC Plan. Trading securities held in a rabbi trust are measured using quoted market prices at the reporting date and are included in the "Other assets" line item, with the corresponding liability included in the "Other liabilities" line item in the consolidated balance sheets.         11        Note 11   Income Taxes     At the end of each interim reporting period, the Company estimates its effective income tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. This estimate is used in providing for income taxes on a year-to-date basis and may change in subsequent interim periods. The Company's effective tax rate from operations for the three months and nine months ended April 2, 2017was 34.7% and 31.9% respectively, compared to 37.6% and 31.7% inthe same respective periodsof the prior year. The effective rates for fiscal 2017 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to various permanent differences and tax credits , including excess tax benefits on stock based compensation as a result of the Company's early adoption of ASU 2016-09 (see) , domestic production deductions and research and development credits, partially offset by state income taxes. The effective rate for fiscal 2016 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the domestic production deduction and various tax credits such as employment credits and research and development credits that were renewed by U.S. Congress in December 2015, as well as the impact of the Company's reduced effective foreign tax rate in the UK resulting from the sale of iFlorist in October 2015, partially offset by state income taxes.     The Company files income tax returns in the U .S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign countries. The Company concluded its U.S. federal examination for fiscal 2014, however, fiscal years 2015 and 2016 remain subject to U.S. federal examination. Due to ongoing state examinations and non-conformity with the U.S. federal statute of limitations for assessment, certain states remain open from fiscal 2012. The Company commenced operations in foreign jurisdictions in 2012. The Company's foreign income tax filings are open for examination by its respective foreign tax authorities, mainly Canada and the United Kingdom.     The Company' s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. At April 2, 2017 the Company has remaining unrecognized tax positions of approximately $0.4 million, including accrued interest and penalties of $0.1 million. The Company believes that none of its unrecognized tax positions will be resolved over the next twelve months.     Note 12   Business Segments     The Company 's management reviews the results of the Company's operations by the following three business segments:       1-800-Flowers.com Consumer Floral,    BloomNet Wire Service, and    Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets     Segment performance is measured based on contribution margin, which includes only the direct controllable revenue and operating expe nses of the segments. As such, management's measure of profitability for these segments does not include the effect of corporate overhead (see (a) below), nor does it include depreciation and amortization, other (income) expense, net and income taxes, or stock-based compensation and certain acquisition/integration costs, both of which are included within corporate overhead. Assets and liabilities are reviewed at the consolidated level by management and not accounted for by segment.                   (a) Corporate expenses consist of the Company's enterprise shared service cost centers, and include, among other items, Information Technology, Human Resources, Accounting and Finance, Legal, Executive and Customer Service Center functions, as well as Stock-Based Compensation. In order to leverage the Company's infrastructure, these functions are operated under a centralized management platform, providing support services throughout the organization. The costs of these functions, other than those of the Customer Service Center, which are allocated directly to the above categories based upon usage, are included within corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific segment.         12        Note 13   Commitments and Contingencies     Litigation     There are various claims, lawsuits, and pending actions against the Company and its subsidiaries incident to the operations of its businesses. It is the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, that the ultimate resolution of such claims, lawsuits and pending actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.     Note 14. Fire at the Fannie May Warehouse and Distribution Facility     On November 27, 2014, a fire occurred at the Company's Maple Heights, Ohio warehouse and distribution facility. While the fire did not cause any injuries, the building was severely damaged, rendering it inoperable for the holiday season, and all Fannie May and Harry London confections in the facility were destroyed. As a result, the Company had limited supplies of its Fannie May Fine Chocolates and Harry London Chocolates products available in its retail stores as well as for its ecommerce and wholesale channels during its fiscal 2015 holiday season. While the Company implemented contingency plans to increase production for Fannie May Fine Chocolates and Harry London Chocolates products at its production facility in Canton, Ohio and to shift warehousing and distribution operations to alternate Company facilities, product availability was severely limited, impacting revenue and earnings during fiscal 2015, and lingering into fiscal 2016.     The following table reflects the costs related to the fire andthe insurance recovery and associated gain as of September 27, 2015:         During the three months ended September 27, 2015, the Company and its insurance carrier reached final agreement, and during the three months ended December 27, 2015, the Company received all remaining proceeds from its Fannie May fire claim. The agreement, in the amount of $55.0 million, provided for: (i) recovery of raw materials and work-in-process at replacement cost, and finished goods at selling price, less costs to complete the sale and normal discounts and other charges, as well as (ii) other incremental fire-related costs. The cost of inventory lost in the fire was approximately $29.6 million, while other fire-related costs amounted to approximately $5.8 million, including incremental contracted lease and cold storage fees which was incurred until the Company moved back into its leased facility. The resulting gain of $19.6 million is included in "Other (income) expense, net" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations fornine monthsended March 27, 2016.               13        ITEM 2.

Shares in 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, ticker symbol: FLWS.      14        Category Information     The following table presents the net revenues, gross profit and category contribution margin from each of the Company 's business segments, as well as consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income. (Due to certain one-time items, the following Non-GAAP reconciliation tables have been included within MD&A. In order to present comparable information, certain financial information for the nine months ended March 27, 2016,is also being presented on a pro-forma basis.)             15                    16       Reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted income (loss) attributable to 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.:          17        Reconciliation of GAAP income (loss) attributable to 1-800-Flowers.com, Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA, excluding stock-based compensation (b):               (a)    Corporate expenses consist of the Company 's enterprise shared service cost centers, and include, among other items, Information Technology, Human Resources, Accounting and Finance, Legal, Executive and Customer Service Center functions, as well as Stock-Based Compensation. In order to leverage the Company's infrastructure, these functions are operated under a centralized management platform, providing support services throughout the organization. The costs of these functions, other than those of the Customer Service Center, which are allocated directly to the above categories based upon usage, are included within corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific segment.           (b)    Performance is me asured based on segment contribution margin or segment Adjusted EBITDA, reflecting only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the segments. As such, management's measure of profitability for these segments does not include the effect of corporate overhead, described above, depreciation and amortization, other income (net), nor does it include one-time charges or gains. Management utilizes EBITDA, and adjusted financial information, as a performance measurement tool because it considers such information a meaningful supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization. The Company also uses EBITDA and adjusted financial information as one of the factors used to determine the total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees. The Company's credit agreement uses EBITDA and adjusted financial information to measure compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence. EBITDA and adjusted financial information is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates. EBITDA and adjusted financial information have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs; (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Company's debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should only be used on a supplemental basis combined with GAAP results when evaluating the Company's performance.               18        Results of Operations      Net Revenues       Net revenues consist primarily of the selling price of the merchandise, service or outbound shipping charges, less discounts, returns and credits.      Net revenues during the three months ended April 2, 2017 were consistent with the same period of the prior year. This reflects lower year-over-year revenues in the Company' s Gourmet Food& Gift Baskets segment, primarily due to the impact of the Easter holiday shifting into the Company's fiscal fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, compared toFiscal 2016,when Easter was in the Company's fiscal third quarter. The unfavorable revenues within the Gourmet Food& Gift Baskets segmentwere largelyoffset by strong revenue growth in the Company's Consumer Floral and BloomNet segments,driven by "everyday" gifting and leveraging the benefit of the favorable placement of the Valentine's Day holiday. Net revenues increased 1.6% during the nine months ended April 2, 2017, compared to the same period of the prior year,as a result ofgrowth within the Company's Consumer Floral and BloomNet segments, due to "everyday" gifting and the favorable placement of the Valentine's Day holiday, partiallyoffset by lower revenue within the Company's Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segment due to the impact of the Easter holiday shift, in addition toa reductionin the number ofHarry & David seasonalkiosks and pop-up locationsand the closure of several underperformingretail stores. The revenue impact of the shift of the Easter holiday onthe threeand nine months ended April 2, 2017, in comparison to the same periods of the prior year, is approximately $13.0 million.     E-commerce revenues (combined online and telephonic) decreased by 0.9% during the three months ended April 2, 2017, compared to the same period of the prior year, as a result of lower year-over-year revenues in the Company's Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segment, primarily due to the impact of the Easter holiday shifting into the Company's fiscal fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, compared to Fiscal 2016, when Easter was in the Company's fiscal third quarter. This impact was largely offset by strong revenue growth in the Company's Consumer Floral segment, primarily attributable to the favorable placement of the Valentine's Day holiday. E-commerce revenues increased 1.3%, during the nine months ended April 2, 2017, compared to the same period of the prior year, as a result of growth in the Company's Consumer Floral segment, primarily attributable to increases in "everyday" volume, as well as the favorable placement of the Valentine's Day holiday.Growth within theConsumer Floral segmentwas partially offset by lower revenues within the Gourmet Food& Gift Baskets segment, primarily due to the impact of the Easter holiday shifting into the Company's fiscal fourth quarter this year. During the three months ended April 2, 2017, the Company fulfilled approximately 2,703,000 orders through its e-commerce sales channels (online and telephonic sales) at an average value of $65.75, compared to approximately 2,860,000 orders at an average order value of $62.74 during the same period of the prior year. During the nine months ended April 2, 2017, the Company fulfilled approximately 9,395,000 orders through its e-commerce sales channels (online and telephonic sales) at an average order value of $75.08, compared toapproximately 9,550,000 orders at an average value of $72.92 during the same period of the prior year.     Other revenues are comprised of the Company' s BloomNet Wire Service segment, as well as the wholesale and retail channels of its 1-800-Flowers.com Consumer Floral and Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segments. Other revenues increased by 2.2% and 2.7% during the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year, as a result of wholesale growth within the Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segment and membership and ancillary service increases within the Bloomnet segment, partially offset by the timing of the Easter holiday and a reduction in the number ofHarry & David seasonalkiosks and pop-up locationsand the closure of several underperformingretail stores.     The 1-800-Flowers.com Consumer Floral segment includes the operations of the 1-800-Flowers.com brand, which derives revenue from the sale of consumer floral products through its e-commerce sales channels (telephonic and online sales), retail stores, and r oyalties from its franchise operations, as well as iFlorist, a UK based e-commerce retailer of floral products (through the date of its disposition in October 2015).Net revenues increased 10.2% and 6.0%, during the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017, in comparison to the same periods of the prior year, primarily as a result higher order volumedriven by the Company's ability to leverage theTuesday date placement of Valentine's Day, in comparison to the prior yearwhen Valentine's Day fell on a Sunday, as well asenhanced merchandise assortments, including the Flirty Feline  floral arrangement, and efforts to increase its "everyday" business, including birthdays, anniversaries, sympathy and "just because," partially offset by the timing of the Easter holiday, which shiftedapproximately $2.5 millionof revenue into the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017.     The BloomNet Wire Service segment inc ludes revenues from membership fees as well as other product and service offerings to florists. Net revenues increased 7.0% and 2.9%during the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017, respectively,compared to the same periods of the prior year, primarilydue toincreased order volumes, partly due to the favorable Valentine's Day placement, and an expanded offering of digital marketing and advertising programs. Growth during the nine months ended April 2, 2017 was partially offset by a decline in wholesale products, due to unfavorable Christmas holiday volume.     The Gourmet Food &amp; Gift Baskets segment includes the operations of Harry &amp; David, Wolferman' s, Stockyards, Cheryl's, Fannie May, Harry London, The Popcorn Factory and 1-800-Baskets/DesignPac. Revenue is derived from the sale of gourmet fruits, cookies, baked gifts, premium chocolates and confections, gourmet popcorn, gift baskets, and prime steaks and chops through the Company's e-commerce sales channels (telephonic and online sales) and company-owned and operated retail stores under the Harry & David, Cheryl's and Fannie May brand names, as well as wholesale operations. Net revenues decreased 13.6% and 0.5% during the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017, compared to the same period of the prior year,as a result of the timing of the Easter holiday, which shifted approximately $10.5 million of revenue into the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, as well as the timing of some Harry & David revenues related to the brand's Fruit of the Month Club shipments and a reduction in the number of Harry & David seasonalkiosks and pop-up locationsand the closure of several underperformingretail stores , partially offset by e-commerce revenue growth across most brands, as well as higher wholesale volumes within the Fannie May, Harry & David and DesignPac brands.      19        Gross Profit         Gross profit consists of net revenues less cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of florist fulfillment costs (fees paid directly to florists), the cost of floral and non-floral merchandise sold from inventory or through third parties, and associ ated costs including inbound and outbound shipping charges. Additionally, cost of revenues include labor and facility costs related to direct-to-consumer and wholesale production operations.   Gross profit decreased 3.2% during the three months ended April 2, 2017, compared to the same period of the prior year, as a result of the aforementioned revenue decline and a 130 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage, both the result of the later Easter, which shifted higher margin e-commerce and retail revenues into the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, in comparison toFiscal 2016when Easter fell in the third quarter. Gross profit increased 1.2% during the nine months ended April 2, 2017, compared to the same period of the prior year, as a result of the aforementioned revenue growth within the Consumer Floral and BloomNet segments, partially offset by a 20 basis point decline in gross margin percentage attributable to the Gourmet Food & Gift Baskets segment.     The 1-800-Flowers.com Consumer Floral segment gross profit increased by 10.0% and 7.5%, respectively, during the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017, in comparison to the same periods of the prior year, due to the revenue growth noted above. Gross margin percentageof 40.6%for the three months ended April 2, 2017 wasconsistent with the same period of the prior year, but increased60 basis points to 40.8%, during the nine months ended April 2, 2017, as a result of improved product sourcing andreductions in shipping costs, due to improvements in ground transportation coverage.     The BloomNet Wire Service segment gross profit during the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017 increased by 4.2% and 4.7%, respective ly, in comparisonto the same periods of the prior year, due to the revenue increase referred to above. During the three months and nine months ended April 2, 2017, gross margin percentage was 53.6% and 56.5%, respectively, representing a decrease of 140 basis points, and an increase of 100 basis points, during the same periods of the prior year, as a result of product mix.     The Gourmet Food &amp; G ift Baskets segment gross profit decreased 21.7% and 1.8%, while gross margin percentage declined 360 and 60 basis points,during the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017, compared to the same periods of the prior year, as a result of the aforementioned shift of the Easter Holiday, while gross margin percentage was also impacted by channel and product mix, and a decline in manufacturing productivity.     Marketing and Sales Expense         Marketing and sales expense consists primarily of advertising and promotional expenditures, catalog costs, online portal and search costs, retail store and fulfillment operations (other than costs included in cost of revenues) and customer service center expenses, as well as the operating expenses of the Company's departments engaged in marketing, selling and merchandising activities.     Marketing and sales expenses decreased 1.9% during the three months ended April 2, 2017, primarily due to the shift of advertising and variable costs associated with the Easter selling season which moved into the Company's fiscal fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, compared to Fiscal 2016,when Easter was in the Company's fiscal third quarter. A s a percentage of net revenues, marketing and sales expenses decreased 50 and 20 basis points, to 30.0% and 25.7%, during the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year, as a result of a decrease in labor costs due to a reduction in performance based bonuses, as well as reductions in labor and facility costs associated with the year-over-year decreasein the number of Harry & David seasonalkiosks and pop-up locations,and the closure of several underperformingretail stores.            20       Technology and Development Expense         Technology and development expense consists primarily of payroll and operating expenses of the Company' s information technology group, costs associated with its websites, including hosting, design, content development and maintenance and support costs related to the Company's order entry, customer service, fulfillment and database systems.

General and Administrative Expense         General and administrative expense consists of payroll and other expenses in support of the Company' s executive, finance and accounting, legal, human resources and other administrative functions, as well as professional fees and other general corporate expenses.     General and administrative expense, during the three months ended April 2, 2017, was consistent with the same period of the prior year, but increased 5.6%, during the nine months ended April 2, 2017, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily as a result of increased health insurance costs, and an increase in headcount, partially offset by lower labor costs as a result of decreases in performance based bonuses, as well as one-time Harry and David integration costs incurred during the prior year.     Depreciation and Amortization Expense         Depreciation and amortization expense for the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017 increased 12.5% and 5.7%, respectively, in comparison tothe same periods of the prior year, as a result of recent increases in capital expenditures, primarily in support of the Company's technology infrastructure.      21        Interest Expense, net         Interest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs attributable to the Company' s credit facility (see ), net of income earned on the Company's available cash balances.     Interest expense, net decreased 3.9% and 9.4% during the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017, respectively in comparison to the same periods of the prior year, due to the reduction in the outstanding Term Debt due to principal payments during the year, partially offset bya $0.3 million write-off of deferred financing costs as a result of amending theCompany's credit facility in December 2016, and an overall increase in interest rates.     Other (income) expense, net            Other (income) expense, net for the three months ended April 2, 2017 and March 27, 2016 consists primarily of income and losses resulting fromchanges in thevalue of the Company's Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan investments.  Other (income) expense, net for the nine months ended April 2, 2017 consists primarily of income from the increase in thevalue of the Company's Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan investments, partiallyoffset by a decrease in the Company's equity interest in Flores Online, while Other (income) expense, net for the nine months ended September 27, 2015 consists primarily of a $19.6 million gain on insurance recoveries related to the Fannie May warehouse fire, offset by a $2.1million impairment related to the sale ofiFlorist (see ), a $1.7 million impairment of the Company's investment in Flores Online (see ), and a decline in the value of Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan investments.  Income Taxes     The Company recorded income tax benefit of $5.9 million, and income tax expense of $16.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017, compared to an income tax benefit of $5.5 million and in come tax expense of $21.8 million, respectively during the three and nine months ended March 27, 2016.

The effective rates for fiscal 2017 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to various permanent differences and tax credits, including excess tax benefits on stock based compensation as a result of the Company's early adoption of ASU 2016-09 (see ), domestic production deductions and research and development credits, partially offset by state income taxes. The effective rate for fiscal 2016 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the domestic production deduction and various tax credits such as employment credits and research and development credits that were renewed by U.S. Congress in December 2015, as well as the impact of the Company's reduced effective foreign tax rate in the UK resulting from the sale of iFlorist in October 2015, partially offset by state income taxes.At April 2, 2017 the Company has remaining unrecognized tax positions of approximately $0.4 million, including accrued interest and penalties of $0.1 million. The Company believes that none of its unrecognized tax positions will be resolved over the next twelve months.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash Flows     At April 2, 2017, the Company had working capital of $133.0 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $56.8 million, and $87.4 million of net assets held for sale relating to the pending Fannie May transaction, compared to working capital of $45.8 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $27.8 million, at July 3, 2016.     Net cash provided by operating activities of $61.2million for the nine months ended April 2, 2017, was primarily attributable to the Company's net income during the period, adjusted by non-cash charges for depreciation/amortization and stock based compensation, partially offset byseasonal changes in working capital, including an increase in trade receivables and prepaids, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.     Net cash used in investing activities of $18.8 million for the nine months ended April 2, 2017, was primarily attributable to capital expenditures related to the Company's technology infrastructure and Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets production equipment.     Net cash used in financing activities of $13.5million for the nine months ended April 2, 2017 was primarily due tonet Term Loan repaymentsof $4.0 million, the acquisition of $8.3million of treasury stock and $1.5mm ofadditional debt issuance costs relatedto the 2016 Amended Credit Agreement  (see ). All borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility wererepaid by the end of the fiscal second quarter.      22        Credit Facility     See for details regarding the 2016 Amended Credit Agreement.     Despite the current challenging economic environment, the Company believes that cash flows from operations along with available borrowings from its 2016 Amended Credit Agreement will be a sufficient source of liquidity. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company's business, and its continued expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through Christmas holiday season, which falls within the Company's second fiscal quarter, is expected to generate nearly 50% of the Company's annual revenues, and all of its earnings. As a result, the Company generates significant cash from operations during its second quarter, and then utilizes that cash for operating needs during its fiscal third and fourth quarters. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, the Company expects to close on the sale of its Fannie May transaction (see - Dispositions for details regarding the pending sale of Fannie May). The terms of the Company's 2016 Credit Facility provide for the reinvestment of such sale proceeds within a 24 month period following closing. Until such time, or until the Company reinvests such proceeds, the proceeds from the sale will be used for working capital needs, reducing the amount that the Company expects to borrow against its Revolver to fund pre-holiday manufacturing and inventory purchases during its first and second quarter of fiscal 2018. Borrowings under the Revolver typically peak in November, at which time cash generated from operations during the Christmas holiday shopping season is expected to enable the Company to repay any working capital borrowings prior to the end of December.     Stock Repurchase Program     The Company has a stock repurchase plan through which purchases can be made from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions, subject to general market conditions. The repurchase pro gram is financed utilizing available cash. In October 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an increase to its stock repurchase plan of up to $25 million. As of April 2, 2017, $19.7million remained authorized under the plan.     Contractual Obligations     There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business related to the Company's contractual obligations as discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 3, 2016.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     As disclosed in the Company 's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2016, the discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company's most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventory, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes. There have been no significant changes to the assumptions and estimates related to the Company's critical accounting policies, since July 3, 2016.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers." This amended guidance will enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices and will be applied to all contracts with customers. Expanded disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized are requirements under the amended guidance. This guidance will be effective for the Company's fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 and may be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.     In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, " Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs," which amends ASC 835-30, "Interest   Imputation of Interest." In order to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs, ASU No. 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, and not recorded as a separate asset. The Company adopted this standard effective July 4, 2016 and applied it retrospectively to all periods presented. The impact of the adoption of the new guidance was to reclassify $3.6 million of deferred financing costs previously included within "Other Assets" to "Long-term debt" in the consolidated balance sheets as of July 3, 2016.     In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, " Inventory (Topic 330)." The pronouncement was issued to simplify the measurement of inventory and changes the measurement from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending July 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.         23        In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, &quot;Financial Instruments   Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." The pronouncement requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. These changes become effective for the Company's fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. The adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.     In February 201 6, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)." Under this guidance, an entity is required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This guidance is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending June 28, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." ASU No. 2016-09 affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. ASU No. 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company has elected to early adopt the amendments in ASU 2016-09, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. As a result, stock-based compensation excess tax benefits are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of the provision for income taxes, whereas they were previously recognized in equity. This change resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits against income tax expenses, rather than additional paid-in capital, of $0.1 million and $0.9 million for the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017. There wasnoimpact on earnings per share sinceapproximately 700,000 tax benefit shares for thenine months ended April 2, 2017, previously associated with the APIC pool calculation, are no longer considered in the diluted share computation. Additionally, our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows now present excess tax benefits as an operating activity. This change has been applied prospectively in accordance with the ASU and prior periods have not been adjusted. Further, the Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures. The cumulative effect of this change, which was recorded as compensation expensein fiscal 2017, was not material to the financial statements. In addition, this ASU allows entities to withhold an amount up to an employees' maximum individual statutory tax rate in the relevant jurisdiction, up from the minimum statutory requirement, without resulting in liability classification of the award. We adopted this change on a modified retrospective basis, with no impact to our consolidated financial statements. Finally, this ASU clarified that the cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. This change does not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financials as it conforms with its current practice     . In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, " Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." ASU 2016-13 introduces a new forward-looking "expected loss" approach, to estimate credit losses on most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade receivables. The estimate of expected credit losses will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity's assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending July 4, 2021, and the guidance is to be applied using the modified-retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.      In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, &quot;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business (ASU 2017-01),&quot; which revises the definition of a business and provides new guidance in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. ASU 2017-01 is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied  prospectively, We do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.     In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, &quot;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04),&quot; which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017- 04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending July 4, 2021, with early adoption permitted,and should be applied prospectively. We do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.     Forward Looking Information and Factors that May Affe ct Future Results     Our disclosure and analysis in this report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent the Company 's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and can generally be identified by the use of statements that include words such as "estimate," "project," "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will," "goal," "target" or similar words or phrases. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of the Company's control that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including:             the Company 's ability:                     to achieve revenue and profitability;                     to leverage its operating platform and reduce operating expenses;                     to manage the increased seasonality of its business;                     to cost effectively acquire and retain customers;                     to effectively integrate and grow acquired companies, including the recent acquisition of Harry &amp; David;                     to reduce working capital requirements and capital expenditures;                     to compete against existing and new competitors;                     to manage expenses associated with sales and marketing and necessary general and administrative and technology investments; and                     to cost efficiently manage inventories;                the outcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings in the normal course of business; and                general consumer sentiment and economic conditions that may affect levels of discretionary customer purchases of the Company 's products.        We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or un known risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements.         24        We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects i n our Forms 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2016 listed various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historic results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers can find them in Part I, Item 1A, of that filing under the heading "Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995". We incorporate that section of that Form 10-K in this filing and investors should refer to it.     ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     The Company is exposed to market risk from the effect of interest rate changes.     Interest Rate Risk    The Company 's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment of available cash balances and its long-term debt. The Company generally invests its cash and cash equivalents in investment grade corporate and U.S. government securities. Due to the currently low rates of return the Company is receiving on its cash equivalents, the potential for a significant decrease in short-term interest rates is low and, therefore, a further decrease would not have a material impact on the Company's interest income. Borrowings under the Company's credit facility bear interest at a variable rate, plus an applicable margin, and therefore expose the Company to market risk for changes in interest rates. The effect of a 50 basis point increase in current interest rates on the Company's interest expense would be approximately $0.2 million and $0.6million during the three and nine months ended April 2, 2017, respectively.
