They do not include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and six month periods ended December 27, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending July 3, 2016. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2015.    The Company's quarterly results may experience seasonal fluctuations. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company's business, and its continued expansion into non-floral products, including the acquisition of Harry & David Holdings, Inc. ("Harry & David") on September 30, 2014, the Thanksgiving through Christmas holiday season, which falls within the Company's second fiscal quarter, is expected to generate nearly 50% of the Company's annual revenues, and all of its earnings. Additionally, due to the number of major floral gifting occasions, including Mother's Day, Valentine's Day and Administrative Professionals Week, revenues also rise during the Company's fiscal third and fourth quarters in comparison to its fiscal first quarter. The Easter Holiday, which was on April 5th in fiscal 2015, falls on March 27th in fiscal 2016. As a result of the timing of Easter, during fiscal 2016, all revenue and EBITDA associated with the Easter Holiday will shift into the Company's fiscal third quarter.    Use of Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements    In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2015-05, "Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement." This standard provides guidance to help entities determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license that should be accounted for as internal-use software or as a service contract. Upon adoption, an entity has the option to apply the provisions of ASU 2015-05 either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified, or retrospectively. This standard is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending July 2, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs," which amends ASC 835-30, "Interest   Imputation of Interest." In order to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs, ASU No. 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. This presentation is consistent with the guidance in Concepts Statement 6, which states that debt issuance costs are similar to a debt discount and in effect reduce the proceeds of borrowing, thereby increasing the effective interest rate. Concepts Statement 6 further states that debt issuance costs are not assets because they provide no future economic benefit. This new guidance is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending July 2, 2017 and should be applied retrospectively.    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." This amended guidance will enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices and will be applied to all contracts with customers. Expanded disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized are requirements under the amended guidance. This guidance will be effective for the Company's fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 and may be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.          5        In November 2015 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes," which will require entities to present deferred tax assets ("DTAs") and deferred tax liabilities ("DTLs") as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The ASU simplifies the current guidance (ASC 740-10-45-4), which requires entities to separately present DTAs and DTLs as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The ASU is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending July 1, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. TheFASB decided to allow all entities to early adopt the ASU for financial statements that had not been issued. Therefore, we adopted this ASU at December 27, 2015, and have reclassified all prior periods to be consistent with the requirements outlined in the ASU. The impact of the adoption was to reclassify and net $4.9 million of current deferred tax assets within long-term deferred tax liabilities, as of June 28, 2015.    Reclassifications    Certain balances in the prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. S ee "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" above regarding the impact of our adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 upon the classification of deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets.          Note 2   Net Income Per Common Share    The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share:           Note (1):    The effect of options to purchase 0.1 million shares for both the three and six months ended December 27, 2015 and 0.3 million and 0.6 million shares for the three and six months ended December 28, 2014, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of net income per share on a diluted basis as their effect is anti-dilutive.                     6       Note 3   Stock-Based Compensation The Company has a Long Term Incentive and Share Award Plan, which is more fully described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2015, that provides for the grant to eligible employees, consultants and directors of stock options, restricted shares, and other stock-based awards.     The amounts of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the periods presented are as follows:         Stock-based compensation is recorded within the following line items of operating expenses:         The following table summarizes stock option activity during the six months ended December 27, 2015:        As of December 27, 2015, the total future compensation cost related to non-vested options, not yet recognized in the statement of income, was $1.4 million and the weighted average period over which these awards are expected to be recognized was 3.4 years.          7         The Company grants shares of Common Stock to its employees that are subject to restrictions on transfer and risk of forfeiture until fulfillment of applicable service conditions and, in certain cases, holding periods (Restricted Stock). The following table summarizes the activity of non-vested restricted stock awards during the six months ended December 27, 2015:        The fair value of non-vested shares is determined based on the closing stock price on the grant date. As of December 27, 2015, there was $10.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock-based compensation to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining period of 2.7 years.         Note 4   Acquisitions and Dispositions    Acquisition of Harry & David    On September 30, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Harry & David, a leading multi-channel specialty retailer and producer of branded premium gift-quality fruit, gourmet food products and other gifts marketed under the Harry & David brands. The transaction, for a purchase price of $142.5 million, includes the Harry & David's brands and websites as well as its headquarters, manufacturing and distribution facilities and orchards in Medford, Oregon, a warehouse and distribution facility in Hebron, Ohio and 48 Harry & David retail stores located throughout the country.    During the quarter ended June 28, 2015, the Company finalized the allocation of the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on its estimates of their fair values on the acquisition date. The determination of the fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities (and the related determination of estimated lives of depreciable tangible and identifiable intangible assets) requires significant judgment. The estimates and assumptions include the projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future cash flows. Of the acquired intangible assets, $5.2 million was assigned to customer lists, which are being amortized over the estimated remaining lives of between 4 to 11 years, $35.5 million was assigned to trademarks, $1.1 million was assigned to leasehold positions and $16.0 million was assigned to goodwill, which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill recognized in conjunction with our acquisition of Harry & David is primarily related to synergistic value created in terms of both operating costs and revenue growth opportunities, enhanced financial and operational scale, and other strategic benefits. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce.          8         The following table summarizes the final allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition:        The estimated fair value of the acquired work in process and finished goods inventory was determined utilizing the income approach. The income approach estimates the fair value of the inventory based on the net retail value of the inventory less operating expenses and a reasonable profit allowance. Raw materials inventory was valued at book value, as there have not been any significant price fluctuations or other events that would materially change the cost to replace the raw materials.    The estimated fair value of the deferred revenue was determined based on the costs to perform the remaining services and/or satisfy the Company's remaining obligations, plus a reasonable profit for those activities. These remaining costs exclude sales and marketing expenses since the Deferred Revenue has already been "sold," and no additional sales and marketing expenses will be incurred. The reasonable profit to be earned on the deferred revenue was estimated based on the profit mark-up that the Company earns on similar services.    The estimated fair value of property, plant and equipment was determined utilizing a combination of the cost, sales comparison, market, and excess earnings method approaches, as follows:    Under the cost approach a replacement cost of the asset is first determined based on replacing the real property with assets of equal utility and functionality, developed based on both the indirect and the direct cost methods. The indirect cost method includes multiplying the assets' historical costs by industry specific inflationary trend factors to yield an estimated replacement cost. In applying this method, all direct and indirect costs including tax, freight, installation, engineering and other associated soft costs were considered. The direct cost method includes obtaining a current replacement cost estimate from the Company and equipment dealers, which includes all applicable direct and indirect costs. An appropriate depreciation allowance is then applied to the replacement cost based on the effective age of the assets relative to the expected normal useful lives of the assets, condition of the assets, and the planned future utilization of the assets. The determination of fair value also includes considerations of functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence, where applicable.    The sales comparison approach was considered for certain real estate property. Under the sales comparison approach, an estimate of fair value is determined by comparing the property being valued to similar properties that have been sold within a reasonable period from the valuation date, applying appropriate units of comparison.    The market approach was considered for certain assets with active secondary markets including agricultural equipment, automobiles, computer equipment, general equipment, mobile equipment, packaging machinery and semi-tractors. Under the market approach market, comparables for the assets are obtained from equipment dealers, resellers, industry databases, and published price guides. The market comparables are then adjusted to the subject assets based on age, condition or type of transaction. All applicable direct and indirect costs are also considered and reflected in the final fair value determination.          9        The fair value of orchards in production was determined based on the excess earnings method under the income approach. This valuation approach assumed that the orchards' production could be sold independently through a wholesale market rather than Harry & David's retail channel. The excess earnings method required calculating future crop revenue as determined by multiplying the future crop volume in tons to be produced by the projected price per ton based on the USDA "Agricultural Prices" report released January 31, 2015 by the National Agricultural Statistics Services. Appropriate expenses were deducted from the sales attributable to the orchards and economic rents were charged for the return on contributory assets. The after-tax cash flows attributable to the asset were discounted back to their net present value at an appropriate rate of return and summed to calculate the value of the orchards.    The estimated fair value of the acquired trademarks was determined using the relief from royalty method, which is a risk-adjusted discounted cash flow approach. The relief from royalty method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset. The relief from royalty method requires identifying the future revenue that would be generated by the trademark, multiplying it by a royalty rate deemed to be avoided through ownership of the asset and discounting the projected royalty savings amounts back to the acquisition date. The royalty rate used in the valuation was based on a consideration of market rates for similar categories of assets. The discount rate used in the valuation was based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital, the riskiness of the earnings stream association with the trademarks and the overall composition of the acquired assets.    The estimated fair value of the acquired customer lists was determined using the excess earnings method under the income approach. This method requires identifying the future revenue that would be generated by existing customers at the time of the acquisition, considering an appropriate attrition rate based on the historical experience of the Company. Appropriate expenses are then deducted from the revenues and economic rents are charged for the return on contributory assets. The after-tax cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted back to their net present value at an appropriate intangible asset rate of return and summed to calculate the value of the customer lists.    Disposition of Colonial Gifts Limited    On December 3, 2013, the Company completed its acquisition of a controlling interest in Colonial Gifts Limited ("iFlorist"). iFlorist, located in the UK, is a direct-to-consumer marketer of floral and gift-related products sold and delivered throughout Europe. The acquisition was achieved in stages and was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the FASB's guidance regarding business combinations.    During the quarter ended September 27, 2015, the Company's management committed to a plan to sell its iFlorist business in order to focus its internal resources and capital on integrating Harry & David and achieving expected synergy savings. During October 2015, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of iFlorist to Euroflorist AB ("Euroflorist"), a pan-European floral and gifting company headquartered in Malmo, Sweden. As consideration for the assets sold, the Company received an investment in Euroflorist with a fair value on the date of sale of approximately $1.5 million. The Company will account for this investment using the cost method as it does not possess the ability to exercise significant influence over Euroflorist.    As a result of the above, the Company determined that the iFlorist business (disposal group) met the held for sale criteria, as prescribed by FASB ASC 360-10-45-9, as of September 27, 2015. As a result, the Company compared iFlorist's carrying amount ($3.4 million) to its fair value less cost to sell ($1.5 million), and recorded an impairment charge of $1.9 million during the period ended September 27, 2015. The Company recorded this impairment charge within "Other (income) expense, net" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the quarter ended December 27, 2015, the Company completed the sale of the iFlorist business and recorded an additional loss on sale of $0.2 million.            10                Note 5   Inventory    The Company's inventory, stated at cost, which is not in excess of market, includes purchased and manufactured finished goods for sale, packaging supplies, crops, raw material ingredients for manufactured products and associated manufacturing labor and is classified as follows:             Note 6   Goodwill and Intangible Assets    The following table presents goodwill by segment and the related change in the net carrying amount:              (1)   The total carrying amount of goodwill for all periods in the table above is reflected net of $71.1 million of accumulated impairment charges, which were recorded in the Gourmet Food & Gift Baskets segment during fiscal 2009.    The Company's other intangible assets consist of the following:        Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Future estimated amortization expense is as follows: remainder of fiscal 2016 - $0.9 million, fiscal 2017 - $1.5 million, fiscal 2018 - $1.3 million, fiscal 2019 - $0.7 million, fiscal 2020 - $0.6 million and thereafter - $3.7 million.            11            Note 7   Investments    The Company has certain investments in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies. The Company accounts for these investments using the equity method if they provide the Company the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company has an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on the investee's Board of Directors, are considered in determining whether the equity method is appropriate. The Company records equity method investments initially at cost, and adjusts the carrying amount to reflect the Company's share of the earnings or losses of the investee.    The Company's equity method investments are comprised of a 32% interest in Flores Online, a Sao Paulo, Brazil based internet floral and gift retailer, that the Company made on May 31, 2012. The book value of this investment was $1.2 million as of December 27, 2015 and $2.9 million as of June 28, 2015 , and is included in Other assets within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company's equity in the net loss of Flores Online for the quarters ended December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014 was less than $0.1 million. During the quarter ended September 27, 2015, the Company determined that the fair value of its investment in Flores Online ($1.2 million) was below its carrying value ($2.9 million) and that this decline was other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 million, which is included within "Other (income) expense, net" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.    Investments in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, where the Company does not possess the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Cost method investments are originally recorded at cost, and are included within Other assets in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate carrying amount of the Company's cost method investments was $2.3 million as of December 27, 2015 (including a $1.5 million investment in Euroflorist   see Note 4 above) and $0.7 million as of June 28, 2015.    The Company also holds certain trading securities associated with its Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan ("NQDC Plan"). These investments are measured using quoted market prices at the reporting date and are included in Other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets (see Note 10).    Each reporting period, the Company uses available qualitative and quantitative information to evaluate its investments for impairment. When a decline in fair value, if any, is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.         Note 8  Debt    The Company's current and long-term debt consists of the following:              (1)      In order to finance the Harry & David acquisition, on September 30, 2014, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank as administrative agent, and a group of lenders (the "2014 Credit Facility"), consisting of a $142.5 million five-year term loan (the "Term Loan") with a maturity date of September 30, 2019, and a co-terminus revolving credit facility (the "Revolver"), with a seasonally adjusted limit ranging from $100.0 to $200.0 million, which may be used for working capital (subject to applicable sublimits) and general corporate purposes. The Term Loan is payable in 20 quarterly installments of principal and interest beginning in December 2014, with escalating principal payments at the rate of 10% in years one and two, 15% in years three and four, and 20% in year five, with the remaining balance of $42.75 million due upon maturity. Upon closing of the acquisition, the Company borrowed $136.7 million under the Revolver to repay amounts outstanding under the Company's and Harry & David's previous credit agreements, as well as to pay acquisition-related transaction costs.           12                 The 2014 Credit Facility requires that while any borrowings are outstanding the Company comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 27, 2015. Outstanding amounts under the 2014 Credit Facility bear interest at the Company's option at either: (i) LIBOR, plus a spread of 175 to 250 basis points, as determined by the Company's leverage ratio, or (ii) ABR, plus a spread of 75 to 150 basis points. The 2014 Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors.                    Future principal payments under the term loan are as follows: $7.1 million   2016, $19.6 million   2017, $21.4 million   2018, $26.7 million   2019 and $49.9 million  2020.           (2)   Bank loan assumed through the Company's acquisition of a majority interest in iFlorist. The Company repaid this loan during the quarter ended December 27, 2015.             Note 9 - Property, Plant and Equipment    The Company's property, plant and equipment consists of the following:            Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements    Cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Although no trading market exists, the Company believes that the carrying amount of its debt approximates fair value due to its variable nature. The Company's investments in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies are carried at cost and are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment, when an event or circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred. The Company's remaining financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value (see table below). The Company's non-financial assets, such as definite lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost and are assessed for impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist, as required under the accounting standards.          13        Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance are described below:       Level1      Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.           Level 2      Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.           Level 3      Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.     The following table presents by level, within the fair value hierarchy, financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:                  (1)   The Company has established a Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for certain members of senior management. Deferred compensation plan assets are invested in mutual funds held in a "rabbi trust" which is restricted for payment to participants of the NQDC Plan. Trading securities held in a rabbi trust are measured using quoted market prices at the reporting date and are included in Other assets, with the corresponding liability included in Other liabilities, in the consolidated balance sheets.            Note 11   Income Taxes                At the end of each interim reporting period, the Company estimates its effective income tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. This estimate is used in providing for income taxes on a year-to-date basis and may change in subsequent interim periods. The Company's effective tax rate from operations for the three months and six months ended December 27, 2015 was 33.2% and 32.8% respectively, compared to 36.9% and 36.8% in the same periods of the prior year. The effective rate for fiscal 2016 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the domestic production deduction and various tax credits such as employment credits and research and development credits that were recently renewed by U.S. Congress in December 2015, as well as the impact of the Company's reduced effective foreign tax rate in the UK resulting from the recent sale of iFlorist in October 2015, partially offset by state income taxes. The effective rate for fiscal 2015 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes, and other permanent differences, partially offset by tax credits. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign countries. The Company concluded its U.S. federal examination for fiscal 2011, however, fiscal years 2012 thru 2014 remain subject to U.S. federal examination. Due to ongoing state examinations and non-conformity with the U.S. federal statute of limitations for assessment, certain states remain open from fiscal 2011. The Company commenced operations in foreign jurisdictions in 2012. The Company's foreign income tax filings are open for examination by its respective foreign tax authorities, mainly Canada and the United Kingdom.       14         The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. At December 27, 2015 the Company has remaining unrecognized tax positions of approximately $0.6 million, including accrued interest and penalties of $0.1 million. The Company believes that none of its unrecognized tax positions will be resolved over the next twelve months         Note 12   Business Segments    The Company's management reviews the results of the Company's operations by the following three business segments:           1-800-Flowers.com Consumer Floral,         BloomNet Wire Service, and         Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets    Segment performance is measured based on contribution margin, which includes only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the segments. As such, management's measure of profitability for these segments does not include the effect of corporate overhead (see (*) below), nor does it include depreciation and amortization, other (income) expense, net and income taxes, or stock-based compensation and certain Harry & David acquisition/integration costs, both of which are included within corporate overhead. Assets and liabilities are reviewed at the consolidated level by management and not accounted for by segment.                  * Corporate expenses consist of the Company's enterprise shared service cost centers, and include, among other items, Information Technology, Human Resources, Accounting and Finance, Legal, Executive and Customer Service Center functions, as well as Stock-Based Compensation, and integration and acquisition costs related to the acquisition of Harry & David of $0 and $0.8 million during the three and six months ended December 27, 2015, respectively and $3.8 million and $4.5 million during the three and six months ended and December 28, 2014, respectively. In order to leverage the Company's infrastructure, these functions are operated under a centralized management platform, providing support services throughout the organization. The costs of thesefunctions, other than those of the Customer Service Center, which are allocated directly to the above segments based upon usage, are included within corporate expenses, as they are not directly allocable to a specific segment. The Company has commenced integration of Harry & David into its operating platforms, and as such, their operating costs have been classified in a similar manner.               15            Note 13   Commitments and Contingencies    Legal Proceedings    From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business:    Edible Arrangements:    On November 20, 2014, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut by Edible Arrangements LLC and Edible Arrangements International, LLC, alleging that the Company's use of the terms "Fruit Bouquets," "Edible," "Bouquet," "Edible Fruit Arrangements," Edible Arrangements," and "DoFruit" and its use of a six petal pineapple slice design in connection with marketing and selling edible fruit arrangements constitutes trademark infringement, false designation of origin, dilution, and contributory infringement under the federal Lanham Act, 29 USC   1114 and 1125(a), common law unfair competition, and a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, Connecticut General Statutes   42-110b (a). The Complaint alleges Edible Arrangements has been damaged in the amount of $97,411,000. The Complaint requests a declaratory judgment in favor of Edible Arrangements, an injunction against the Company's use of the terms and design, an accounting and payment of the Company's profits from its sale of edible fruit arrangements, a trebling of the Company's profits from such sales or of any damages sustained by Edible Arrangements, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. On November 24, 2014, the Complaint was amended to add a breach of contract claim for use of these terms and the design, based on a contract that had been entered by one of the Company's remote subsidiaries prior to its acquisition by the Company.    On January 29, 2015, the Plaintiffs amended the Complaint to add one of the Company's subsidiaries and to claim its damages were $ 101,436,000. The Company filed an Answer and a Counterclaim on February 27, 2015. The Answer asserts substantial defenses, including fair use by the Company of generic and descriptive terms, as expressly permitted under the Lanham Act, invalidity of Edible Arrangements' trademark registrations on grounds of fraud and trademark misuse, lack of exclusive rights on the part of Edible Arrangements, functionality of the claimed design mark, acquiescence, estoppel, and Edible Arrangements' use of the claimed trademarks in violation of the antitrust laws.    The Counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of lack of infringement and invalidity of claimed marks, cancellation of Edible Arrangements' registrations due to its fraud and misuse, genericism, and lack of secondary meaning as to any terms deemed descriptive, and damages in an amount to be determined for violation of the antitrust provisions of the federal Sherman Act and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act.    By Order dated May 4, 2015, the court ordered a phasing of the case and bifurcated the antitrust Counterclaim from the infringement claims. Discovery has begun and is continuing.    Edible Arrangements filed a motion to dismiss the Company's Sherman Act and Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act claims. The Company filed its brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss on July 10, 2015. On November 12, 2015, following oral argument before the Court, the Court denied Edible Arrangements' motion seeking to dismiss the Company's federal Sherman Act and Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act claims.    The Company believes its Counterclaims to the Edible Arrangements' claims are meritorious and that there are substantial defenses to all of the Edible Arrangements' claims and expects to defend the claims vigorously.          16        At this time, we are unable to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss for the aforementioned action for various reasons, including, among others: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate, (ii) the proceeding is in the early stages, and (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of the pending motion. As a result of the foregoing, we have determined that the amount of possible loss or range of loss is not reasonably estimable. However, legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which may be beyond our control.         Note 14. Fire at the Fannie May Warehouse and Distribution Facility    On November 27, 2014, a fire occurred at the Company's Maple Heights, Ohio warehouse and distribution facility. While the fire did not cause any injuries, the building was severely damaged, rendering it inoperable for the key calendar 2014 holiday season, and all Fannie May and Harry London confections in the facility were destroyed. As a result, the Company had limited supplies of its Fannie May Fine Chocolates and Harry London Chocolates products available in its retail stores as well as for its ecommerce and wholesale channels during the 2014 holiday season. While the Company implemented contingency plans to increase production for Fannie May Fine Chocolates and Harry London Chocolates products at its production facility in Canton, Ohio and to shift warehousing and distribution operations to alternate Company facilities, product availability was severely limited, impacting revenue and earnings during the fiscal second and third quarters of fiscal 2015.    The following table reflects the costs related to the fire and the insurance recovery and associated gain as of December 27, 2015:        During the three months ended September 27, 2015, the Company and its insurance carrier reached final agreement, and during the three months ended December 27, 2015, the Company received all remaining proceeds from its Fannie May fire claim. The agreement, in the amount of $55.0 million, provided for: (i) recovery of raw materials and work-in-process at replacement cost, and finished goods at selling price, less costs to complete the sale and normal discounts and other charges, as well as (ii) other incremental fire-related costs. The cost of inventory lost in the fire was approximately $29.6 million, while other fire-related costs amounted to approximately $5.8 million, including incremental contracted lease and cold storage fees which will be incurred until the Company moves back into its leased facility once the landlord completes repairs, currently anticipated before the end of the Company's third quarter of fiscal 2016. The resulting gain of $19.6 million is included in "Other (income) expense, net" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the period ended December 27, 2015.            17

On September 30, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Harry & David Holdings, Inc. ("Harry & David"), a leading multi-channel specialty retailer and producer of branded premium gift-quality fruit, gourmet food products and other gifts marketed under the Harry & David, Wolferman's and Cushman's brands. The transaction, at a purchase price of $142.5 million, included the Harry & David's brands and websites as well as its headquarters, manufacturing and distribution facilities and orchards in Medford, Oregon, a warehouse and distribution facility in Hebron, Ohio and 46 Harry & David retail stores located throughout the country. Harry & David's revenues were approximately $386 million in fiscal 2014, with Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $28 million. The historical results of Harry & David, as well as applicable pro forma results are included in the Company's Form 8-K/A filed on December 16, 2014.    In order to finance the acquisition, on September 30, 2014, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank as administrative agent, and a group of lenders (the "2014 Credit Facility"), consisting of a $142.5 million five-year term loan (the "Term Loan") with a maturity date of September 30, 2019, and a co-terminus revolving credit facility (the "Revolver"), with a seasonally adjusted limit ranging from $100.0 to $200.0 million, which may be used for working capital (subject to the applicable sublimit) and general corporate purposes.          18        Shares in 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, ticker symbol: FLWS.    Category Information    The following table presents the net revenues, gross profit and category contribution margin from each of the Company's business segments, as well as consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. (Due to certain one-time items, the following Non-GAAP reconciliation tables have been included within MD&A. In order to present comparable information, the financial information for the three and six months ended December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014 is also being presented on a pro-forma basis to give effect to the Harry & David acquisition as if it had been completed on June 30, 2014. This pro-forma information has been prepared by management for informational purposes only, and is not necessarily indicative of or intended to represent the results that would have been achieved had the acquisition been consummated as of this date. The pre-acquisition operating results of Harry & David, for the three months ended September 28, 2014, included within this pro-forma information, do not reflect any operating efficiencies and/or cost savings that the Company may achieve with respect to the combined companies, but have been adjusted to give effect to non-recurring items that are directly attributable to the acquisition.)              19                  20         Reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income attributable to 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.:              21         Reconciliation of net income attributable to 1-800-Flowers.com, Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA, excluding stock-based compensation (**):          (*)   Corporate expenses consist of the Company's enterprise shared service cost centers, and include, among other items, Information Technology, Human Resources, Accounting and Finance, Legal, Executive and Customer Service Center functions, as well as Stock-Based Compensation. In order to leverage the Company's infrastructure, these functions are operated under a centralized management platform, providing support services throughout the organization. The costs of these functions, other than those of the Customer Service Center, which are allocated directly to the abovecategories based upon usage, are included within corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific segment.       (**)   Performance is measured based on segment contribution margin or segment Adjusted EBITDA, reflecting only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the segments. As such, management's measure of profitability for these segments does not include the effect of corporate overhead, described above, depreciation and amortization, other income (net), nor does it include one-time charges or gains. Management utilizes EBITDA, and adjusted financial information, as a performance measurement tool because it considers such information a meaningful supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization. The Company also uses EBITDA and adjusted financial information as one of the factors used to determine the total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees. The Company's credit agreement uses EBITDA and adjusted financial information to measure compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence. EBITDA and adjusted financial information is also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates. EBITDA and adjusted financial information have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs; (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Company's debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should only be used on a supplemental basis combined with GAAP results when evaluating the Company's performance.         22         Results of Operations    Net Revenues       Net revenues consist primarily of the selling price of the merchandise, service or outbound shipping charges, less discounts, returns and credits.    Net revenues increased 2.6% during the three months ended December 27, 2015, compared to the same period of the prior year as a result of growth within the Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segment, primarily attributable to the impact on prior year revenues of the Thanksgiving Day Fannie May warehouse fire, as well as growth from Harry & David, Cheryl's and 1-800-Baskets wholesale gift basket businesses, partially offset by declines in the BloomNet segment, resulting from timing of wholesale orders which shifted into the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, and the Consumer Floral segment due to the impact of the sale of the iFlorist and Fine Stationery businesses during October 2015 and June 2015, respectively.

On a comparable basis, assuming the acquisition of Harry & David and dispositions of iFlorist and Fine Stationery occurred on June 30, 2014, and adjusting for the estimated lost revenues associated with the warehouse fire in the prior year, pro-forma net revenues during the six months ending December 27, 2015 of $703.4 million were favorable in comparison to prior year net revenues of $697.7 million, by 0.8%.

During the three months ended December 27, 2015, the Company fulfilled approximately 5,205,000 orders through its e-commerce sales channels (online and telephonic sales), compared to approximately 5,302,000 during the same period of the prior year, while the average order value increased to $79.20during the three months ended December 27, 2015from $77.16 during the same period ofthe prior year.

Other revenues increased by 8.7% during the three months ended December 27, 2015, compared to the same period of the prior year, due to increased revenues within the Gourmet Food & Gift Baskets segment primarily due to an increase in wholesale 1-800-Baskets/DesignPac gift basket orders, and the impact on prior year revenues of the Thanksgiving Day Fannie May warehouse fire.    Other revenues increased by 11.7% during the six months ended December 27, 2015, compared to the same period of the prior year, due to growth within the Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segment, resulting from the incremental revenue generated by Harry & David, which was acquired on September 30, 2014 , increased sales for 1-800-Baskets/DesignPac and the impact of the Thanksgiving Day Fannie May warehouse fire on prior year revenues.

On a comparable basis, adjusting for the impact of the dispositions of iFlorist and Fine Stationery, pro-forma net revenues during the three and six months ending December 27, 2015 increased 1.1% and 0.5% respectively.    The BloomNet Wire Service segment includes revenues from membership fees as well as other product and service offerings to florists. Net revenues decreased 2.2% during the three months ended December 27, 2015 compared to the same period of the prior year primarily as a result of a timing shift of wholesale product orders which moved to the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Net revenues for the for the six months ended December 27, 2015, increased 2.7% compared to the same period of the prior year, due to a combination of higher wholesale volume, and BloomNet initiatives including the implementation of a new florist transaction program in the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2015 .

Net revenues for the six months ended December 27, 2015 increased 10.9% compared to the same period of the prior year, as a result of the incremental revenue generated by Harry & David, which was acquired on September 30, 2014, the impact on prior year revenues of the Thanksgiving Day Fannie May warehouse fire, as well as order growth within Cheryl's and 1-800-Baskets/DesignPac wholesale gift basket business.

At the same time, gross margin percentage increased 160 basis points to 40.3% during the three months ended December 27, 2015, and 120 basis points to 39.9% during the six months ended December 27, 2015 in comparison to the same periods of the prior year, due to lower promotions, sourcing and shipping savings, as well as the dispositions of iFlorist and Fine Stationery which carried lower overall gross margins. On a comparable basis, adjusting for the impact of the dispositions of iFlorist and Fine Stationery, pro-forma gross profit during the three months ending December 27, 2015 of $38.2 million was favorable in comparison to prior year gross profit of $36.4 million, by 4.8%, and gross margin percentage increased 140 basis points to 40.3% in the current period, while pro-forma gross profit during the six months ending December 27, 2015 of $66.7 million was favorable in comparison to prior year gross profit of $64.2 million by 3.9%, and gross margin percentage increased 130 basis points to 40.0%.          25        The BloomNet Wire Service segment gross profit increased by 1.2% and 3.7%, respectively, and gross margin percentage increased 180 basis points and 50 basis points, to 56.9% and 55.7%, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 27, 2015, in comparison to the same periods of the prior year, primarily due to revenue mix, including an increase in higher margin membership fees.

During the six months ended December 27, 2015, Gourmet Food & Gift Baskets segment gross profit increased 12.7% and 70 basis points to 46.3%, compared to the same period of the prior year as a result of the incremental revenue and associated gross margins generated by Harry & David, which was acquired on September 30, 2014, the recovery from the Thanksgiving Day Fannie May warehouse fire, as well as Cheryl's and 1-800-Baskets/DesignPac wholesale business. On a comparable basis, assuming the acquisition of Harry & David occurred on June 30, 2014, and adjusting for the estimated lost gross profit associated with the warehouse fire in the prior year, gross profit of $229.6 million during the six months ending December 27, 2015was favorable in comparison to prior year pro-forma gross profit of $228.7 million by 0.4%, while gross margin percentage decreased 20 basis points to 46.3%.     Marketing and Sales Expense       Marketing and sales expense consists primarily of advertising and promotional expenditures, catalog costs, online portal and search costs, retail store and fulfillment operations (other than costs included in cost of revenues) and customer service center expenses, as well as the operating expenses of the Company's departments engaged in marketing, selling and merchandising activities.    Marketing and sales expense decreased 2.0% during the three months ended December 27, 2015, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to the improved spend ratio across all segments as a result of efficiencies gained in the marketing campaigns as well as the dispositions of iFlorist and Fine Stationery in October 2015 and June 2015, respectively, both of which carried a higher marketing spend ratio. On a comparable basis, assuming the acquisition of Harry & David occurred on June 30, 2014 and adjusting for the estimated lost revenues from the Fannie May warehouse fire, marketing and sales expense as a percentage of net revenues, would have been 21.8% during the three months ending December 27, 2015 compared to 22.3% during the three months ending December 28, 2014.    Marketing and sales expense increased 9.2% during the six months ended December 27, 2015, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily as a result of the incremental marketing expenses of Harry & David, which was acquired on September 30, 2014. Similarly, as a percentage of net revenues, marketing and selling expenses increased from 23.8% during the six months ended September 28, 2014 to 24.4% during the six months ended December 27, 2015 as a result of the seasonality of the Harry & David business which is heavily weighted towards the Company's fiscal second quarter. On a comparable basis, assuming the acquisition of Harry & David occurred on June 30, 2014 and adjusting for the estimated lost revenues from the Fannie May warehouse fire, marketing and sales expense as a percentage of net revenues, would have been 24.4% during the six months ending December 27, 2015 compared to 24.6% during the six months ending December 28, 2014.          26         Technology and Development Expense        Technology and development expense consists primarily of payroll and operating expenses of the Company's information technology group, costs associated with its websites, including hosting, design, content development and maintenance and support costs related to the Company's order entry, customer service, fulfillment and database systems.    Technology and development expenses increased 5.5% during the three months ended December 27, 2015, compared to the same period of the prior year, as a result of increased license and maintenance costs to support the Company's IT infrastructure.    Technology and development expenses increased 28.3% during the six months ended December 27, 2015, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to the technology and development costs of Harry & David, which was acquired on September 30, 2014, as well as increased license and maintenance costs to support the Company's IT infrastructure. On a comparable basis, assuming the acquisition of Harry & David occurred on June 30, 2014 and adjusting for the estimated lost revenues from the Fannie May warehouse fire, technology and development expense as a percentage of net revenues, would have been 2.7% during the six months ending December 27, 2015 compared to 2.6% during the six months ending December 28, 2014.    General and Administrative Expense       General and administrative expense consists of payroll and other expenses in support of the Company's executive, finance and accounting, legal, human resources and other administrative functions, as well as professional fees and other general corporate expenses.    General and administrative expense decreased 21.5% during the three months ended December 27, 2015 compared to the same period of the prior year, as a result of transaction expenses related to the Harry & David acquisition of $3.8 million incurred during the three months ended December 28, 2014, as well as integration, synergy and performance bonus cost reductions. On a comparable basis, assuming the acquisition of Harry & David occurred on June 30, 2014 and adjusting for the estimated lost revenues from the Fannie May warehouse fire, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues, would have been 3.7% during the three months ending December 27, 2015 compared to 3.9% during the three months ending December 28, 2014.    General and administrative expense increased 2.0% during the six months ended December 27, 2015 compared to the same period of the prior year, as result of the incremental general and administrative expense of Harry & David, which was acquired on September 30, 2014. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 5.7% in the six months ended December 27, 2015 from 5.9% during the same period of the prior year, due to a decrease in acquisition and integration expenses related to the Harry & David acquisition ($0.8 million in the six months ended December 27, 2015, and $4.5 million incurred in the six months ended December 28, 2014), as well as integration, synergy and performance bonus cost reductions. On a comparable basis, assuming the acquisition of Harry & David occurred on June 30, 2014 and adjusting for the estimated lost revenues from the Fannie May warehouse fire, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues, would have been 5.7% during the six months ending December 27, 2015 compared to 6.1% during the six months ending December 28, 2014.          27        Depreciation and Amortization Expense       Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 0.9% the three months ended December 27, 2015, in comparison to the same period of the prior year due to the Company's technology improvements . Depreciation and amortization expense increased 21.4% duringthe six months ended December 27, 2015, in comparison to the same period of the prior year, as a result of the incremental depreciation and amortization expenses of Harry & David, acquired on September 30, 2014, including the impact of the additional intangibles amortization,as well as a result of the Company's technology improvements.    Interest Expense, net       Interest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs attributable to the Company's credit facility, net of income earned on the Company's available cash balances.    Interest expense, net decreased during the three months ended December 27, 2015 in comparison to the same period of the prior year, as a result of scheduled repayments of the Term Loan used to finance the Harry & David acquisition.    Interest expense, net increased during the six months ended December 27, 2015 in comparison to the same period of the prior year, as a result of the additional interest expense and deferred financing costs associated with the Term Loan used to finance the Harry & David acquisition, entered into on September 30, 2014 and the additional interest expense on the Company's revolver to fund the working capital requirements of Harry & David during the first quarter of the current fiscal year.    Other (income) expense, net        Other (income) expense, net for the three months ended December 27, 2015 consists primarily of a $0.2 million loss on the sale of iFlorist (see Note 4 above).    Other (income) expense, net for the six months ended December 27, 2015 consists primarily of a $19.6 million gain on insurance recoveries related to the Fannie May warehouse fire, offset by a $2.1 million impairment of iFlorist assets held for sale and loss on sale, a $1.7 million impairment of the Flores Online investment, and a decline in the value of Non-qualified deferred compensation investments.          28        Income Taxes     The Company recorded income tax expense of $30.5 million and $27.3 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 27, 2015, compared to income tax expense of $27.3 million and $23.9 million, respectively for the same periods of the prior year. The Company's effective tax rate from operations for the three months and six months ended December 27, 2015 was 33.2% and 32.8% respectively, compared to 36.9% and 36.8% in the same periods of the prior year. The effective rate for fiscal 2016 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the domestic production deduction and various tax credits such as employment credits and research and development credits that were recently renewed by U.S. Congress in December 2015, as well as the impact of the Company's reduced effective foreign tax rate in the UK resulting from the recent sale of iFlorist in October 2015, partially offset by state income taxes. The effective rate for fiscal 2015 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes, and other permanent differences, partially offset by tax credits. At December 27, 2015 the Company has remaining unrecognized tax positions of approximately $0.6 million, including accrued interest and penalties of $0.1 million. The Company believes that none of its unrecognized tax positions will be resolved over the next twelve months.      Liquidity and Capital Resources    Cash Flows   At December 27, 2015, the Company had working capital of $76.4 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $108.4 million, compared to working capital of $31.5 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $27.9 million, at June 28, 2015. Note that the June 28, 2015 working capital balance has been restated due to the adoption of ASU No. 2015-17, which reclassified $4.9 million of current deferred tax assets within long-term deferred tax liabilities, resulting in a corresponding reduction in working capital.     Net cash provided by operating activities of $111.6 million for the six months ended December 27, 2015, was primarily attributable to the Company's net income during the period, adjusted by non-cash charges for depreciation/amortization, stock based compensation and the impairments/sale of iFlorist and a foreign equity investment, as well as seasonal changes in working capital, including holiday related increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and collection of the Fannie May fire insurance settlement, partially offset by increases in receivables related to holiday season sales.    Net cash used in investing activities of $13.1 million for the six months ended December 27, 2015, was primarily attributable to capital expenditures related to the Company's technology infrastructure, as well as improvements and equipment purchases within the Gourmet Food & Gift Baskets segment.    Net cash used in financing activities of $18.1 million for the six months ended December 27, 2015 was primarily for term debt repayments of $7.1 million and the acquisition of $11.2 million of treasury stock. All borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility during the six months ended December 27, 2015 were repaid by the end of the period.    Credit Facility    In order to finance the acquisition of Harry & David, on September 30, 2014, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank as administrative agent, and a group of lenders (the "2014 Credit Facility"), consisting of a $142.5 million five-year term loan (the "Term Loan") with a maturity date of September 30, 2019, and a co-terminus revolving credit facility (the "Revolver"), with a seasonally adjusted limit ranging from $100.0 to $200.0 million, which may be used for working capital (subject to applicable sublimits) and general corporate purposes. The Term Loan is payable in 20 quarterly installments of principal and interest beginning in December 2014, with escalating principal payments at the rate of 10% in years one and two, 15% in years three and four, and 20% in year five, with the remaining balance of $42.75 million due upon maturity. Upon closing of the acquisition, the Company borrowed $136.7 million under the Revolver to repay amounts outstanding under the Company's and Harry & David's previous credit agreements, as well as to pay acquisition-related transaction costs.    The 2014 Credit Facility requires that while any borrowings are outstanding the Company comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. Outstanding amounts under the 2014 Credit Facility will bear interest at the Company's option at either: (i) LIBOR, plus a spread of 175 to 250 basis points, as determined by the Company's leverage ratio, or (ii) ABR, plus a spread of 75 to 150 basis points. The 2014 Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors.          29        Despite the current challenging economic environment, the Company believes that cash flows from operations along with available borrowings from its 2014 Credit Facility will be a sufficient source of liquidity. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company's business, and its continued expansion into non-floral products, including the acquisition of Harry & David, the Thanksgiving through Christmas holiday season, which falls within the Company's second fiscal quarter, is expected to generate nearly 50% of the Company's annual revenues, and all of its earnings. As a result, the Company generated significant cash from operations during its second quarter, which it will then utilize for operating needs during its fiscal third and fourth quarters, after which time the Company expects to borrow against its Revolver to fund pre-holiday manufacturing and inventory purchases during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Borrowings under the Revolver will typically peak in November, at which time cash generated from operations during the Christmas holiday shopping season are expected to again enable the Company to repay working capital borrowings prior to the end of its second quarter of fiscal 2017.    Stock Repurchase Program    The Company has a stock repurchase plan through which purchases can be made from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions, subject to general market conditions. The repurchase program is financed utilizing available cash. In June 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an increase of $25 million to its stock repurchase plan. As of December 27, 2015, $16.0 million remains authorized under the plan.    Contractual Obligations    There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business related to the Company's contractual obligations as discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 28, 2015.    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    As disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2015, the discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company's most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventory, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes. There have been no significant changes to the assumptions and estimates related to the Company's critical accounting policies, since June 28, 2015.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, "Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement." This standard provides guidance to help entities determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license that should be accounted for as internal-use software or as a service contract. Upon adoption, an entity has the option to apply the provisions of ASU 2015-05 either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified, or retrospectively. This standard is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending July 2, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs," which amends ASC 835-30, "Interest   Imputation of Interest." In order to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs, ASU No. 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. This presentation is consistent with the guidance in Concepts Statement 6, which states that debt issuance costs are similar to a debt discount and in effect reduce the proceeds of borrowing, thereby increasing the effective interest rate. Concepts Statement 6 further states that debt issuance costs are not assets because they provide no future economic benefit. This new guidance is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending July 2, 2017 and should be applied retrospectively.          30        In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." This amended guidance will enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices and will be applied to all contracts with customers. Expanded disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized are requirements under the amended guidance. This guidance will be effective for the Company's fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 and may be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.    In November 2015 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes," which will require entities to present deferred tax assets ("DTAs") and deferred tax liabilities ("DTLs") as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The ASU simplifies the current guidance (ASC 740-10-45-4), which requires entities to separately present DTAs and DTLs as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The ASU is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending July 1, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. TheFASB decided to allow all entities to early adopt the ASU for financial statements that had not been issued. Therefore, we adopted this ASU at December 27, 2015, and have reclassified all prior periods to be consistent with the requirements outlined in the ASU. The impact of the adoption was to reclassify and net $4.9 million of current deferred tax assets within long-term deferred tax liabilities, as of June 28, 2015.
