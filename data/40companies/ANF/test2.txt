NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION  Nature of Business  Abercrombie& Fitch Co. ("A&F"), through its subsidiaries (collectively, A&F and its subsidiaries are referred to as "Abercrombie & Fitch" or the "Company"), is a specialty retailer of branded apparel and accessories. The Company operates stores in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East and direct-to-consumer operations in North America, Europe and Asia that serve its customers throughout the world.  Principles of Consolidation  The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include historical financial statements of, and transactions applicable to, the Company and reflect its assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows.  The Company has interests in a United Arab Emirates business venture and in a Kuwait business venture with Majid al Futtaim Fashion L.L.C. ("MAF"), each of which meets the definition of a variable interest entity ("VIE"). The Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these VIEs; therefore, the Company has consolidated the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs.  Fiscal Year  The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January31. All references herein to "Fiscal 2016 " and "Fiscal 2015 " represent the fifty-two week fiscal years ending on January 28, 2017 and ended on January 30, 2016 , respectively.  Interim Financial Statements  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of July 30, 2016 , and for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015 , are unaudited and are presented pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Accordingly, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto contained in A&F's Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2015 filed with the SEC on March 28, 2016. The January 30, 2016 consolidated balance sheet data, included herein, were derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").  In the opinion of management, the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments (which are of a normal recurring nature) necessary to state fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods, but are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be anticipated for Fiscal 2016 . 6  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could affect the Company's financial statements:  * Early adoption is permitted. 7  2. NET LOSS PER SHARE  Net loss per basic and diluted share is computed based on the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock.  The following table presents weighted-average shares outstanding and anti-dilutive shares:  (1) Reflects the total number of shares related to outstanding share-based compensation awards that have been excluded from the computation of net loss per diluted share because the impact would have been anti-dilutive.   3. FAIR VALUE  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized based on a three-level hierarchy. The three levels of inputs to measure fair value are as follows:    Level 1-inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities that are available in active markets that the Company can access at the measurement date.   Level 2-inputs are other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for assets or liabilities, directly or indirectly.   Level 3-inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable.  The lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. The three levels of the hierarchy and the distribution within it of the Company's assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, were as follows:  The Level 2 assets and liabilities consist of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined by using quoted market prices of the same or similar instruments, adjusted for counterparty risk. 8  Fair value of borrowings:  The Company's borrowings under the Company's credit facilities are carried at historical cost in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For disclosure purposes, the Company estimated the fair value of borrowings outstanding based on market rates for similar types of debt, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs.  The carrying amount and fair value of the Company's term loan facility were as follows:  No borrowings were outstanding under the Company's senior secured revolving credit facility as of July 30, 2016 or January 30, 2016 .   4. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET  Property and equipment, net consisted of:  Long-lived assets, primarily comprised of leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets might not be recoverable. These include, but are not limited to, material declines in operational performance, a history of losses, an expectation of future losses, other than temporary adverse market conditions and store closure or relocation decisions. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company reviews for indicators of impairment at the individual store level, the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable.  Stores that display an indicator of impairment are subjected to an impairment assessment. The Company's impairment assessment requires management to make assumptions and judgments related, but not limited, to management's expectations for future operations and projected cash flows. The key assumptions used in the Company's undiscounted future cash flow models include sales, gross margin and, to a lesser extent, operating expenses.  An impairment loss would be recognized when these undiscounted future cash flows are less than carrying amount of the asset group. In the circumstance of impairment, the loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. The key assumptions used in estimating the fair value of impaired assets may include projected cash flows and discount rate.  In the second quarter of Fiscal 2016, the Company incurred non-cash asset impairment charges of $6.4 million as it was determined that the carrying value of certain store assets would not be recoverable and exceeded fair value. These asset impairment charges are related to the Company's abercrombie kids flagship store in London.  In the year-to-date period of Fiscal 2015, the Company incurred non-cash asset impairment charges of $6.1 million related to a decision to remove certain store fixtures in connection with changes to the Abercrombie and Hollister store experiences, and a fair value adjustment related to the Company-owned aircraft which was sold in the second quarter of Fiscal 2015.  The Company had $38.1 million and $37.3 million of construction project assets in property and equipment, net at July 30, 2016 and January 30, 2016 , respectively, related to the construction of buildings in certain lease arrangements where the Company is deemed to be the owner of the construction project. 9  5. INCOME TAXES   The Company's quarterly tax provision and the estimate of the annual effective tax rate are subject to significant variation due to several factors. These include variability in the pre-tax jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in how the Company does business including entering into new businesses or geographies, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in law, regulations, and administrative practices, relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized and the impact of discrete items. The impact of these items on the effective tax rate will be greater at lower levels of pre-tax income (loss) .  6. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  The Company recognized share-based compensation expense of $4.4 million and $11.0 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 , respectively, and $7.2 million and $14.1 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2015 , respectively. The Company also recognized tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $1.7 million and $4.1 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 , respectively, and $2.5 million and $4.8 million for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2015 , respectively.  Stock Options  The following table summarizes stock option activity for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 :  Stock Appreciation Rights  The following table summarizes stock appreciation rights activity for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 :  As of July 30, 2016 , there was $6.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock appreciation rights. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 14 months .  The grant date fair value of stock appreciation rights that vested during the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015 was $4.0 million and $4.2 million , respectively. 10  Restricted Stock Units  The following table summarizes activity for restricted stock units for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 :  Fair value of both service-based and performance-based restricted stock units is calculated using the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant reduced for anticipated dividend payments on unvested shares. In determining fair value, the Company does not take into account performance-based vesting requirements. Performance-based vesting requirements are taken into account in determining the number of awards expected to vest. For market-based restricted stock units, fair value is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation with the number of shares that ultimately vest dependent on the Company's total stockholder return measured against the total stockholder return of a select group of peer companies over a three-year period. For an award with performance-based or market-based vesting requirements, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary from 0% to 200% of target depending on the level of achievement of performance criteria. Unvested shares related to restricted stock units with performance-based vesting conditions are reflected at 100% of their target vesting amount in the table above.  Service-based restricted stock units are expensed on a straight-line basis over the total requisite service period, net of forfeitures. Performance-based restricted stock units subject to graded vesting are expensed on an accelerated attribution basis, net of forfeitures. Market-based restricted stock units without graded vesting features are expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures.  As of July 30, 2016 , there was $48.8 million , $2.4 million and $3.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to service-based, performance-based and market-based restricted stock units, respectively. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 17 months , 16 months and 15 months for service-based, performance-based and market-based restricted stock units, respectively.  Additional information pertaining to restricted stock units for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015 follows: 11  The weighted-average assumptions used for market-based restricted stock units in the Monte Carlo simulation during the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015 were as follows:   7. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  The Company is exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, to manage the financial impacts of these exposures. The Company does not use forward contracts to engage in currency speculation and does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  The Company uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with forecasted foreign-currency-denominated intercompany inventory sales to foreign subsidiaries and the related settlement of the foreign-currency-denominated intercompany receivables. Fluctuations in exchange rates will either increase or decrease the Company's intercompany equivalent cash flows and affect the Company's U.S. Dollar earnings. Gains or losses on the foreign currency exchange forward contracts that are used to hedge these exposures are expected to partially offset this variability. Foreign currency exchange forward contracts represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed upon settlement date. These forward contracts typically have a maximum term of twelve months . The sale of the inventory to the Company's customers will result in the reclassification of related derivative gains and losses that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCL"). Substantially all of the unrealized gains or losses related to designated cash flow hedges as of July 30, 2016 will be recognized in cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, over the next twelve months .  The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, our master netting and other similar arrangements allow net settlements under certain conditions.  As of July 30, 2016 , the Company had outstanding the following foreign currency exchange forward contracts that were entered into to hedge either a portion, or all, of forecasted foreign-currency-denominated intercompany inventory sales, the resulting settlement of the foreign-currency-denominated intercompany accounts receivable, or both:  (1) Amounts are reported in U.S. Dollars equivalent as of July 30, 2016 .  The Company also uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge certain foreign-currency-denominated net monetary assets/liabilities. Examples of monetary assets/liabilities include cash balances, receivables and payables. Fluctuations in exchange rates result in transaction gains/(losses) being recorded in earnings as U.S. GAAP requires that monetary assets/liabilities be remeasured at the spot exchange rate at quarter-end or upon settlement. The Company has chosen not to apply hedge accounting to these instruments because there are no differences in the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instruments and the hedged items. 12  As of July 30, 2016 , the Company had outstanding the following foreign currency exchange forward contracts that were entered into to hedge foreign-currency-denominated net monetary assets/liabilities:  (1) Amounts are reported in U.S. Dollars equivalent as of July 30, 2016 .  The location and amounts of derivative fair values on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 30, 2016 and January 30, 2016 were as follows:  Refer to Note 3, " FAIR VALUE, " for further discussion of the determination of the fair value of derivative financial instruments.  13  The location and amounts of derivative gains and losses for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015 on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss were as follows:   (1) The amount represents the change in fair value of derivative contracts due to changes in spot rates. (2) The amount represents the reclassification from AOCL into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings, which is when merchandise is sold to the Company's customers. (3) The amount represents the change in fair value of derivative contracts due to changes in the difference between the spot price and forward price that is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and, therefore, recognized in earnings.  14  8. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS  The activity in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 was as follows:  (1) For the thirteen weeks ended July 30, 2016 , a gain was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization line item on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. For the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 , a loss was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization line item on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.  The activity in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2015 was as follows:  (2) For the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2015 , a loss was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.  15  9. SEGMENT REPORTING  The Company has two operating segments: Abercrombie, which includes the Company's Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands; and Hollister. These operating segments have similar economic characteristics, classes of consumers, products, and production and distribution methods, and have been aggregated into one reportable segment.  The following table provides the Company's net sales by operating segment for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015 .  The following table provides the Company's net sales by geographic area for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015 .   10. CONTINGENCIES  The Company is a defendant in lawsuits and other adversary proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Legal costs incurred in connection with the resolution of claims and lawsuits are generally expensed as incurred, and the Company establishes reserves for the outcome of litigation where losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. The Company's assessment of the current exposure could change in the event of the discovery of additional facts with respect to legal matters pending against the Company or determinations by judges, juries, administrative agencies or other finders of fact that are not in accordance with the Company's evaluation of claims. As of July 30, 2016 , the Company had accrued charges of approximately $10 million for certain legal contingencies. In addition, there are certain claims and legal proceedings pending against the Company for which accruals have not been established. Actual liabilities may exceed the amounts reserved, and there can be no assurance that final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Additionally, for the quarter ended July 30, 2016 , the Company recognized a $12.3 million gain in other operating income, net in connection with a settlement of certain economic loss claims associated with the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. 16

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   OVERVIEW  BUSINESS SUMMARY  The Company is a specialty retailer that operates stores in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East and direct-to-consumer operations in North America, Europe and Asia that serve its customers throughout the world. The Company sells casual sportswear apparel, including knit tops and woven shirts, graphic t-shirts, fleece, jeans and woven pants, shorts, sweaters, and outerwear; personal care products; and accessories for men, women and kids under the Abercrombie& Fitch, abercrombie kids and Hollister brands.  The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January31. Fiscal years are designated in the consolidated financial statements and notes by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. All references herein to "Fiscal 2016 " represent the fifty-two week fiscal year that will end on January 28, 2017 , and to "Fiscal 2015 " represent the fifty-two week fiscal year that ended January 30, 2016 .  For the second quarter of Fiscal 2016 , net sales decreased  4% to $783.2 million from $817.8 million for the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 . The gross profit rate for the second quarter of Fiscal 2016 was 60.9% compared to 62.3% for the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 . Operating loss was $10.8 million for the second quarter of Fiscal 2016 compared to operating income of $2.0 million for the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 .

For the Fiscal 2016 year-to-date period, net sales decreased  4% to $1.469 billion from $1.527 billion for the comparable period of Fiscal 2015 . The gross profit rate for the Fiscal 2016 year-to-date period was 61.5% compared to 60.3% for the comparable period of Fiscal 2015 . Operating loss was $65.7 million for the Fiscal 2016 year-to-date period compared to $88.2 million for the comparable period of Fiscal 2015 . Net loss and net loss per diluted share attributable to A&F were $52.7 million and $0.78 , respectively, for the Fiscal 2016 year-to-date period, compared to net loss and net loss per diluted share attributable to A&F of $64.1 million and $0.92 , respectively, for the comparable period of Fiscal 2015 . Excluding certain items, the adjusted non-GAAP gross profit rate was 60.9% , operating loss was $16.7 million and net loss and net loss per diluted share attributable to A&F were $16.8 million and $0.25 , respectively, for the second quarter of 2016 , compared to adjusted non-GAAP gross profit rate of 62.0% , operating income of $16.5 million , and net income and net income per diluted share attributable to A&F of $8.6 million and $0.12 , respectively, for the second quarter of 2015 . Excluding certain items, adjusted non-GAAP gross profit rate was 61.5% , operating loss was $71.6 million and net loss and net loss per diluted share attributable to A&F were $56.4 million and $0.83 , respectively, for the year-to-date period of Fiscal 2016 , compared to adjusted non-GAAP gross profit rate of 61.9% , operating loss of $35.9 million , and net loss and net loss per diluted share attributable to A&F of $28.6 million and $0.41 , respectively, for the year-to-date period of Fiscal 2015 .

Net cash used by operating activities was $57.9 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 . The Company also used cash of $58.0 million for capital expenditures and $27.0 million to pay dividends during the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 .  17  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes discussion of certain financial measures under "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" are useful to investors as they provide a measure of the Company's operating performance as compared to historical periods, excluding the effect of certain items which the Company believes do not reflect its future operating outlook, and therefore supplements investors' understanding of comparability across periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be used supplemental to, not as an alternative to, the Company's GAAP financial results, and may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.  Changes in comparable sales are calculated on a constant currency basis by converting prior year store and online sales at current year exchange rates. For the purpose of this calculation, a store must have been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage must not have been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year.  In addition, the following financial measures are disclosed on a GAAP basis and, as applicable, on a non-GAAP basis excluding items relating to asset impairment, claims settlement benefits, inventory write-down, net, legal settlement charges, store fixture disposal, profit improvement initiative, lease termination and store closure costs and restructuring benefit: cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization; gross profit; stores and distribution expense; marketing, general and administrative expense; other operating income, net; operating (loss) income; income tax (benefit) expense; effective tax rate; net loss attributable to A&F; and, net loss per diluted share attributable to A&F. Certain of these GAAP and non-GAAP measures are also expressed as a percentage of net sales. The income tax effect of non-GAAP items is calculated as the difference in income tax (benefit) expense with and without the non-GAAP adjustments to income before income taxes based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates of the affected tax jurisdictions. Management used these non-GAAP financial measures during the periods presented to assess the Company's performance and to develop expectations for future operating performance. 18  The tables below reconcile GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015 .  (1)  Refer to "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" for details on excluded items.  Due to the seasonal nature of the retail apparel industry, the results of operations for any current period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year. The seasonality of the Company's operations may also lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts. 19  CURRENT TRENDS AND OUTLOOK  Traffic remained a significant headwind for the second quarter of Fiscal 2016 as flagship and tourist stores, which are concentrated in the Abercrombie brand, accounted for the vast majority of the comparable sales decline across brands and geographies. Comparable sales improvement from the first quarter in international markets, driven by a recovery in the Hollister European business, including in the U.K., was offset by a decline in the U.S. trend. In addition, we saw strong growth in our direct-to-consumer business, both domestically and internationally.  During the quarter, we began to roll out programs that reflect our new brand positions for both the Abercrombie and Hollister brands. Our goal for Abercrombie is to be the iconic American casual luxury brand for today's twenty-something consumer, and our goal for Hollister is to be the iconic brand of the global teenage consumer. While still in the early stages, a clearly defined brand image and voice is beginning to be communicated across all customer touch points.  As we look to the rest of the year, we expect the environment to remain challenging with flagship and tourist locations continuing to weigh on the business. We are confident, however, that we are focusing on the right priorities and we expect to see traction in our business over time as we introduce new product and invest in marketing to drive awareness and relevance for our brands.  For Fiscal 2016, we now expect:   Comparable sales to remain challenging through the second half of the year, with a disproportionate effect from flagship and tourist locations .   Adverse effects from foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating income.   A gross margin rate flat to last year's adjusted non-GAAP rate of 61.9%, but down in the third quarter due to adverse effects from foreign currency .   Operating expense dollars to be down slightly to last year's adjusted non-GAAP operating expense, with investments in marketing, skewed towards the third quarter, offset by savings from expense reduction efforts   An effective tax rate in the mid-to-upper 30s .   Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of approximately $5 million    A weighted average diluted share count of approximately 68 million shares, excluding the effect of potential share buybacks .  We expect capital expenditures to be at the low end of the range of $150 million to $175 million for the full year.  We plan to open approximately 15 new stores in Fiscal 2016, including approximately 10 in international markets, primarily China, and approximately five in the U.S. We also plan to open six new outlet stores, primarily in the U.S. In addition, we anticipate closing up to 60 stores in the U.S. during the fiscal year through natural lease expirations.  Excluded from our outlook are the effects of certain potential items, including, but not limited to, insurance recoveries and impairments. 20  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  STORE ACTIVITY  Store count and gross square footage by brand for the thirteen weeks ended July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015 , respectively, were as follows:  (1)  Includes Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands.  (2)  Excludes one international franchise store as of July 30, 2016 and April 30, 2016.  (3)  Excludes two international franchise stores as of July 30, 2016 and April 30, 2016. 21  Store count and gross square footage by brand for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015 , respectively, were as follows:  (1)  Includes Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands.  (2)  Excludes one international franchise store as of July 30, 2016 and January 30, 2016.  (3)  Excludes two international franchise stores as of July 30, 2016 and January 30, 2016. 22  Net Sales  (1) Changes in comparable sales are calculated on a constant currency basis by converting prior year store and online sales at current year exchange rates. For the purpose of this calculation, a store must have been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage must not have been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year.  (2) Includes Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands.  For the second quarter and year-to-date period of Fiscal 2016 , net sales decreased  4% compared to the second quarter and year-to-date period of Fiscal 2015 , primarily attributable to a 4% decrease in comparable sales in each period, mainly driven by flagship and tourist stores across both brands and geographies. 23  Cost of Sales, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization  (1)  Inventory write-down charges related to a first quarter of Fiscal 2015 decision to accelerate the disposition of certain aged merchandise, net of recoveries realized during the second quarter Fiscal 2015.  For the second quarter of Fiscal 2016 , cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 140 basis points as compared to the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 , primarily due to the adverse effects from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 90 basis points and the net impact of higher average unit costs partially offset by higher average unit retails. Excluding certain items, presented in the table above, second quarter Fiscal 2016 adjusted non-GAAP cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 110 basis points as compared to the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 .  For the year-to-date period of Fiscal 2016 , cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of net sales decreased by approximately 110 basis points as compared to the year-to-date period of Fiscal 2015 , which included a $24.2 million , net inventory write-down. Excluding the $24.2 million , net inventory write-down, year-to-date Fiscal 2016 adjusted non-GAAP cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 40 basis points as compared to the year-to-date period of Fiscal 2015 , primarily due to the adverse effects from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 80 basis points and the net impact of higher average unit cost partially offset by higher average unit retails.  24  Stores and Distribution Expense  For the second quarter of Fiscal 2016 , stores and distribution expense as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 130 basis points as compared to the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 , primarily due to the deleveraging effect of negative comparable sales and higher direct-to-consumer expense, partially offset by expense reduction efforts. Excluding certain items, presented in the table above, second quarter Fiscal 2016 adjusted non-GAAP stores and distribution expense as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 150 basis points as compared to the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 .  For the year-to-date period of Fiscal 2016 , stores and distribution expense as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 10 basis points as compared to the year-to-date period of Fiscal 2015 , primarily due to the deleveraging effect from negative comparable sales and higher direct-to-consumer expense, partially offset by expense reduction efforts.

As is typical in the apparel industry, the Company experiences its greatest sales activity during the Fall season due to Back-to-School and Holiday sales periods. The Company relies on excess operating cash flows, which are largely generated in the Fall season, to fund operating expenses throughout the year and to reinvest in the business to support future growth. The Company also has a revolving credit facility available as a source of additional funding.  Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility  The Company has a senior secured revolving credit facility with availability of up to $400 million (the "ABL Facility"), subject to a borrowing base. The ABL Facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The ABL Facility will mature on August 7, 2019. No borrowings were outstanding under the ABL Facility as of July 30, 2016 .  Amounts borrowed under the ABL Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at either an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 1.75% per annum, or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 0.25% to 0.75% per annum based on average historical excess availability during the preceding quarter. The Company is also required to pay a fee of 0.25% per annum on undrawn commitments under the ABL Facility. Customary agency fees and letter of credit fees are also payable in respect of the ABL Facility.  As of July 30, 2016 , the borrowing base on the ABL Facility was $312.9 million . As of September 1, 2016, the Company had not drawn on the ABL Facility, but had approximately $1.8 million in outstanding stand-by letters of credit under the ABL Facility.  Term Loan Facility  The Company is also party to a term loan agreement, which provides for a term loan facility of $300 million (the "Term Loan Facility" and, together with the ABL Facility, the "2014 Credit Facilities"). The Term Loan Facility was issued at a $3 million or 1.0% discount. In addition, the Company recorded deferred financing fees associated with the issuance of the 2014 Credit Facilities of $5.8 million in aggregate, of which $3.2 million was paid to lenders. The Company is amortizing the debt discount and deferred financing fees over the respective contractual terms of the 2014 Credit Facilities.  The Company's Term Loan debt is presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of the unamortized discount and fees paid to lenders. Net borrowings as of July 30, 2016 were as follows:  The Term Loan Facility will mature on August 7, 2021 and amortizes at a rate equal to 0.25%of the original principal amount per quarter, beginning with the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014. The Term Loan Facility is subject to (a) beginning in 2016, an annual mandatory prepayment in an amount equal to 0% to 50% of the Company's excess cash flows in the preceding fiscal year, depending on the Company's leverage ratio and (b) certain other mandatory prepayments upon receipt by the Company of proceeds of certain debt issuances, asset sales and casualty events, subject to certain exceptions specified therein, including reinvestment rights. The Company was not required to make any mandatory prepayments under the Term Loan Facility in Fiscal 2016.  At the Company's option, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest at either (a) an adjusted LIBOR rate no lower than 1.00% plus a margin of 3.75% per annum or (b) an alternate base rate plus a margin of 2.75% per annum. Customary agency fees are also payable in respect of the Term Loan Facility. The interest rate on borrowings under the Term Loan Facility was 4.75% as of July 30, 2016 . 31  Operating Activities  Net cash used by operating activities was $57.9 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 compared to $20.8 million for the twenty-six weeks ended August 1, 2015 . The year-over-year change in cash flow associated with operating activities was primarily the result of the extension of vendor payment terms in the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 and incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of Fiscal 2016, partially offset by the return of a $22.8 million long-term lease deposit and a $22.4 million decrease in cash paid for income taxes in Fiscal 2016.  Investing Activities  Cash outflows for investing activities for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015 were used primarily for new construction, store updates, information technology, and direct-to-consumer and omnichannel capabilities.  Financing Activities  Cash outflows for financing activities consisted primarily of the payment of dividends of $27.0 million and $27.8 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015 , respectively.  As of July 30, 2016 , A&F had approximately 6.5 million remaining shares available for repurchase as part of the A&F Board of Directors' previously approved authorization.  FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS AND SOURCES OF CASH  Over the next twelve months, the Company's primary cash requirements will be to fund operating activities, including the acquisition of inventory, and obligations related to compensation, leases, taxes and other operating activities, as well as to fund capital expenditures, marketing initiatives, quarterly dividends to stockholders subject to approval by A&F's Board of Directors and debt service requirements, including required repayments, if any, based on annual excess cash flows, as defined in the term loan agreement. The Company has availability under the ABL Facility as a source of additional funding.  The Company expects total capital expenditures for Fiscal 2016 to be at the low end of the range of $150 million to $175 million, primarily for store remodels, new stores, direct-to-consumer and IT investments to support growth initiatives.  The Company may continue to repurchase shares of its Common Stock and would anticipate funding these cash requirements utilizing free cash flow generated from operations or proceeds from its existing credit facilities.  As of July 30, 2016 , $275.1 million of the Company's $455.6 million of cash and equivalents was held by foreign affiliates. The Company is not dependent on dividends from its foreign affiliates to fund its U.S. operations or pay dividends to A&F's stockholders. Unremitted earnings from foreign affiliates generally would become subject to U.S. income tax if remitted as dividends or lent to A&F or a U.S. affiliate. As of July 30, 2016 , a provision for U.S. income tax has not been recorded on approximately $214 million of the cash and equivalents held by foreign affiliates which is considered indefinitely invested in foreign operations.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  The Company uses, in the ordinary course of business, stand-by letters of credit under the existing ABL Facility. The Company had $1.8 million in stand-by letters of credit outstanding as of July 30, 2016 . The Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  The Company's contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases, purchase orders for merchandise inventory, unrecognized tax benefits, certain retirement obligations, lease deposits and other agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding and that require minimum quantities to be purchased. These contractual obligations impact the Company's short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. During the thirteen weeks ended July 30, 2016 , there were no material changes in the contractual obligations as of January 30, 2016 , with the exception of those obligations which occurred in the normal course of business (primarily changes in the Company's merchandise inventory-related purchases and lease obligations, which fluctuate throughout the year as a result of the seasonal nature of the Company's operations). 32  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  See Note 1, " BASIS OF PRESENTATION--Recent Accounting Pronouncements " of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in "ITEM 1.
