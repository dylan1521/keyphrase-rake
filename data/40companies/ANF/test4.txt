NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION  Nature of Business  Abercrombie& Fitch Co. ("A&F"), through its subsidiaries (collectively, A&F and its subsidiaries are referred to as "Abercrombie & Fitch" or the "Company"), is a specialty retailer of branded apparel and accessories. The Company operates through store and direct-to-consumer operations, as well as through various wholesale, franchise and licensing arrangements. The Company has operations in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.  Principles of Consolidation  The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include historical financial statements of, and transactions applicable to, the Company and reflect its assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows.  The Company has interests in a United Arab Emirates business venture and in a Kuwait business venture with Majid al Futtaim Fashion L.L.C. ("MAF"), each of which meets the definition of a variable interest entity ("VIE"). The Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these VIEs; therefore, the Company has consolidated the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs.  Fiscal Year  The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January31. All references herein to "Fiscal 2017 " and "Fiscal 2016 " represent the fifty-three week fiscal year ending on February 3, 2018 and the fifty-two week fiscal year ended on January 28, 2017 , respectively.  Interim Financial Statements  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of April 29, 2017 , and for the thirteen week periods ended April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 , are unaudited and are presented pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Accordingly, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto contained in A&F's Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2016 filed with the SEC on March27, 2017 . The January 28, 2017 consolidated balance sheet data, included herein, were derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").  In the opinion of management, the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments (which are of a normal recurring nature) necessary to state fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods, but are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be anticipated for Fiscal 2017 . 6  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could affect the Company's financial statements:  * Early adoption is permitted.   7  2. NET LOSS PER SHARE  Net loss per basic and diluted share is computed based on the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock.  The following table presents weighted-average shares outstanding and anti-dilutive shares:  (1) Reflects the total number of shares related to outstanding share-based compensation awards that have been excluded from the computation of net loss per diluted share because the impact would have been anti-dilutive.  3. FAIR VALUE  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized based on a three-level hierarchy. The three levels of inputs to measure fair value are as follows:    Level 1-inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities that are available in active markets that the Company can access at the measurement date.   Level 2-inputs are other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for assets or liabilities, directly or indirectly.   Level 3-inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable.  The lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. The three levels of the hierarchy and the distribution within it of the Company's assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, were as follows: 8  The Level 2 assets and liabilities consist of trust-owned life insurance policies and derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency exchange forward contracts. The fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts is determined by using quoted market prices of the same or similar instruments, adjusted for counterparty risk.  Fair value of borrowings:  The Company's borrowings under the Company's credit facilities are carried at historical cost in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For disclosure purposes, the Company estimated the fair value of borrowings outstanding based on market rates for similar types of debt, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs.  The carrying amount and fair value of the Company's term loan facility were as follows:  No borrowings were outstanding under the Company's senior secured revolving credit facility as of April 29, 2017 or January 28, 2017 .   4. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET  Property and equipment, net consisted of:  Long-lived assets, primarily comprised of leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets might not be recoverable. These include, but are not limited to, material declines in operational performance, a history of losses, an expectation of future losses, adverse market conditions and store closure or relocation decisions. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company reviews for indicators of impairment at the individual store level, the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable.  Stores that display an indicator of impairment are subjected to an impairment assessment. The Company's impairment assessment requires management to make assumptions and judgments related, but not limited, to management's expectations for future operations and projected cash flows. The key assumptions used in the Company's undiscounted future cash flow models include sales, gross profit and, to a lesser extent, operating expenses.  An impairment loss would be recognized when these undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. In the circumstance of impairment, the loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. The key assumptions used in estimating the fair value of impaired assets include projected cash flows and discount rate.  The Company incurred asset impairment charges of $0.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 . There were no asset impairment charges for the thirteen weeks ended April 30, 2016 .  The Company had $35.9 million and $35.6 million of construction project assets in property and equipment, net at April 29, 2017 and January 28, 2017 , respectively, related to the construction of buildings in certain lease arrangements where the Company is deemed to be the owner of the construction project. 9  5. INCOME TAXES   The Company's quarterly tax provision and the estimate of the annual effective tax rate are subject to significant variation due to several factors. These include variability in the pre-tax jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in how the Company does business including entering into new businesses or geographies, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in law, regulations, and administrative practices, relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized and the impact of discrete items. The impact of these items on the effective tax rate will be greater at lower levels of pre-tax income (loss).  In the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, the provision for income taxes also differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the tax effects of stock-based compensation. In the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09, "Compensation-Stock Compensation," which resulted in a discrete non-cash income tax charge of $9.3 million recognized in income tax benefit on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Refer to Note 1, " BASIS OF PRESENTATION--Recent Accounting Pronouncements " for further discussion regarding the adoption of this standard.   6. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  The Company recognized share-based compensation expense of $4.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 and $6.6 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 30, 2016 . The tax benefit associated with share-based compensation expense was $1.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 and $2.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 30, 2016 .  Stock Options  The following table summarizes stock option activity for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 :  Stock Appreciation Rights  The following table summarizes stock appreciation rights activity for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 :  As of April 29, 2017 , there was $2.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock appreciation rights. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 11 months .  The grant date fair value of stock appreciation rights that vested during the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 was $1.9 million and $3.7 million , respectively. 10  Restricted Stock Units  The following table summarizes activity for restricted stock units for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 :  (1) This includes 786,449 unvested restricted stock units as of April 29, 2017 that are subject to the requirement that the Company must achieve at least $1.00 of GAAP net income attributable to A&F for the fiscal year in order to vest.  Fair value of both service-based and performance-based restricted stock units is calculated using the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant reduced for anticipated dividend payments on unvested shares. In determining fair value, the Company does not take into account performance-based vesting requirements. Performance-based vesting requirements are taken into account in determining the number of awards expected to vest. For market-based restricted stock units, fair value is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation with the number of shares that ultimately vest dependent on the Company's total stockholder return measured against the total stockholder return of a select group of peer companies over a three-year period. For an award with performance-based or market-based vesting requirements, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary from 0% to 200% of target depending on the level of achievement of performance criteria. Unvested shares related to restricted stock units with performance-based vesting conditions are reflected at 100% of their target vesting amount in the table above.  Service-based restricted stock units are expensed on a straight-line basis over the total requisite service period, net of forfeitures. Performance-based restricted stock units subject to graded vesting are expensed on an accelerated attribution basis, net of forfeitures. Market-based restricted stock units without graded vesting features are expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures.  As of April 29, 2017 , there was $30.1 million , $4.9 million and $4.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to service-based, performance-based and market-based restricted stock units, respectively. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 17 months , 18 months and 16 months for service-based, performance-based and market-based restricted stock units, respectively.  The tax benefit associated with restricted stock vesting during the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 was $2.1 million and $4.9 million , respectively.  Additional information pertaining to restricted stock units for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 follows: 11  The weighted-average assumptions used for market-based restricted stock units in the Monte Carlo simulation during the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 were as follows:   7. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  The Company is exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, to manage the financial impacts of these exposures. The Company does not use forward contracts to engage in currency speculation and does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  The Company uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with forecasted foreign-currency-denominated intercompany inventory sales to foreign subsidiaries and the related settlement of the foreign-currency-denominated intercompany receivables. Fluctuations in exchange rates will either increase or decrease the Company's intercompany equivalent cash flows and affect the Company's U.S. Dollar earnings. Gains or losses on the foreign currency exchange forward contracts that are used to hedge these exposures are expected to partially offset this variability. Foreign currency exchange forward contracts represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed upon settlement date. These forward contracts typically have a maximum term of twelve months . The sale of the inventory to the Company's customers will result in the reclassification of related derivative gains and losses that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCL"). Substantially all of the unrealized gains or losses related to designated cash flow hedges as of April29, 2017 will be recognized in cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, over the next twelve months .  The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, the Company's Master International Swap Dealers Association, Inc., Agreement and other similar arrangements allow net settlements under certain conditions.  As of April 29, 2017 , the Company had outstanding the following foreign currency exchange forward contracts that were entered into to hedge either a portion, or all, of forecasted foreign-currency-denominated intercompany inventory sales, the resulting settlement of the foreign-currency-denominated intercompany accounts receivable, or both:  (1) Amounts reported are the U.S. Dollar notional amounts outstanding as of April29, 2017 .  The Company also uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge certain foreign-currency-denominated net monetary assets/liabilities. Examples of monetary assets/liabilities include cash balances, receivables and payables. Fluctuations in exchange rates result in transaction gains/(losses) being recorded in earnings as U.S. GAAP requires that monetary assets/liabilities be remeasured at the spot exchange rate at quarter-end or upon settlement. The Company has chosen not to apply hedge accounting to these instruments because there are no differences in the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instruments and the hedged items. 12  As of April 29, 2017 , the Company had outstanding the following foreign currency exchange forward contracts that were entered into to hedge foreign-currency-denominated net monetary assets/liabilities:  (1) Amounts reported are the U.S. Dollar notional amounts outstanding as of April 29, 2017 .  The location and amounts of derivative fair values on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of April29, 2017 and January28, 2017 were as follows:  Refer to Note 3, " FAIR VALUE, " for further discussion of the determination of the fair value of derivative instruments.  The location and amounts of derivative gains and losses for the thirteen weeks ended April29, 2017 and April30, 2016 on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss were as follows:   (1) The amount represents the change in fair value of derivative contracts due to changes in spot rates. (2) The amount represents the reclassification from AOCL into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings, which is when merchandise is sold to the Company's customers. (3) The amount represents the change in fair value of derivative contracts due to changes in the difference between the spot price and forward price that is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and, therefore, recognized in earnings.  13  8. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS  The activity in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the thirteen weeks ended April29, 2017 was as follows:  (1) For the thirteen weeks ended April29, 2017 , a gain was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.  The activity in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the thirteen weeks ended April 30, 2016 was as follows:  (2) For the thirteen weeks ended April30, 2016 , a gain was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.   9. SEGMENT REPORTING  The Company has two operating segments: Hollister; and Abercrombie, which includes the Company's Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands. These operating segments have similar economic characteristics, classes of consumers, products, and production and distribution methods, and have been aggregated into one reportable segment.  The following table provides the Company's net sales by operating segment for the thirteen weeks ended April29, 2017 and April30, 2016 .  14  The following table provides the Company's net sales by geographic area for the thirteen weeks ended April29, 2017 and April30, 2016 .   10. CONTINGENCIES  The Company is a defendant in lawsuits and other adversary proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Legal costs incurred in connection with the resolution of claims and lawsuits are generally expensed as incurred, and the Company establishes reserves for the outcome of litigation where losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. The Company's assessment of the current exposure could change in the event of the discovery of additional facts. Actual liabilities may exceed the amounts reserved, and there can be no assurance that final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. There are certain claims and legal proceedings pending against the Company for which accruals have not been established. 15  
ITEM2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   OVERVIEW  BUSINESS SUMMARY  The Company is a specialty retailer who primarily sells its products through store and direct-to-consumer operations, as well as through various wholesale, franchise and licensing arrangements. The Company offers a broad array of apparel products, including knit tops, woven shirts, graphic t-shirts, fleece, sweaters, jeans, woven pants, shorts, outerwear, dresses, intimates and swimwear; and personal care products and accessories for men, women and kids under the Hollister, Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands. The Company has operations in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.  The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January31. Fiscal years are designated in the consolidated financial statements and notes by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. All references herein to "Fiscal 2017 " represent the fifty-three week fiscal year that will end on February 3, 2018 , and to "Fiscal 2016 " represent the fifty-two week fiscal year that ended January 28, 2017 .  Due to the seasonal nature of the retail apparel industry, the results of operations for any current period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year. The seasonality of the Company's operations may also lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts.  SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The table below summarizes the Company's results of operations for the thirteen week periods ended April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 .  (1) Changes in comparable sales are calculated on a constant currency basis by converting prior year store and online sales at current year exchange rates. For inclusion in this calculation, a store must have been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage must not have been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year.  As of April29, 2017 , the Company had $421.4 million in cash and equivalents and $268.3 million in gross borrowings outstanding under its term loan facility. Net cash used by operating activities was $84.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended April29, 2017 . The Company also used cash of $32.1 million for capital expenditures and $13.6 million to pay dividends during the thirteen weeks ended April29, 2017 .  16  CURRENT TRENDS AND OUTLOOK  Our results for the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 reflect comparable sales improvement over the prior quarter in a continued challenging, promotional environment. Hollister, our largest brand, delivered an increase in comparable sales. At Abercrombie, sales results were in line with our expectations as we continue to lay the foundation for its revitalization.  While we anticipate the second quarter retail environment to remain promotional and generally challenging, we expect comparable sales trend improvement in the second half of the year, as we gain traction from our strategic investments in marketing, loyalty programs and omnichannel capabilities. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to our cost structure, with a balanced focus between dealing with short-term realities and driving towards our long-term ambition, and remain confident in our strategic direction and our ability to execute on our plans.  For Fiscal 2017, we expect:   Comparable sales to remain challenging in the second quarter, with trend improvement in the second half of the year .   Continued adverse impact from foreign currency on sales and operating income .   A gross profit rate down slightly to last year's adjusted non-GAAP rate of 61.0%, with continued pressure in the second quarter.   Operating expense to be down at least 3% from last year's adjusted non-GAAP operating expense of $2.025 billion, with approximately 65% of the full year reduction to occur in the second half of the year .   Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of approximately $4 million .   A weighted average diluted share count of approximately 68 million shares, excluding the effect of potential share buybacks .  For the full year, we expect the effective tax rate to reflect a core tax rate in the low 30s, which remains highly sensitive at lower levels of pre-tax earnings. Additionally, we expect discrete non-cash income tax charges for the full year of approximately $11 million primarily related to a change in share-based compensation accounting standards.  We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million for the full year.  We plan to open approximately seven full-price stores in Fiscal 2017, including six in the U.S. and one in international markets. We also plan to open two new outlet stores. In addition, we anticipate closing approximately 60 stores in the U.S. during the fiscal year through natural lease expirations.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes discussion of certain financial measures under "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company believes that each of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" are useful to investors as they provide a measure of the Company's operating performance excluding the effect of certain items which the Company believes do not reflect its future operating outlook, and therefore supplements investors' understanding of comparability across periods. Management used these non-GAAP financial measures during the periods presented to assess the Company's performance and to develop expectations for future operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be used supplemental to, not as an alternative to, the Company's GAAP financial results, and may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.  Changes in comparable sales are calculated on a constant currency basis by converting prior year store and online sales at current year exchange rates. For the purpose of this calculation, a store must have been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage must not have been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year.  17  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  STORE ACTIVITY  Store count and gross square footage by brand for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 , respectively, were as follows:  (1)  Excludes five international franchise stores as of April 29, 2017 , three international franchise stores as of January 28, 2017 and two international franchise stores as of April 30, 2016 and January 30, 2016. (2)  Includes Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands. Excludes three international franchise stores as of April 29, 2017 and one international franchise store as of January 28, 2017 , April 30, 2016 and January 30, 2016.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED APRIL 29, 2017 VERSUS THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED APRIL 30, 2016  Net Sales  (1) Changes in comparable sales are calculated on a constant currency basis by converting prior year store and online sales at current year exchange rates. For inclusion in this calculation, a store must have been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage must not have been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year. (2) Includes Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands.  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 , net sales decreased  4% as compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 , primarily attributable to a 3% decrease in comparable sales, driven by the Abercrombie brand. 18  Cost of Sales, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 , cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 180 basis points as compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 , primarily due to lower average unit retail, which includes the adverse effects from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 50 basis points, partially offset by lower average unit cost.  Stores and Distribution Expense  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 , stores and distribution expense as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 60 basis points as compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 , primarily due to the deleveraging effect from negative comparable sales and higher direct-to-consumer expense, partially offset by expense reduction efforts.  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 , shipping and handling costs, including costs incurred to store, move and prepare product for shipment and costs incurred to physically move product to the customer, associated with direct-to-consumer operations were $29.7 million as compared to $22.8 million for the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 .  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 , handling costs, including costs incurred to store, move and prepare product for shipment to stores, were $8.1 million as compared to $10.4 million for the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 .  Shipping and handling costs are included in stores and distribution expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.  Marketing, General and Administrative Expense  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 , marketing, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by approximately 10 basis points as compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 , primarily due to expense reduction efforts, partially offset by higher marketing expenses and the deleveraging effect from negative comparable sales.  Asset Impairment  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 , the Company incurred asset impairment charges of $0.7 million . There were no asset impairment charges for the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 . 19  Other Operating Income, Net  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 , other operating income, net as a percentage of net sales decreased by approximately 20 basis points as compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 , primarily due to lower foreign currency related gains.  Operating Loss  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 , operating loss as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 260 basis points as compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 , primarily driven by a reduction in the gross profit rate, the deleveraging effect from negative comparable sales, and higher direct-to-consumer and marketing expenses, partially offset by expense reduction efforts.  Interest Expense, Net  Income Tax Benefit  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 , the Company's income tax benefit as a percentage of loss before taxes was 17.6% as compared to 35.0% for the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 . The change in tax rate was primarily driven by a discrete non-cash income tax charge of $9.3 million related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, as well as changes in the level and mix of consolidated pre-tax earnings between operating and valuation allowance jurisdictions. The Company's effective income tax rate remains sensitive at lower levels of full year pre-tax earnings.  Net Loss and Net Loss per Share Attributable to A&F  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 , net loss and net loss per diluted share attributable to A&F were $61.7 million and $0.91 , respectively, as compared to net loss and net loss per diluted share attributable to A&F of $39.6 million and $0.59 , respectively, for the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 . 20  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  HISTORICAL SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  Seasonality of Cash Flows  The Company's business has two principal selling seasons: the Spring season, which includes the first and second fiscal quarters ("Spring"), and the Fall season, which includes the third and fourth fiscal quarters ("Fall"). As is typical in the apparel industry, the Company experiences its greatest sales activity during the Fall season due to Back-to-School and Holiday sales periods. The Company relies on excess operating cash flows, which are largely generated in the Fall season, to fund operations throughout the year and to reinvest in the business to support future growth. The Company also has a revolving credit facility available as a source of additional funding.  Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility  The Company has a senior secured revolving credit facility with availability of up to $400 million (the "ABL Facility"), subject to a borrowing base. The ABL Facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The ABL Facility will mature on August 7, 2019. No borrowings were outstanding under the ABL Facility as of April 29, 2017 .  Amounts borrowed under the ABL Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at either an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 1.75% per annum, or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 0.25% to 0.75% per annum based on average historical excess availability during the preceding quarter. The Company is also required to pay a fee of 0.25% per annum on undrawn commitments under the ABL Facility. Customary agency fees and letter of credit fees are also payable in respect of the ABL Facility.  As of April 29, 2017 , the borrowing base on the ABL Facility was $253.7 million . As of June1, 2017 , the Company had not drawn on the ABL Facility, but had approximately $1.8 million in outstanding stand-by letters of credit under the ABL Facility.  Term Loan Facility  The Company has a term loan agreement, which provides for a term loan facility of $300 million (the "Term Loan Facility" and, together with the ABL Facility, the "2014 Credit Facilities"). The Term Loan Facility was issued at a $3 million or 1.0% discount. In addition, the Company recorded deferred financing fees associated with the issuance of the 2014 Credit Facilities of $5.8 million in aggregate, of which $3.2 million was paid to lenders. The Company is amortizing the debt discount and deferred financing fees over the respective contractual terms of the 2014 Credit Facilities.  The Company's Term Loan debt is presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of the unamortized discount and deferred financing fees. Net borrowings as of April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 were as follows:  The Term Loan Facility will mature on August7, 2021 and amortizes at a rate equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount per quarter, beginning with the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014. The Term Loan Facility is subject to (a) beginning in 2016, an annual mandatory prepayment in an amount equal to 0% to 50% of the Company's excess cash flows in the preceding fiscal year, depending on the Company's leverage ratio and (b) certain other mandatory prepayments upon receipt by the Company of proceeds of certain debt issuances, asset sales and casualty events, subject to certain exceptions specified therein, including reinvestment rights, less any voluntary payments made. The Company made a repayment of $25 million in January 2017, in prepayment of its scheduled Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2021 amortization and a portion of the amount of principal due at maturity.  21  At the Company's option, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest at either (a) an adjusted LIBOR rate no lower than 1.00% plus a margin of 3.75% per annum or (b) an alternate base rate plus a margin of 2.75% per annum. Customary agency fees are also payable pursuant to the Term Loan Facility. The interest rate on borrowings under the Term Loan Facility was 4.75% as of April 29, 2017 .  Operating Activities  Net cash used by operating activities was $84.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 compared to $75.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 30, 2016 . The year-over-year change in cash flow associated with operating activities was primarily driven by greater net loss net of non-cash adjustments and lease deposits that were returned in the first quarter of Fiscal 2016, partially offset by year-over-year decreases in income tax and incentive compensation payments.  Investing Activities  Cash outflows for investing activities for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 included capital expenditures of $32.1 million and $26.0 million , respectively, primarily for store updates and new stores, as well as direct-to-consumer and omnichannel and information technology investments.  Financing Activities  For the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 , cash outflows for financing activities consisted primarily of dividend payments of $13.6 million and $13.5 million , respectively.  As of April 29, 2017 , A&F had approximately 6.5 million remaining shares available for repurchase as part of the A&F Board of Directors' previously approved authorization.  FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS AND SOURCES OF CASH  Over the next twelve months, the Company's primary cash requirements will be to fund operating activities, including the acquisition of inventory, and obligations related to compensation, leases, taxes and other operating activities, as well as to fund capital expenditures, marketing initiatives, quarterly dividends to stockholders subject to approval by A&F's Board of Directors and debt service requirements, including required repayments, if any, based on annual excess cash flows, as defined in the term loan agreement. The Company has availability under the ABL Facility as a source of additional funding.  The Company expects total capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million for Fiscal 2017 , primarily for store updates and new stores, as well as direct-to-consumer and omnichannel and information technology investments to support growth initiatives.  The Company may repurchase shares of its Common Stock and, if it were to do so, would anticipate funding such repurchases by utilizing free cash flow generated from operations or proceeds from the ABL Facility.  As of April 29, 2017 , $289.0 million of the Company's $421.4 million of cash and equivalents was held by foreign affiliates. The Company is not dependent on dividends from its foreign affiliates to fund its U.S. operations or pay dividends to A&F's stockholders. Unremitted earnings from foreign affiliates generally would become subject to U.S. income tax if remitted as dividends or lent to A&F or a U.S. affiliate.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  The Company uses, in the ordinary course of business, stand-by letters of credit under the existing ABL Facility. The Company had $1.8 million in stand-by letters of credit outstanding as of April 29, 2017 . The Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements. 22  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  The Company's contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases, purchase orders for merchandise inventory, unrecognized tax benefits, certain retirement obligations, lease deposits and other agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding and that require minimum quantities to be purchased. These contractual obligations impact the Company's short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. During the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 , there were no material changes in the contractual obligations as of January 28, 2017 , with the exception of those obligations which occurred in the normal course of business (primarily changes in the Company's merchandise inventory-related purchases and lease obligations, which fluctuate throughout the year as a result of the seasonal nature of the Company's operations).
